        "text": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS — Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt’s an experience that might humble some. But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year’s NFL Draft. He’s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he’s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had “nine or 10” formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn’t divulge which teams he’d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn’t been turned up high enough — yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday’s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board — perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he’s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft."

        "text": "8i announced today it has launched a web player, the 8i Portal, for its volumetric 3D video of people in virtual reality.\nUsing 8i’s technology and VR goggles, you’ll be able to walk around a person inside a virtual environment to see their entire being. The Wellington, New Zealand-based startup said its VR platform will allow you to view fully volumetric 3D video.\nPreviously, VR cameras could record a partial torso of a person, but the 8i Portal goes beyond that. It enables “complete freedom of movement,” and it gives you a sense of “presence,” or the feeling that you are there in the virtual space with the person. It creates a more “emotional connection with the person you are watching,” the company said in the video below.\n8i’s platform will let you create, experience, and share immersive 3D video of real people — for virtual reality, augmented reality, and the web. I’m not sure how it can be used for games, but you can see how it could give you a unique perspective at a music concert or theatrical performance.\nLinc Gasking, who previously ran countingdown.com (which DreamWorks acquired), and Eugene d’Eon, formerly of Weta Digital and Nvidia, founded the startup in 2014.\nTo date, 8i has raised $14.8 million in funding from investors including RRE Ventures, Founders Fund Science, Horizons Ventures, Samsung Ventures, Dolby Family Ventures, Signia Venture Partners, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, Sound Ventures, Inevitable Ventures, Freelands, and Advancit Capital.\nThe new 8i Portal is a volumetric VR player for Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive VR platforms. If you use the Oculus Rift or Vive headsets, you can view cool VR videos of people who look real, not computer-generated, and move around them, make eye contact, and feel “true presence,” the company said."

        "text": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county’s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon’s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world’s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents — including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups — felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project’s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world’s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon’s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it’s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt’s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon."

Gen. Bruce Oliveira shared details of the state’s probe and said when the mistake was realized, the employee “froze” and “seemed confused.” Another employee had to resume his duties and send a correction message, Oliveira said.\nThe employee also reportedly had at least two previous incidents in which he mistook drills for real-world events, including for tsunami and fire warnings. But Oliveira said the employee was previously counseled and allowed to resume his duties.\nFollowing the event, the employee was fired and Vern Miyagi, who oversaw the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, took responsibility and resigned.\nToby Clairmont, the agency’s executive officer, also resigned before disciplinary action could be taken, and authorities are in the process of suspending another worker without pay.\nBy 8:20 a.m., Hawaii EMA tweeted there was “NO missile threat” to the state, but failed to send a phone alert for another 38 minutes, causing mass panic among people who weren’t able to check social media.\nFox News’ Katherine Lam and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Baalbaki has no work of his own in this show.\nBorn in Safad, northern Palestine, around 1888-1890, Abbo was a farmer and fisherman who later took up carpentry and stone masonry. It was not until he moved to Berlin in 1911 to study sculpture that his artistic career took shape.\nBaalbaki has spent the last four years finding, and determining attribution for, 70 artworks and 100 texts mentioning the artist.\nBaalbaki says many of Abbo's sculptures didn't survive World War I. He believes those that were originally exhibited in museums in Germany were taken during the war and melted down to make weapons.\nAlongside Abbo's artworks are vintage photos of places he'd been or postcards from that time period, which Baalbaki says is to give an overall look at the life he led, in today's age of media and imagery.\nBaalbaki intends to continue his research and tracking down Abbo's works."

        "text": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer—specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys—for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand—its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail—that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey. A bricks-and-mortar nation turns its lonely eyes to you."

        "text": "University of Utah track and field athlete Lauren McCluskey was found shot dead Monday night in the backseat of a vehicle outside a campus dormitory, according to university police. The suspected shooter was 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, a man McCluskey’s family said she had recently stopped dating. Rowland’s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them “on Oct. 12 and Oct. 13” about threats from Rowland. There was “some follow-up” and it was assigned to a detective who was “working to build a case against our suspect at that time,” Brophy said. The police chief would not go into further details about what happened with that investigation.\nOn Monday night, Brophy said that police got a call from a frantic mother saying “something happened to her daughter.” In a statement released by the McCluskey family, McCluskey’s mother said that she was on the phone with her daughter that night when she suddenly heard Lauren McCluskey yell “no no no!” Afraid her daughter was in a car accident, she stayed on the line while her husband called 911. A few minutes later, the family statement said, “a young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren’s things were on the ground.” It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey’s body, Brophy said. The university issued an alert and an order for students to “secure-in-place.” It was lifted at 11:46 p.m., according to the university’s website, after police determined that Rowland was no longer on campus. Brophy said that Rowland was picked up by a vehicle and, about 1:15 a.m. he was spotted by Salt Lake City police who ran after him. Rowland got inside the Trinity AME Church, where he killed himself. A retired pastor told the Salt Lake Tribune that, to the best of his knowledge, Rowland didn’t attend the church and he had no idea why he chose that building.\nThe family of McCluskey, 21, said that their daughter had dated Rowland for about a month. She ended the relationship after she learned about his criminal history.\nLauren was a senior student athlete on the University of Utah track team. She was an outstanding student with a 3.75 GPA majoring in Communication and was excited to graduate in May 2019. She was a 2015 honors graduate of Pullman High School where she was Washington state champion in the high jump and the school record holder in the 100 meter hurdles. She attended Capital Church in Salt Lake City. She loved to sing and had strength and determination. She was dearly loved and will be greatly missed.\nPolice said the two had been in a “prior relationship,” but wouldn’t comment further. According to Utah Department of Corrections, Rowland was convicted in 2004 of enticing a minor, a second-degree felony, and attempted forcible sexual abuse, a third-degree felony. His last known home, Brophy said, was a halfway house."

        "text": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver â which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau â needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's TegraÂ 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in WindowsÂ 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in WindowsÂ 8.\nThe drivers for Video4LinuxÂ 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux."

The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. The results were presented last week at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society."

By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully."

No, not the serious one that HBO is doing with Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti, and not the overtly comedic one that Will Ferrell is set to star in. It’s Battle Of The Sexes, the middle one that’s supposed to be a comedy with “dramatic and political overtones”—as we said in an earlier report. Battle Of The Sexes comes from Little Miss Sunshine’s Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and it was set to star Emma Stone and Steve Carell as the eponymous sexes. Now, Stone has backed out due to “a scheduling conflict,” and the studio is reportedly in talks with Brie Larson to replace her.\nLarson recently appeared in Room, a film that is not only making some waves in the film festival circuit but also has a name that’s very similar to a certain other movie, which could end up causing a reverse-Asylum by tricking people who want to see a bad movie into seeing a good movie. She’s also set to be in Kong: Skull Island and possibly the eventual Godzilla fight movie that it’s going to set up."

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded — and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year."

It appears Feiglin is on his way back to the Knesset, while Tibi just sank below the threshold minimum vote.\nAn Israel Hayom poll published Friday morning shows former IDF chief of staff with 19 seats, the Likud down from 30 to 28, the Labor Party falling to its lowest point so far –5 seats, Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid stuck in the mud with 9 seats (down from its current 11, which is down from its previous Knesset list of 19), and, for the first time in this campaign, the Zehut (Identity) party, headed by former Likud MK Moshe Feiglin who is a regular pundit at Jewish Press Online, crossing the electoral threshold with 4 seats.\nThe numerous splits of the past few months, on the left and on the right—some of which may end up merging by the official deadline set by the Central Elections Committee, have led to many parties that are swinging just above or just below the: Gesher, headed by Orly Levy-Abekasis, receives 4 seats, while Shas, Meretz, Habayit Hayehudi receive only 3.\nHere’s another doozie: Both Avigdor Liberman and his nemesis Ahmad Tibi get only 3 seats and walk into the setting sun, probably not hand in hand.\nAnd like we said, Zehut, headed by Cool Hand Feiglin, which just held the first open primaries in Israel ever on Tuesday, and did it online (you gave them your ID number and cell number, they SMSed you a code, you clicked in and got to spread 6 points among the candidate/s of your choice) is also on the verge of the electoral threshold – but for the first time looking at the abyss from above, with 4 seats.\nParties that are so far from the threshold they’re already in Party Heaven (doesn’t that sound like the place you’d want to go when the time comes) are Tzipi Livni and Eli Yishai, each of whom receives but one mandate.\nThe survey examined a scenario according to which Gantz and Lapid unite and bring in former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi. The result: they all get 32 ​​mandates, with the Likud pushed to second place with 30, while Labor falls into the 3.25% abyss and goes to pole paradise with a measly 3 seats (down from 24).\nImmediately after Ganz’s speech, the Likud and New Right tried to associate Ganz with the left, while Resilient to Israel, Gantz’s party, what a name) insisted that theirs is a centrist party. Well, the poll showed that 25% of respondents still do not know how to define him.\nAfter the pollsters removed the “I don’t know” results, 52% of the rest located Gantz at the center, 19% see him as a right-winger, and 29% as left-winger.\nFinal surprise: on the issue of who is more suitable to be the next prime minister, Netanyahu leads safely with 38%, while Gantz gets only 22%."

        "text": "President Donald Trump returned to Washington, DC on Monday for a very important event.\nIt was not for a meeting with an international leader.\nAnd it was not for a joint session of Congress.\nNo, on this day, Trump greeted thousands of children. They had come to the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll.\nThe event has been a U.S. tradition for more than a century. In the late 1800s, local children gathered on the hill beside the president’s house to play a game with their colored eggs following the Easter holiday.\nThe White House Easter Egg Roll was of special interest this year. The Trump administration was very late to organize it. Some people who hoped to attend the event were even worried that it would be canceled.\nPolitical observers said the Easter Egg Roll would show how well Trump’s administration could plan and operate a complex public relations event.\nTalk about the event also brought attention to the first lady, whose office usually plans the White House Easter Egg Roll. First Lady Melania Trump has not yet moved to Washington, DC. She says she will remain in New York City until her son finishes the school year.\nSo, how did the White House Easter Egg Roll go this year?\nJust fine, early reports say.\nAbout 21,000 children and their families received tickets to this year’s event. They came in small groups to the lawn near the president’s house. They played soccer, tossed bean bags and, of course, pushed hard-boiled eggs down the hill.\nThe event was smaller than in previous years. Last year, for example, about 36,000 people attended.\nThis year’s Easter Egg Roll also did not include performances by top celebrities or professional athletes. Instead, children were invited to draw pictures for U.S. soldiers.\nThe Easter Bunny made an appearance, though, as did both Trump and the first lady. They were there with their 11-year-old son, Barron. The president welcomed his young guests and promised them that the nation was getting stronger, bigger, and better.\nKelly Jean Kelly wrote this story for Learning English.

        "text": "So you might ask yourself, “What is going on?” How can things be so bad that educators feel the need to petition?\nSuperintendent Michael Hanson’s administration issued a mandate to all school principals, vice principals and counselors to lower the number of suspensions and expulsions districtwide using a repackaged, rhetoric-filled behavioral modification program called Restorative Justice.\nThis Restorative Justice concept is not new. These interventions usually fail under the weight of their overexaggerated promises. This leads to an odd belief that if you decrease the number of official suspensions on paper, you can claim success regarding improved behavior.\nFresno Unified board member Christopher De La Cerda, McLane’s representative, highlighted this delusion when he stated, “The data confirms that restorative practices at McLane are working as we intended it to work.” Sort of like bragging that no one drowned in the pool after the water was removed.\nIf the intention was for more than 80 percent of the teaching staff to be so fed up they needed to file a petition – congratulations! Mission accomplished.\nThe saddest part of this debacle is that it has ironically resulted in increased insecurity and systemic violence for our teachers and students who truly want to be educated.\nBut here is the most disappointing fact: This situation did not need to happen; it was self-inflicted.\nThree years ago, there was a wonderful, accredited, academic program in Fresno Unified that took in up to 1,600 secondary students a year, who either could not – or should not – attend a traditional high school.\nThis program was a last-chance beacon of hope for thousands of students who, by their own fault or the fault of others, would have had no real chance of graduating from high school. It was called the J.E.Young Academic Center (JEY). It provided an educational sanctuary for the very students FUSD is trying to corral with this Restorative Justice debacle.\nEvery student was treated – educationally and emotionally – as a unique individual. JEY accepted the entire spectrum of students; from those whose special needs could not be adequately met, to those whose behaviors could not be adequately accommodated on a traditional high school campus. This program was an oasis for students on the precipice of failure.\nIt was a wonderful independent study program that served the needs of those most in need. Everybody won. But that didn’t matter.\nFor spurious and ego-driven reasons, this program was dismantled and diminished to a mere shell of its former self. It was replaced by a program that failed after two years. Like prisons, it involves removing those in society with unacceptable behaviors and placing them into a concentrated environment of only themselves.\nIf shooting oneself in the foot was considered a good thing, then FUSD could qualify as a world-class marksman regarding this issue. If FUSD really wanted to practice restorative justice, it would bring JEY back to its previous stature. Maybe Larry Powell could help.\nWilliam (Bill) Larkin monitors online credit-recovery classes in the Apex program. He taught in the JEY program for eight years.

        "text": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n\"Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,\" Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite\"supporting cast,\" as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to\"Nothing is written in stone,\" it is this: It's a bottom-line game."

What did kemo sabe mean? – boss, or pal, or champion of justice, or paleface idiot?\nWhen I was little, there was no radio in our house; our parents were deaf. Our grandparents had a big table-model Philco in their parlor. Just as kids nowadays tease for an iPhone, I kept asking for a radio until I got it. A tiny, dark-brown Bakelite-cased Arvin, it sat on the sideboard in our dining room.\nEvery weekday, from 4:45 till 6:00 in the afternoon, I pulled my long-legged chair up to the sideboard, turned on the radio, and gazed at the dial. Many of you must remember \"watching the radio\" and memorizing the numbers of the AM dial, from 520 to 1610 kilohertz. I could tell from the glances I got from my parents as I sat there – sitting still for longer than at any other time in my life – that they suspected I was listening to something inappropriate and possibly sinful.\nAt 4:45 a voice crackled over a simulated radio transmission: \"CX4 to control tower. CX4 to control tower. Standing by…\" The answer was immediate: \"Control tower to CX4. Wind southeast, ceiling 1200. All clear.\"\n\"This is Hop Harrigan, coming in!\" So it went: five 15-minute episodes, featuring Jack Armstrong, Captain Midnight; Terry and the Pirates, and finally Tom Mix.\nEvenings, there were half-hour shows – The Green Hornet; The Shadow, in real life Lamont Cranston, \"wealthy young man-about-town\" who once in the Orient had learned to \"cloud men’s minds so they cannot see him.\"\nEverything we imagined was the product of our separate minds’ eyes. When the Lone Ranger walked across the board platform of a railroad station, each of us constructed a different scene. It was like the famous \"driveway moments\" on Public Radio; you could do nothing else demanding thought while you were into an on-air drama. Listening to archived recordings now reveals it to have been pretty simplistic drivel. Still, wasn’t it glorious!\n(TAG) You can find more commentaries by Willem Lange at VPR-dot-net."

        "text": "No, Trump can’t pardon himself. The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing “the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.” We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person’s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone’s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant’s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else’s conduct, the justice of someone else’s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution’s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed king would have been spared instead of going to the chopping block.\nWe know of not a single instance of a self-pardon having been recognized as legitimate. Even the pope does not pardon himself. On March 28, 2014, in St. Peter’s Basilica, Pope Francis publicly kneeled before a priest and confessed his sins for about three minutes.\nPresident Trump thinks he can do a lot of things just because he is president. He says that the president can act as if he has no conflicts of interest. He says that he can fire the FBI director for any reason he wants (and he admitted to the most outrageous of reasons in interviews and in discussion with the Russian ambassador). In one sense, Trump is right — he can do all of these things, although there will be legal repercussions if he does. Using official powers for corrupt purposes — such as impeding or obstructing an investigation — can constitute a crime.\nBut there is one thing we know that Trump cannot do — without being a first in all of human history. He cannot pardon himself.\nElizabeth Holtzman: In the Russia probe, could Trump pardon himself?\nDana Milbank: Trump can do whatever he wants. God help us."

(PDS) shareholders and gain control of the bond exchange.\nIn a text message Friday, Landbank president Alex V. Buenaventura said the offer period was moved from the earlier deadline of end-December 2018 as there was “no response so far” from PDS shareholders.\nLast October, Landbank issued a new offer to buy shares at P215 per share, lower than P360 a share previously.\nThe downgraded offer took into account the P600 million in dividends that PDS issued to shareholders in June, even as the share price remained a multiplier of 1.5 times adjusted net asset value or the same as the previous offer.\nThe dividend payouts reduced PDS’s asset value, Buenaventura had noted.\nBuenaventura earlier expressed optimism that a majority or at least 66.67 percent of shareholders would give their acceptance letters to Landbank before yearend to seal the deal and sign share purchase agreements with them.\nDuring the previous offer, 43 percent of shareholders already submitted acceptance letters, such that they expect the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), banks and investment houses to accept the new offer as well, Buenaventura had said.\nBuenaventura’s plan to acquire a majority stake in PDS runs counter to the planned merger of the latter with the PSE.\nBut Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III, who chairs Landbank, had lamented that the PSE was not being compliant with the conditions set for its merger with PDS."

Sandra Williams, Democratic Reps. Janine Boyd and Stephanie Howse, and political consultants.\n“Glad to be in attendance @ rep’s Stephanie Howse and Janine Boyd fundraiser w/Jerry Springer, possible candidate for Gov. of Ohio,” Williams tweeted Tuesday.\n“He’s very serious,” Williams said of Springer’s interest in running, in an interview with Cleveland.com.\nThe fundraiser was held at Nighttown, a Cleveland Heights jazz club and restaurant.\nRing said Springer gave a brief speech at the fundraiser.\nSpringer, 73, previously considered running for US Senate in 2000 and 2004, but decided against it.\nHe has previously attributed the rumors around his potential bid for governor to former reality TV star Donald Trump’s successful White House bid.\nBut people continued to discuss Springer’s potential return to politics.\nIn late May, Business Insider, citing more than half a dozen Democrats familiar with the race, reported influential Ohio Democrats — including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland and Hamilton County Democratic Party Chairman Tim Burke — pushed for Springer to run.\nIn an interview with CNN’s Brooke Baldwin in May of 2016, Springer — who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 — was seemingly unsurprised by Trump’s popularity. He said that since President Ronald Reagan, a generation of Americans has grown up believing government is the problem in America.\n“The celebrity in politics was inevitable,” Springer said.\nSince Trump’s win, a growing number of celebrities have expressed interest in running for office, or have not ruled out pursuing politics in the future.\n“I think it’s a real possibility,” Johnson told the publication when asked if he would ever run.\nIn July, a West Virginia resident created a campaign committee called “Run The Rock 2020” to draft Johnson as a presidential candidate in 2020.\nMusician Kid Rock teased a potential bid for US Senate, but ultimately used the social media hype around the buzz to announce his non-profit designed to promote voter registration."

Six days through November tied for record- high temperatures.\nHowever, Zierden cautioned, just because the average temperatures have been warmer doesn’t mean Florida won’t see cold snaps this winter.\nAcross the country, it’s been an above-average year for temperatures, the report from the National Centers for Environmental Information shows.\nThe year-to-date U.S. average temperature, 56.4 degrees, was the third warmest on record. That’s 2.61 degrees above the 20th century average, according to the NCEI.\nThe warmest year on record for the U.S. was 2012, when the average temperature through November was 57.04 degrees, NCEI archives show.\nSpectrum Bay News 9 Meteorologist Josh Linker said average temperatures will likely remain above average at least through Christmas, but just by a couple of degrees each day. Temperatures, however, return to average for the last few days of the year.\nLinker said December is currently averaging less than 1 degree above normal, due in part to a recent week of cooler weather."

We can confirm that the federation did receive a courtesy call from President Jacob Zuma regarding his decision to reshuffle his cabinet this morning.\nWhile, we acknowledge that the president of the republic has a prerogative to reshuffle his National Executive as per the Constitution of the republic, we find the frequency of these cabinet reshuffles unsettling because they do not help to create the much needed stability at a government level. What compounds the situation is that some of these government departments are also witnessing an exodus of senior technocrats.\nAll of this is happening while workers and the poor are continuing to be victims of a system that has condemned millions of our fellow citizens to lives of brute survival. Our economy is currently haemorrhaging jobs at an alarming rate and it does not help that we are also experiencing this kind of political uncertainty and policy incoherence from government.\nCOSATU expects cabinet reshuffles to be about strengthening the capacity of government in order to help government to better implement its developmental agenda and deliver on its promises. We are not convinced that this reshuffle is informed by that,considering that some of the most ineffectual ministers like Minister Bathabile Dlamini, Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, and Minister Mosebenzi Zwane are still part of the National Executive.\nThese recent cabinet reshuffles have done very little to help take the National Democratic Revolution forward. We call on the African National Congress to reflect deeply about the state of the economy and the overall performance of its government. The majority of workers are facing a bleak future and the people South Africa need a clear sign that the government has a plan to rescue them from poverty and kick-start this economy.\nAs COSATU, we will continue to work with and support the newly elected ministers and deputy ministers with the hope that they will prioritise a people driven and people centred development. We wish them well in their new positions."

        "text": "After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms. When used effectively, a first lady's podium serves as a force for change.\nNatalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Women's Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute and co-author of \"A Role Without a Rulebook: The Influence and Leadership of Global First Ladies.\" She wrote this for InsideSources.com."

And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all them well.\nOver a career of more than 40 years, singer Elvis Costello has been a punk provocateur, a seminal new wave voice, a contemporary pop singer and even a classic crooner. And there have been fans of each of Costello’s career ventures.\nSo how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture – his very strong new disc “Look Now”?\nOn Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc’s 12 songs.\nAnd to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well – not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs.\nPerhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated.\nEither way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016.\nBacked by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with “This Year’s Girl” from his 1978 sophomore disc, “This Year’s Model,” with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound.\nHe followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful “Honey, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,” and “Clubland,” with Costello’s ‘70s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a “Watching the Detectives” affect.\nLater offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc’s new single “Under Lime” had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. “Why Won’t Heaven Help Me” was pretty rocking. The slow guitar-and-piano “Stripping Paper” was a clear reminder or the Elvis of old, and the slow, sensitive “Suspect My Tears” had some of his best vocals of the night, as he reached for a falsetto.\nEarly in the show, the older songs Costello played were nearly all deeper cuts: “New Lace Sleeves” from 1981’s “Trust”; a rocking, new-wavey “(I Don’t Want to Go To) Chelsea,” with good lead guitar.\nSo that when he did play a hit – his 1977 U.S. breakthrough “Watching the Detectives,” (in the same darkened-stage presentation as the last time he was at the Sands) it got a huge crowd reaction – and deservedly so.\nCostello later did the same with later songs: A largely voice-and-acoustic guitar version of 1986’s “Indoor Fireworks” to a big cheer from the crowd, and closed the main set with a faster, more rocking “Can You Hear Me” from his last disc, 2013’s “Wise Up Ghost” that segued right into the hit “Pump It Up,” thumping, urgent and rocking.\nCostello’s encore stretched eight songs and 40 minutes.\nIt opened with one of the night’s best: a barely instrumented, mostly a cappella “Allison,” with his two female backup singers. It got a huge cheer. Then a stark and spare, piano-and-voice “Accidents Will Happen,” on which he reached for a high and powerful end note.\nHe used that same vocal approach on “I Still Have That Other Girl,” which he also wrote with Bacharach, – really singing it --and paired that with a new Bacharach co-write, “He’s Given Me Things,” from the new disc.\nCostello flubbed the start of that song slightly, and after saying “this is the first night,” re-started it dramatically better. He followed that with another early deeper cut, “Green Shirt,” which started stripped, then built as the crowd clapped along.\nAnd then a six-minute version of his 1979 hit “(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace Love and Understanding,” with a wonderful chorus coda.\nThat completed Costello’s journey of giving everyone what they wanted. The fact that he could do that, and do it as well as he did, shows how important Costello’s music has been, and how much he still has left."

        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Fighting in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City killed 23 Iraqis yesterday, hospital officials said, and the U.S. military reported five troop deaths, as April showed signs of becoming the worst month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September.\nAt least 11 of the Iraqi deaths occurred when mortar shells landed in residential neighborhoods. Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.\nOfficials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters.\nThousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said.\nThere were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October.\nHis fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide.\nAlthough U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or \"special groups\" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others.\n\"A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM,\" he told lawmakers in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia.\nCrocker and Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, gave lawmakers their assessments of the war during two days of hearings in Washington that ended yesterday.\nThe surge in troop deaths since the Basra offensive has underscored their contention that security gains witnessed in recent months easily could be reversed. At least 30 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since the Basra operation began, most in Baghdad; at least 19 have died in Iraq so far this month, representing the highest daily average since last September.\nThe deaths announced yesterday brought to at least 4,031 the number of U.S. troops to die in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. Brief military statements said three of the soldiers died in roadside bomb blasts: two in northeastern Baghdad and one east of the city. Two others died of \"non-combat\" injuries, statements said, giving no other details."

Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter.\nSean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California.\nThis is not your typical barbershop.\nAnd that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood.\n\"We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,\" says Heywood.\nMR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops.\n\"We're trying to thrive, not just survive,\" Heywood said.\nMR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network.\nThe two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track.\nAmong other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly.\n\"We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,\" Walker says.\nGiving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago.\n\"All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,\" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago.\nImagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area.\nThat was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921.\nBut on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\nSound off: What challenges do black entrepreneurs face?\niReport.com: How would you make black America better?\n\"People came and said,'Run, they are shooting people,' \" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. \"We evacuated. They were destroying everything.\"\nThe death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials.\nThe riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered.\n\"It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,\" says Walker.\nWess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, \"We would have had a black president before now..... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box.\"\nHis advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it.\n\"Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,\" Young says.\nWalker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him.\n\"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,\" he says. \"I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.\""

        "text": "Two recently published reports shed damning light on the high cost of low wages in the fast food industry – an industry dominated by the restaurant giant McDonald’s, which raked-in over $5.4 billion in profits last year.\nThe reports – Super Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry – argue that low-wages in the fast-food industry cost taxpayers nearly $7 billion annually.\nMedicaid and CHIP (the Children’s Health Insurance Program) account for more than half of the $7 billion, at an average of $3.9 billion annually. Additionally, due to low earnings, fast food workers’ families also receive an annual average of $1.04 billion in food stamp benefits and $1.91 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments.\nThe ten largest fast-food companies alone made more than $7.4 billion in profits in 2012 and paid their top executives more than $53 million in compensation.\nLow-wage fast-food jobs cost tax-payers the most in California ($717 million), New York ($708 million), Texas ($556 million), Illinois ($368 million), and Florida ($348 million).\nAccording to Super Sizing Public Costs, “McDonald’s represents the most costly fast-food company for tax-payers.” Low wages and lack of benefits at McDonald’s cost tax-payers “$1.2 billion every year in public assistance programs,” according to the report.\nYUM! Brands (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC), Subway, Burger King and Wendy’s round-out the top five fast-food companies with workers who rely on public assistance.\nThe median average wage for fast-food workers is $8.69; an estimated 87 percent of fast-food workers do not receive health benefits. Furthermore, 67 percent of front-line fast-food workers are adults 20 and older; 68 percent are the main earners in their families and more than one-quarter are raising children.\n“This business model puts tax-payers on the hook, while rewarding corporate CEO’s,” Jack Temple, a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project and co-author of Super Sizing Public Costs, said during a conference call with the press on October 15.\nThe reports come on the heels of a nation-wide wave of fast-food worker strikes; most recently strikes took place in over 60 cities across the nation with thousands of fast-food workers walking off their jobs.\n“The CEO of McDonald’s makes more in a day than I make in a year,” Yates added.\nFast-food workers nationally are calling for $15 an-hour in pay and the right to form or join a union without retaliation.\nJacobs also addressed the wave of non-traditional worker organizing taking place in fast-food, retail and other low-wage service sector jobs.\nSuper Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill was published by the National Employment Law Project and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry was published by the University of California Labor Center."

This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Spoon mounds of filling on the sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart (the number of mounds you make will depend on the size of the pasta sheets you use). Lightly mist the mounds with a spray mister filled with water, then place a second pasta sheet over the first, covering the filling mounds, and pressing firmly around the edges and between the mounds to seal. Using a fluted cutting wheel or knife, cut between the rows of ravioli. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook until tender, 2-3 minutes. To serve, reheat the browned butter. Drain ravioli and place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with butter, sprinkle with hazelnuts and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Garnish with sage leaves and serve immediately.\nInspired by Williams-Sonoma Seasonal Celebration: Autumn, by Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, 1997)."

She said that since the start of record-keeping in 1937, there has been snowfall in the Wood River Valley on several days in late June, as well as in July and August.\nJan Turzian, owner of Sun Valley Garden Center in Bellevue, said a few of her customers told her they lost tomatoes due to the unexpected cold weather. She said plants that were covered were probably all right. She said it’s the cold temperatures more than snow that damages delicate flowers and vegetables.\nThe Herr brothers, Ed and Nevin, who grow strawberries in Picabo for sale around the Wood River Valley, said their crop was undamaged by the late snow.\n“It’s supposed to be 80 degrees from here on out, so I think we’re OK,” Ed Herr said.\nThe storm was widespread, and was more pronounced farther south in Utah.

O&apos;Donnell predicted they would reach into \"the tens of millions of dollars.\"\nA call seeking comment from Cowell was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\"We have not even been served with the complaint in this matter, and so have no comment,\" said ABC spokeswoman Annie Fort.\nThe suit also names FremantleMedia North America, producer of FOX&apos;s \"American Idol\" and proposed producer of ABC&apos;s \"The Million Dollar Idea.\" (Note the slightly different title.) FremantleMedia does not comment on pending litigation, spokesman Brian Reinert said.\n\"Million Dollar Idea\" first aired on KSTC-TV in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market in 2003. The series was recently syndicated to more than 125 stations nationwide and its creators registered for both copyright and trademark for the show&apos;s name and premise, according to their statement.\nThe show is taped before an audience and judges at the Mall of America. New product inventors and marketers from across the country compete for a prize package to help launch their product and place it for sale with a Mall of America retailer.\nThe syndicated series has received newspaper, magazine and TV coverage, including on NBC&apos;s \"Today\" show, the suit says.\n\"It is incredibly ironic that our show, the premise of which is to promote, protect and reward small-town American ingenuity, was itself the victim of corporate theft and greed,\" Golden said.\nHer partner, Walker, pitched a deal for the show to ABC in early 2004 and provided copies of their presentation to CAA, according to the suit. That&apos;s the same agency identified in a recent ABC press release as having \"packaged\" \"The Million Dollar Idea\" with Cowell.\nBesides the alleged theft of the title, every major concept connected to the show also was copied, the suit claims.\nIn the July 13 news release announcing \"The Million Dollar Idea,\" ABC described the series as \"a nationwide search for America&apos;s greatest entrepreneur with the best business idea or new product,\" with the prize to be $1 million \"worth of business support,\" including cash and other resources.\nThe idea was conceived by Cowell and British entrepreneur Peter Jones, according to the ABC release."

        "text": "Are stoners now a target advertising demographic for fast food companies?\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast-food companies have become increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.\nJuly 31, 2012, 1:48 a.m.\nBetween Taco Bell's \"Fourthmeal\" advertisements and Jack in the Box commercials featuring slow-talking stoners, it's hardly a secret anymore that fast-food companies are shamelessly targeting potheads with their ads. But have they crossed a line?\nOnce considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious.\nTake, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the \"late-night munchies.\" Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology.\n\"If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language,\" said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. \"One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned.\"\nIt's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product.\nOf course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose.\nWhether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its \"late-night munchies\" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin.\nSo long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic.\n\"A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo,\" said Yohn. \"They think it's more effective to be overt. It creates more buzz. I think that's why you see a lot of advertising that seems unapologetically targeted to pot smokers.\"\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast food companies seem increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements."

Another survey published by the European Commission indicated that 38 per cent of Britons speak a foreign language."

Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.\nThat transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue — one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts — what Ms. Rowe called “our crowd sourcing” — were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly’s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly’s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal — Postmedieval — to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. “Serious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy — as they have existed for decades, even centuries — aren’t becoming obsolete,” he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week — the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. “We have never done it that way before,” should be academia’s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book “Planned Obsolescence” on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an “American Idol”-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history — a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n“Knowledge is not democratic,” said Michèle Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, “How Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.” Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now “entirely won over by the open peer review model.” The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvocates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control — for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly — are given short shrift under the current system.\n“There is an ethical imperative to share information,” said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it. Engaging people in different disciplines and from outside academia has made his scholarship better, he said."

        "text": "Adweek: So what’s a digital-media tyro like you doing at a fusty old-media company like CBS?\nJim Lanzone: I don’t really think of it that way at all. People think the Internet will supercede TV, but it’s really been more additive than anything else, largely because it’s so portable. It’s not taking anything away from linear television; if anything, it’s encouraged people to spend even more time watching video.\nAW: The fact that we can watch TV on a telephone: is this doing something insidious to the parts of our brain that process narrative?\nJL: Think about the very early days of TV—the first shows were structured just like radio broadcasts or Broadway shows. You start with the familiar and you expand from there. Creative people haven’t taken advantage of the new media platforms; we’re still in this brackish time between two eras.\nAW: You still watch TV?\nJL: I’m a binge watcher. I have DirecTV, so I have a ton of shows on the DVR: The Daily Show, [Real Time With] Bill Maher, SNL. I’ve been watching How I Met Your Mother for six years. There are definitely more shows out there that I want to watch that I don’t have time to watch, which I suppose is a great sign of where programming is headed.\nAW: Why did CBS issue a fatwa against Hulu?\nAW: Can you write code?\nJL: I never got into programming when I was a kid. I was too busy playing Pitfall and Kaboom! on Atari to write code. But then again, I don’t think Les Moonves knows how to make a television set either.\nAW: So there’s no disconnect between the old media centers—New York, L.A.—and Silicon Valley?\nJL: Well, you’re looking at it from a geographic standpoint and that really isn’t relevant any longer. I think Silicon Valley is the third leg of the media stool; I mean, there’s a reason why all the animated features are made in Silicon Valley now. Engineers are the new artists of this generation of media.\nAW: Are you from Silicon Valley?\nJL: I grew up in San Carlos, where Oracle now stands. In fact, they built Oracle on the old Marine World site. George Lucas used some of the elephants from Marine World in Star Wars, and after it came out—I must have seen it 25 times that summer—they started offering Bantha rides at Marine World.\nAW: Speaking of which, what the hell happened to George Lucas? Those three Star Wars prequels were just god-awful.\nJL: I know what happened to George Lucas: the ‘80s. If movies peaked in the ‘70s, then it’s fair to say that the 2000s is the Renaissance period for TV. The new Battlestar [Galactica] was at least a thousand times better than the old one. And I almost didn’t watch it at first because I was afraid it was going to ruin my childhood memories of the original."

The March incident cost him a two-game suspension, but when TMZ released the video showing the act, the Ravens terminated his contract and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.\nToday I captured the seriousness of domestic violence. The report from the Violence Policy Center shows that South Carolina is ranked the second worst state in the nation for violence against women. The report notes that 50 women were killed in 2012. Spartanburg County had four in 2012. The county has seen two husband-on-wife homicides so far this year and DV cases are some of the most common ones among daily incident reports here. Local leaders tell me it is a significant combination of problems that all need to be dealt with in order to change the status quo surrounding violence against women. Much of it starts with a serious culture change, they tell me.\nI was baffled when a colleague of mine pointed out the Fox News morning show “Fox & Friends.” The anchors on the program somehow find a way to joke about Ray Rice knocking out his now-wife and dragging her limp body out of the elevator.\n“I think the message is take the stairs,” one anchor quips.\nWe got right to the point during an interview today with the victim services director at SAFE Homes, a domestic violence shelter and coalition in Spartanburg County.\nThe gist of the interview was to hold people accountable for their actions and for society to never turn a blind eye.\nMy full story on the violence against women ranking in South Carolina is at goupstate.com and in Tuesday’s Spartanburg Herald-Journal."

        "text": "Meet Google's Robot Army. It's Growing.\nGoogle can't stop buying robotics companies. In the past two months, eight of the 12 companies the search giant has acquired have \"robotics\" in their name or descriptions. Here's your complete breakdown of the robot army presently at Google's command.\nAs stated in the midst of its buying spree, the company's largely letting its new robotics divisions continue to work on their preexisting projects, and why wouldn't they? The newly acquired companies are doing a damn good job. They're even winning competitions.\nRobot technology would help with self-driving cars, certainly, but the range of these acquisitions hints at even broader ambitions. Again, we don't know much. They're all a part of the Google X division, which is top secret by definition. We do know what the new companies in the Google family are up to, though, and that might offer us some clues.\nThese guys are rockstars. The Japanese team that got its start at Tokyo University just took the top prize at DARPA's Robotics Challenge Trial thanks to the cunning and agility of its 5-foot, 5-inch, 209-pound bipedal robot. After being purchased by Google in early December 2013, Schaft's blue machine proved to be the best at walking on uneven terrain, climbing ladders, clearing debris, and connecting hoses, ultimately scoring an impressive 27 out of 32 possible points.\nThe company was originally founded to build disaster response robots after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 but has since broadened its scope, thanks in part to funding from the U.S. government. Who knows how far they'll go floating on Google's coffers?\nIndustrial Perceptions, Inc., is an imaging company that spun off of the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage. Before being acquired by Google in December—the day after the Schaft acquisition, in fact—IPI was focusing on building advanced technology for 3D vision-guided robots to be used in manufacturing and logistics. This includes the ability to see and sort different objects, say, in a factory. You could imagine a company like Amazon being very interested in this kind of technology, but it's so far unclear exactly what Google wants to do with it.\nRedwood Robotics started as a joint venture between Meka Robotics, SRI International, and Willow Garage, IPI's parent. And like IPI, it's always had a very focused mission. Redwood wants to build the \"next generation arm\" for robots. Meka Robotics founder Aaron Edsinger once said that he wants to do for robotic arms what the Apple II did for computers. Specifically, Redwood wants to build robotic arms that can work alongside people even in the comfort of their own home. That also means being the common arm manufacturer of service robots, so in the future, everybody's personal robot could have Redwood arms. Well, make that Google arms.\nLike its cousin, Redwood Robotics, Meka is dedicated to building robots that can live and work with human beings. The company describes its flagship model, the M1 Mobile Manipulator, as having \"human-safe, human-soft, and human scale robot technologies that will enable the robots of tomorrow to work alongside people in the home and the workplace.\" The human-like faces on the robot can even emote, a feature that's as creepy as you let it be.\nEven before joining Google, Holomini was a pretty secretive outfit. All we really know from its now shuttered website is the company describes itself as \"Creators of high-tech wheels for omnidirectional motion.\" The image above is just a stock photo guesstimate of what a \"high-tech wheel for omnidirectional motion\" might look like.\nIf Redwood and IPI are the engineers in the family, Bot & Dolly are the artists. The company describes itself as \"a design and engineering studio that specializes in automation, robotics, and filmmaking\" with a mission \"to advance motion control and automation as a creative medium.\" In reality, this means that Bot and & Dolly use robots to help film commercials and movies like Gravity. This doesn't mean that Google wants to get into the movie business, but hey, if a robot's good enough to make a movie, what else can it do?\nBoston Dynamics is the real celebrity of the bunch. After acquiring six robotics companies in six days, Google took a couple of days off before announcing this major acquisition. The company is known for building all kinds of futuristic bots from the bipedal, humanoid robot Atlas (above) to the impossibly fast, four-legged Cheetah. Actually, Boston Dynamics brings a whole robot army to Google, one that the military is very eager to recruit.\nGoogle's latest purchase is less interested in building an actual robot than in designing an intelligent robot brain. The self-described \"cutting edge artificial intelligence company\" that uses \"the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms: comes with a team of 75 researchers and software engineers whose talents could be put to use on anything from the hypothetical Googlebot to the company's flagship search engine and anything in between. Because after all, robots are just another step in Google becoming the company that is everywhere, and does everything."

        "text": "Thorpe of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association says the decision to raise penalties won’t solve the parking crisis.\nFor more than a decade, Ken Thorpe has been a soldier in the fight against parking tickets, which has become part of the escalating war for access to the curb. It's a conflict that has intensified in recent years as ride-hail services have clogged roads, New Yorkers have had more of their purchases delivered, and the streetscape has been remade with bicycle lanes, pedestrian malls and restrictions on parking and unloading.\nThe city \"has whittled away at the commercial parking infrastructure,\" said Thorpe, the chief executive of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association, which he founded in 2004 to deal with parking issues for small and midsize businesses.\nAt the same time, trucks are making more deliveries than ever, and they must do that regardless of whether there's unloading space available. \"Trucking is not a'choice' situation,\" Thorpe said. \"It's a necessity.\"\nBut now the 600 members of his group, as well as large fleet operators such as UPS and FedEx, are facing higher fines—and possibly more paperwork and time in traffic court—as a little-known yet controversial city policy comes under fire. The stipulated-fine program was established in 2004 by the Department of Finance to let businesses pay slightly reduced fines—and no fines at all for some infractions—in exchange for not contesting their tickets.\nIt was mainly a way to reduce everyone's administrative costs while having delivery companies pay roughly what they would have otherwise. (The reductions were calculated with an eye on the percentage of tickets that were successfully challenged.) But the program was a sore point with advocacy groups such as Transportation Alternatives, which considered it a corporate giveaway that neutered traffic enforcement.\nLast month, in a bid at leveling the playing field for businesses not in the program—and furthering the city's congestion-reduction goals—the Finance Department announced that next month it would raise the program's fines, including those now set at zero.\nAs if that were not bad enough for Thorpe's membership, in the same week five City Council members introduced a bill to abolish the program. They denounced it as a free pass to large corporations and a contributor to reckless parking and congestion.\nThorpe says it's the council bill that's a giveaway—to parking-ticket brokers, who stand to gain business adjudicating tickets. He sees no way that the Finance Department's plan will change driver behavior or have any impact on congestion.\n\"The theory of the program was there are bad things, good things and some things in between, and it taught the driver you're going to pay a lot to do bad things and little or none to do the others,\" Thorpe said. \"Now they've put the bad and good closer together, removing the driver's incentive for doing the good, because it's going to cost just a little more to do the bad.\"\nIn fact, good and bad parking behavior will not be punished that similarly. The most serious violations that get discounts, such as obstructing traffic ($10 off the $115 total), will now get no break at all, while many of the zero-fine infractions will cost $25.\nBut Thorpe says those increases could cost some of his members hundreds of dollars a week—enough that he would consider taking them out of the program. The $35 fine for double parking outside Midtown is still better than the official $115, but he notes that double parking is legal for the first 30 minutes, and enforcement is not always scrupulous.\nIn 2011 he sued the city, which for some years had been slapping double-parked delivery trucks with the more expensive violation of blocking a travel lane, which carried a $40 fine. In 2016 the city settled and paid those covered by the lawsuit $14 million.\nEven so, the Finance Department, which worked with the Department of Transportation on the new fine schedule, says more needs to be done to ease congestion. The agency says the stipulated-fine program has been sending the wrong signal to the wider parking universe by not reflecting the fact that not all double-parking tickets are dismissed.\n\"We need the program to have incentives that are aligned with the city's goals to reduce congestion, and we need the program to be fair,\" said Finance Deputy Commissioner Jeffrey Shear. \"We agree that the conversation about congestion is a larger conversation, and there are many other factors, and this program is one small piece. But we don't want to send the wrong message by saying double parking outside of Midtown will cost businesses nothing.\"\nThe Transportation Department maintains that it is doing all it can.\nThe agency is \"committed to improving commercial accessibility throughout the five boroughs, especially in the context of our street-improvement projects,\" a spokeswoman said. As part of those projects, \"new curb regulations are installed that are complementary to the larger curb-management goals of the corridor, such as faster bus mobility, reduction of double parking, and better commercial access.\"\nBut the Transportation Department is aware that it's a long way from curing congestion when demand for deliveries from myriad e-commerce businesses, including Amazon and Fresh Direct, is bigger than ever.\n\"Consumer demands and the amount of available space we have at the curb, they're at odds right now,\" Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said at a Crain's breakfast forum last month. She added that parking enforcement can only do so much, and larger fixes, including congestion pricing and technology such as license-plate readers, might be part of the answer.\n\"Right now the demand for the curb exceeds the supply,\" she said.\nSome members of the City Council are not convinced that higher fines will make the program more effective. They say any solution will include abolishing stipulated fines.\n\"This program doesn't work,\" said Costa Constantinides, a City Council member from Queens, who introduced the bill to end the program as one of several parking and transportation proposals. \"Trucks are still parking in bike lanes. It's been around for years, and I really feel it's prohibiting us from having a real conversation around parking that we desperately need to have.\"\nAs part of that conversation, the councilman introduced a bill that would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which oversees city agencies, to have buildings under its jurisdiction receive deliveries between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\"The city should lead by example,\" Constantinides said.\nThat's not so simple, it turns out. A Transportation Department off-hours delivery program proved unworkable for many businesses, some of which had to add employees to accept the shipments. The councilman said his program would be \"one part of the puzzle.\"\nAs it happens, parking-ticket broker Glen Bolofsky has contributed more than $4,000 to Constantinides' campaign treasury in the past five years. A spokesman for the councilman dismissed the idea that the bill was intended to help brokers.\n\"The majority of those that benefit from this [stipulated-fine] program are big-box delivery corporations who flout traffic laws at the expense of pedestrians, cyclists and drivers,\" the spokesman said.\nBolofsky agreed that ending the program would help brokers, but he insisted the biggest beneficiary would be the public. \"Congestion will be reduced,\" he said. \"More money will be raised.\"\nAssuming 70% of double-parking tickets are dismissed, he estimated the city has forfeited $147.5 million over the life of the program by not fining participants for double parking beyond Midtown.\nThe new schedule will collect about 30% of double-parking fines, but Bolofsky insists the program still benefits the biggest operators the most. He maintains that neither the city nor companies such as UPS will lose money adjudicating tickets, arguing that many companies still have in-house teams for the job, and automation can reduce the expense further. He noted that the city handled 12 million tickets a year in 1990, when they were handwritten, and had to deal with only 10 million last year. Enforcement agents now use handheld devices that reduce the errors and bad handwriting that led to dismissals.\nThe Finance Department disagrees with his conclusions, saying both the city and the 1,751 companies in the program—encompassing 48,880 vehicles—would spend more without the program.\n\"We would need more hearing officers,\" Shear said. \"The companies would have to retain brokers or hire staff to defend against these parking tickets. In terms of revenue, there would be no increase to the city.\"\nApart from whether the program is good for the city, a walk through Midtown with several UPS executives revealed how difficult following parking rules can be.\nAnother option would be to park at a metered spot a couple of blocks away and cart diamonds by hand truck to recipients, which UPS rules out for security reasons. \"It would put our driver and other people in the area at risk,\" said Axel Carrion, director of state public affairs.\nA few blocks away, on West 50th Street, where commercial parking was allowed at that hour, every space between Sixth and Seventh avenues was taken, mostly by delivery and commercial vehicles. There were two idling for-hire vehicles and three cars with \"parking authorization\" placards—the bane of parking-reform advocates—on their dashboard.\nEven when a UPS driver finds a legal spot, regulations can conflict with the company's efforts to operate efficiently. Using new dispatch-planning technology, the company has increased the number of packages a truck will carry to nearly 400 so that one truck does the work of two. But that truck needs to stay in one place much of the workday, doing pickups when it's done with deliveries. Parking rules—which aim to promote the flow of traffic and keep operators from hogging spots—require it to move after three hours.\nBut circling the block will delay deliveries and the truck could lose the spot, so the driver will stay put. This reduces congestion and pollution. But the ticket, which costs program participants nothing, will set them back $25 under the new schedule.\nOverall UPS expects its payments under the fine program to jump 32% next year, to $21.8 million, with a $3.4 million increase from double parking and more than $1 million from unloading in the wrong spot or at the wrong time. The company says it would like to try other solutions, such as paying for spots where a truck could sit all day. Long term, it would like to see new building construction include space for unloading.\nRight now the firm is weighing the benefits of staying in the program.\n\"My drivers can be trained to avoid the ticket, and we have drastically reduced the amount of tickets over the past couple of years,\" said Dan Byrnes, director of finance at UPS, adding that the city's ticket data aided his efforts. \"Now with these changes, [the city] is not really helping. Just raising prices is not going to change behavior.\""

        "text": "On April 4, 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft. The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world, and also bag the title for one of the most valuable companies.\nToday, there is a little bit of Microsoft in everybody’s life. Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft’s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company’s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available. Maybe you are into gaming and own an Xbox One, or your company relies on Azure cloud services.\nIn the last 40 years, Microsoft -- which once used to sell program language interpreters -- has expanded into several categories, and now makes full-fledged operating systems for not just desktop computers, but smartphones, gaming consoles, servers, as well as Internet of Things devices. Surface tablets and Xbox consoles show the company’s side interest in developing its own hardware modules.\n\"Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution\", Gates wrote in an email sent to all Microsoft employees yesterday.\n\"In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices\", Gates noted.\n\"Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way\".\nAnd this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn’t released until 2010. By this time, iPhone had showed its dominance in the world, and Google was upping the ante with Android. Windows Phone is still struggling to gain any substantial market share. The mobile platform still has a wide \"app-gap\" problem, though the company seems to have found a couple of ways to fix it.\nBut one of the most exciting things that happened in the company was its decision to open up. Under Nadella, Microsoft finally accepted that it doesn’t have a significant user base in smartphones. The company realized that if it didn't open up to rival platforms, it would miss out on a lot of users. And that’s one of the first things Nadella did after taking the charge of the company. Microsoft launched Office on iOS. Until then Office was only available on Windows, Windows RT, and Windows Phone, and a half-baked mobile version on Android.\nThe move received an overwhelming response from users, resulting in Office apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- top the app chart in within 24 hours of their release on the platform. Late last year, the company made premium access to the Office suite free on iOS and Android. Office for iOS was in the works at Microsoft for a long time, but Ballmer used to prioritize its products on Windows devices first. Nadella evidently changed that.\n\"We have accomplished a lot together during our first 40 years and empowered countless businesses and people to realize their full potential. But what matters most now is what we do next\", Gates writes in his email. Microsoft does have a lot of things to look forward to in the coming months and years. Later this year, Microsoft will release Windows 10 for desktop computers, as well as smartphones, IoT devices and Xbox One. In the coming months, Microsoft will also release the next iteration of its productivity suite, Office 2016. For the first time, the company is simultaneously releasing Office on OS X and Windows.\nAdditionally, Microsoft has showcased a number of products that could change the way we compute and interact with technology. Its augmented reality headset HoloLens is just one example. It will be interesting to see what the company does next and how things work out for it in the coming years."

        "text": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy — a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren’t entirely bad, of course, and they’re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we’ll want to go next or what songs we’ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they’re interested in. As with similarly devised services — LinkedIn’s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph — the new feature’s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we’re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there’s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data — personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it — these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they’re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data’s George Washington?\nThis is why I’m so excited about Tableau’s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau’s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I’ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound — it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) — but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it’s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today’s free users will be tomorrow’s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company’s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That’s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick – appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe’re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible – and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that’s missing from what I can see is the education – knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution – but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the ‘how’ to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I’m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who’s got that vision, I’d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we’re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a “search engine for data” that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I’ve worked at, I’ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: “a historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite”. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these “shadow IT” projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we’ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks.\nThanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that’s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic."

        "text": "Two Democratic state representatives from South Florida said Thursday that they've gathered with 33 colleagues to file paperwork with the Secretary of State to poll lawmakers for their support for a special session.\nAt the end of session, superintendents and the statewide teachers' union called for the Legislature to redo their education funding in the budget they were about to pass. When a special session seemed imminent on gambling issues, again, they made the same call, without success.\nNow, Democrats have organized a last-ditch effort to use an obscure state law to poll lawmakers on their willingness to come back for a special session to address education funding.\nState Reps. Shevrin Jones of West Park and Nicholas Duran of Miami said Thursday that they and 33 others have filed petitions with the Florida Secretary of State for the poll. This method of calling a special session circumvents the Republican Legislative leadership, who typically are the ones who must call any special sessions and declare its purpose.\nBoth Jones and Duran hail from the two counties, Broward and Miami-Dade, hit hardest by a change in the way the state calculates school funding this year, designed to direct more dollars to smaller districts. They, like the rest of the House members who aren't termed out, are up for re-election.\n\"In the aftermath of Parkland and the waning days of session, the Legislature took action for the safety of our schools,\" Duran said. \"In our rush to do something we didn't account for the conesequences of that bill 7026 and now the school districts are facing those consequences.\"\nSince the passage of this year's budget as well as SB 7026, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, school districts have been scrambling to comply with the new safety requirements as well as their normal operations. Several are considering raising local property taxes.\nDemocrats tried the same tactic after the Pulse shooting in the summer of 2016, in an effort to force a special session vote on guns. They failed to garner enough support to call the session.\nThis year's final vote on the budget was taken on March 11, the Sunday after the legislative session was supposed to end but it went into overtime after the Feb. 14 Parkland shooting changed the entire direction of the session and caused lawmakers to reconcile with issues like school safety and gun rights not previously taking center stage.\nJones was not present for the vote on the budget. He said it was because after the Legislature's official end date he needed to go back to his full-time job as the executive director of the Florida Reading Corps, a branch of AmeriCorps. Duran voted yes, along with many other Democrats who argued against the budget but who ultimately voted for it.\n\"When our members were presented with the budget, they were presented with something they did not like,\" Jones said. \"But (some are) going to vote for it because there are some good things in there.\"\nDespite the fact that Republicans have said repeatedly that they are proud of the investment they made this year in education, Jones said this poll at the very least will require every lawmaker to go on the record in an election year with their position on the current school funding levels.\nIt's unlikely the Democrats will succeed, but now that the Secretary of State has received Jones and Duran's petition, that office will send out the poll today. Lawmakers will have until noon on May 24 to respond, according to Sarah Revell from the Secretary of State's office."

Sickinger had a strap he planned to use to bridle the horse, but he said better judgment took over and he decided the horse was too wild to control even if he could wrangle it.\nSickinger told a St. Clair County sheriff’s deputy the horse might belong to a neighbor. There are several horse farms in the area, but none came forward as the owner, Sickinger said.\nMoments after Sickinger started petting the horse, a truck drove by and the horse followed after it. No one would see the horse until more than a week later.\nOn Wednesday, area resident Aranza Lee spotted the horse in a soybean field near Imbs Station and Wagner roads, less than a mile from Sickinger’s home. She captured a video of the horse running freely through the field and shared it to the Millstadt News Facebook page. By Thursday afternoon, the post had more than 400 shares, but no one had come forward as the owner.\n“I mean, how weird is that?” said Sara Yoch of Smithton, a self-described horse-lover.\nLt. Alan Haake of the St. Clair County Sheriff’s Department said the department has received several reports over the past three weeks about the missing horse, but he said no one has come forward as the owner, nor has anyone been able to catch it.\nYoch was out at the intersection of Otten and Wagner roads Thursday afternoon with a bucket of feed and a lead, looking for the horse. She said she was out in the same area Wednesday for about four hours, but didn’t have any luck.\nShe warned area residents to avoid approaching the horse if they aren’t familiar with how horses behave, and to slow down when driving through the area. Yoch said a horse standing in a road on a dark night can cause serious damage to a vehicle and hurt the driver, as well as the horse, of course.\nIt’s possible the horse was dumped, according to Stephanie Goepfert, a member of the Lincoln Trail Riders in O’Fallon. It can easily cost more than $500 a month to care for a horse, Goepfert said, and it’s possible the owner could not afford to keep it.\nOn its own, the horse could get sick or injured, Goepfert added.\n“They can survive for a period of time in the wilderness, but if they’re a domesticated animal, they’re relying on a certain diet. It can be bad for them,” Goepfert said.\nThey can survive for a period of time in the wilderness, but if they’re a domesticated animal, they’re relying on a certain diet. It can be bad for them.\nThe most recent sign of the horse was a bedded-down area next to a creek near where the horse was spotted on Tuesday, Lee said.\nThere was no sign of the horse as of Thursday afternoon, though several groups were planning to head out and search for it.\nAnyone who spots the horse can call the St. Clair County Sheriff’s Department at 618-207-4374."

She sat down recently to talk about language barriers, cabin fever and readjusting to life in east Sacramento.\nQ: Between orphanage work in Zimbabwe and Guatemala and clinic work in Bolivia, you’re no stranger to long flights. How did that come about?\nA: I’ve always enjoyed traveling, and then once I became a nurse, to be able to use that career overseas was really neat to me. What intrigued me about Mercy Ships is it’s a fully run hospital – you have a lot of equipment, you have a lot of medications. It’s a lot of what I get to do here, over there.\nI am a Christian, and I think a lot of it has to do with seeing how God’s heart breaks when people are broken and poor. So much that you see is diseases of poverty.\nQ: In August, you were scheduled to join a Mercy Ships crew in Benin in West Africa, but the service was canceled due to a possible Ebola case. Months later, your own hospital became a designated Ebola treatment center, and you took part in the preparedness efforts. Would you have considered going overseas to provide care during the outbreak if given the chance?\nA: Had I been signed up with an Ebola team, I wouldn’t have been opposed. I enjoy the risk. I think that’s part of why I became a nurse, because there’s always those risks out there. When that came up, I decided to not be scared and to take more education and learn more about Ebola. For me, it was just a decision of, I’m a nurse, and I have risks even at UC Davis in Sacramento, and that’s why we learn to protect ourselves.\nQ: You said you had a much heavier patient load and more limited resources on the ship than you do in Sacramento. What did you learn on this trip that you’ll bring back to UCD?\nA: In the ward, there were 15 patients at a time with five nurses and five translators. There were people on the guitar and singing, and kids running around. It was a very different environment for me. I had to calculate my antibiotics and draw them up and mix them. It was just a stretch for me as a nurse, to need to focus on something, but also learn an art of nursing where I am appreciating and valuing the relationships of the Malagasy people..... Just challenging my mind to see that I can function differently, and to bring that back to the burn unit is huge.\nQ: Working in the oral and facial ward, you said you saw a lot of patients with physical obstructions that had long been neglected, such as large dental tumors or cleft palates. What is life like for them after surgery?\nA: When you have a pimple and it feels like the end of the world, imagine missing a nose or having a tumor that’s out to there (gestures to a point several inches from her face). A lot of our patients lose their families, or their spouses will leave them. They are outcasts from society, so this gives them confidence. It brings them a huge healing, not just the physical aspect but their soul as well..... When they have that healing, they finally feel like they can enter society again.\nQ: Even on top of the jet lag, you must have a lot going on right now. How do you readjust to your old life?\nA: I’ve done the reverse culture shock thing before, of coming to the U.S. and feeling like this is crazy. For me, it’s always reminding myself that these are two beautiful cultures that are different. There are good things about both of them. For me, knowing that God is present in both and working in both helps. But I never want to forget what I see."

However, U.S. District Judge Richard Posner said he would \"delay entry of judgment until I have prepared a full opinion, because in the course of that preparation, I may change my mind.\"\nIn his brief filing yesterday, however, Posner said Apple has already admitted that it cannot prove damages on two of the four patents it is using against Motorola. On the two remaining patents, Posner said yesterday that he does not think Apple will prevail.\nBoth companies think damages are an adequate remedy for the alleged infringements, \"though they failed to present evidence on damages strong enough to withstand summary judgment,\" Posner wrote. Since \"injunctive relief would impose costs disproportionate to the harm to the patentee and the benefit of the alleged infringement to the allowed infringer and would be contrary to the public interest, I cannot find a basis for an aware of injunctive relief,\" he said.\nApple requested a full evidentiary hearing on the matter, but Posner said the \"existing evidentiary record is adequate.\"\nMotorola did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAs patent blogger Florian Mueller noted, the case will likely now head to the Federal Circuit.\nThe decision comes several days after Posner dismissed one of two patents Motorola was trying to assert against Cupertino in the same case."

Corinne Kisner, deputy director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, called the expense of installing and maintaining vehicle-to-everything technology a major concern. Many municipalities struggle to fill their potholes, let alone install smart city technology. She also described any effort to require a pedestrian to carry a smartphone to guarantee safety as a dangerous paradigm shift.\n\"It's an unreasonable burden to ask or require people walking in their streets and cities and in front of their homes to carry a signal transmitting device,\" Kisner said. \"The burden needs to be on the driver of the two-ton vehicle, whether it's a human or autonomous technology.\"\nFord sees things differently. Butler described to CNN Business the example of a pedestrian walking on a dirt road who might be identified by a car with C-V2X because they were carrying a smartphone. Traditionally, a driver would rely on their headlights to see the pedestrian. But Butler stops short of expecting smartphones to be recommended or required for pedestrians.\n\"It's like the question of will people be permitted to drive once autonomous vehicles become prevalent,\" Butler said. \"That's something we can only speculate about.\"\nFord isn't the first company to explore outfitting pedestrians with sensors. Siemens, the German conglomerate, began a US Department of Transportation pilot test in Tampa, Florida, last year using pedestrians' smartphones to communicate their location to vehicles. But Siemens officials found the smartphone location data to be so inaccurate that it wasn't useful.\nThe pilot was reworked to focus on outfitting 1,000 vehicles with sensors, and notifying drivers of nearby vehicles with audio alerts, according to Dave Miller, the head of connected vehicles at Siemens.\nBicycling advocates also argued it was unrealistic to require someone to carry a phone on roads.\n\"We think the way things are headed, what we need is more smart sensors [built] in the roadway, or infrastructure,\" Miller told CNN Business.\nThis is something Ford wants, too. It sees the coming arrival of 5G networks -- the next-generation of internet speed -- as a chance to install vehicle-to-everything technology throughout cities.\n\"We think there's an opportunity for a win-win that helps offset to a significant degree the cost a city might have to otherwise undertake to deploy this infrastructure,\" Butler said.\nFord is urging other automakers to install C-V2X in their vehicles.\nBut there's a long road ahead for Ford to make C-V2X as widespread as the traffic light, which took decades to be popularized."

Turns out it was also based on a falsehood.\nThe expletive-filled advertisement President Donald Trump released this week, seemingly to raise fears about immigration in advance of the midterm elections, was widely denounced, with Democrats and even some Republicans criticizing it as racist.\nBut, beyond the outrage, the ad was also reportedly based on a falsehood.\nThe 53-second video focuses on the courtroom behavior of Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing two sheriff's deputies in California in 2014 and bragged about it during the trial.\n\"Democrats let him into our country,\" the ad's script reads. \"Democrats let him stay.\"\nJust one problem: It doesn't appear to be true.\nBracamontes, who had been deported multiple times before his crime spree, last entered the country while George W.

He was later pardoned by Trump.\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff's Office did not respond to a request for comment.\nBracamontes had been deported under both Democratic and Republican presidencies.\nHe was first arrested on charges related to marijuana possession in Phoenix in 1996 and sentenced to four months in jail, the Bee reported. He served his time and was deported in 1997, when Bill Clinton was president, only to be deported again in 2001 soon after being arrested on marijuana charges, according to the Bee.\nBracamontes has been sentenced to the death penalty in the murder case."

That is, those are the amount you'd be paid if you chose an annuity, doled out over 29 years.

But those numbers aren't splayed across billboards and shown in countless mini marts across America.\nThe dismal odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot — 1 in 302.5 million — mean there are 302.5 million potential number combinations, or a little less than one combination for each of the 328 million people living in the U.S. For last Friday's drawing, about 59 per cent of possible combinations were taken. But by Tuesday night's drawing, officials estimate that 75 per cent will be sold.\nThat would mean a 25 per cent chance of no winner. If that happens, it's likely even more combinations would be covered before the next drawing three days later. Officials don't have an estimate on how many tickets would be sold for that potential drawing, and they haven't said how large the estimated prize would be. Could it reach $2 billion?\nThe odds of winning Powerball are 1 in 292.2 million.\nThe odds of winning don't change as jackpots get larger, but the chance that more than one winner will share the prize do. When so many people rush to play as a jackpot soars, the chances increase that two or three tickets — of the millions of tickets sold — will match. Of the five largest jackpots awarded in the U.S., three went to multiple winners. The largest single prize went to a 2017 player from Massachusetts who celebrated a $758.7 million Powerball payday.\nIf the odds of winning either Mega Millions or Powerball don't seem gigantic enough, how about winning them both? Spend $4 on a ticket for each game and it could happen. But the odds aren't especially favourable, at about 1 in 88 quadrillion (that's 88,000,000,000,000,000).\nFor Mega Millions, players choose six numbers: five from a range of white balls, numbered 1 to 70, and one number for the Mega Ball, with a range of 1 to 25. What numbers have come up most? Since 2010, that honour goes to the number 2, with 92 hits, followed by the numbers 20, 11, 31 and 17. The most hit Mega Ball number is 9.\nLottery officials are quick to point out that the number selection is random, so there's no reason that what hit in the past will be selected again. The game also has changed over the years, so some numbers included weren't always in the mix.\nNot surprisingly, the most Mega Million jackpot winners in the past five years have come from states with the largest populations. New York, with the nation's fourth-largest population, leads with seven winners. The No. 1 population state of California is second in Mega Millions winners with six, while Illinois is third with four winners.\nStill, there are some quirks, as Georgia has the eight-largest population and three winners and Washington state has two winners but only the 13th largest population. Texas has the nation's second-largest population, yet players have only bought winning Mega Millions tickets in the state twice in the past five years. And let's hear it for Rhode Island, the smallest population state to have won a Mega Millions jackpot in the past five years.\nFor those with an international bent, the current Mega Millions jackpot has surpassed all lottery jackpot records — so it's not only the largest lottery prize in U.S. history, it's now the world's largest.\nThe annual El Gordo national lottery in Spain advertises a larger total prize pool, but the money is divvied up into many prizes, according to Seth Elkin, a spokesman for the Maryland lottery, which currently takes questions about the Mega Millions drawing."

        "text": "MidMichigan Health plans to restructure and re-align its work force in the coming months, and the changes could mean laying off as many as 1 percent of the company's nearly 5,000 workers.\nMidMichigan Health is the parent company of MidMichigan Medical Center-Midland as well as Medical Centers in Clare, Gladwin and Alma. The company also owns other health care facilities including home health care and nursing homes.\nIn a news release, the company said the restructuring is needed because of changes in the way health care is provided, the economy and health reform. These factors are affecting health care organizations in Michigan and nationwide, the news release stated.\nThe health system has a work force of 4,831. Officials will not know the number of employees who could lose their jobs until the restructuring is completed in mid-May. But it is expected to be less than 1 percent of all employees.\nCompany officials said these changes are happening just as demand for health care services is increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. Growing areas include physician practices, emergency services and critical care. In the past nine months, MidMichigan has added 50 new physicians and what the company calls mid-level providers. New positions include primary-care providers, specialists and a new critical care team.\n\"MidMichigan's vision is to be an integrated health system, and we have been working toward that vision for more than three years,\" said Richard M. Reynolds, president of MidMichigan Health. \"With changes in the health care environment and declining reimbursement we are challenged to shift our resources and realign our employees to continue to provide excellent clinical quality and excellent patient experiences in a safe environment. Doing that means that we have to change and re-tool how we do things.\"\nDeveloping new physician practices requires clinical and support staff. As a result, MidMichigan Health plans to take staff members from under-utilized areas and put them in open positions. Some people could lose their jobs, the company said, because they cannot be redeployed into open positions.\nManagement of some departments throughout the four hospitals will be re-aligned, and some services will be consolidated, the news release said.\n\"Our business is changing,\" said Lynn Bruchhof, MidMichigan Health vice president of human resources. \"We are fortunate to be able to realign our talent resources, our people, to areas of growth and need throughout MidMichigan Health.\"\nSome employees will retire, while others are volunteering to take part-time positions, and still others are applying for the 120 open positions in MidMichigan Health, she said."

        "text": "Tennessee farmers are cashing in on the local food movement.\nThe federal government never measured just how much Tennessee farmers sold directly to customers at, say, a farmers market, but when it did (for the first time this year), it found a huge, farm-fresh, steaming pile of cash.\nTennessee consumers spent more than $58.7 million with farmers directly in 2015, according to the first survey on direct-to-consumer sales from the federal government. Across the country, Tennessee ranks 15th for the number of farms selling directly to consumers.\n\"We know that many people care about what they eat and want to know where their food comes from,\" said Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton. \"This survey shows what that farmer-to-consumer relationship is worth in Tennessee.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted the survey to get data on the growing and changing local-food sectors across the country. It found that 4,148 Tennessee farms sold food directly to consumers in 2015, and more are getting in the game in a hurry.\n\"The number of farms selling directly to consumers increased more than 500 in the three years since the [last agriculture census],\" said Debra Kenerson, a Tennessee state statistician. \"This shows tremendous growth in a short period of time.\"\nThe farm sales include fresh foods like meat and vegetables but also edible processed foods like bottled milk, cheese, meat, jam, cider, and wine. Farmers sold these goods to institutions like schools, universities, hospitals, wholesalers, and distributors.\nBut farmers also sold their goods directly to the person who would eat them at farmers markets, farm stores, roadside stands, through community supported agriculture (CSA) arrangements, online sales, pick-your-own operations, and mobile markets.\nSandy Watson, a board member with the Cooper-Young Community Farmers Market, said the more consumers are educated on the importance of eating locally sourced, healthy food, the more likely they are to hit farmers markets for their weekly grocery shopping.\nThis, Watson said, is fueling the local food movement. That movement is responsible for the year-over-year growth seen at the Cooper-Young market and responsible for the big numbers the government found when looking at direct-to-consumer farm sales.\nThose big sales figures, too, provide a \"real opportunity for more farmers to capitalize on the'buy local' movement,\" Kenerson said.\nThe strength of that \"buy local movement\" is a big reason the Cooper-Young market is now open year-round.\n\"We don't stop eating when winter comes, and many of the local farmers are producing year-round,\" Watson said. \"Our winter market is just as busy as the spring/summer market, and some of the best vegetables are those grown in the winter.\"\nWhile much of the food consumed in Memphis was not likely grown here, a move is underway to change that. Last year, the East Arkansas Planning and Development District and the Memphis-Shelby County Office of Sustainability launched Delta Roots: The Mid-South Regional Food System Plan.\nThe plan lays out a 20-year path to a local, sustainable food network here in which consumers will eat more locally grown products and farmers can cash in on the $550 million annual demand for produce in the Memphis area."

        "text": "Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesReynaldo Rodriguez of the Care Coordination program counseled a patient with H.I.V. on how to adhere to a drug regimen.\nDoctors are very good at telling us what to do — but we are very poor at doing it. In fact, the health problems of millions of Americans are directly related to our failure to follow doctors’ orders.\nDoctors tell us to take our pills, exercise, go get that C.T. scan, stop smoking, change our diets, cut out salt, quit drinking, monitor our blood sugar. We know we should do it, but we very often don’t. About three-quarters of patients do not keep appointments for follow-up care. In one study of diabetes patients, only 7 percent were compliant enough with their treatment plans to control the disease. Even people at grave and immediate risk do not always take their medicines: a quarter of kidney transplant patients in one study did not take their medicines correctly, putting them at risk for organ rejection. Among elderly patients with congestive heart failure, 15 percent of repeat hospitalizations were linked to failure to take prescribed medicines. And compliance with exercise and diet programs is even worse. Poor compliance is a major reason that sick people don’t get better, and that our health care costs are so high.\nIt is a reason that often gets ignored. Many doctors are uncomfortable wrestling with adherence. They may even believe that it is not their problem, that their job is done when they write the prescription or hand the patient a diet plan. But even concerned doctors would find themselves helpless in a 10-minute office visit. They are too removed from their patients, too much the authority figure to really get to the bottom of why a patient isn’t doing what he is supposed to.\nBad adherence doesn’t discriminate by social class. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with high cholesterol and blood pressure and yet can’t manage to stick to an exercise program. Far fewer — but far sicker and more expensive to the health care system — are the handful of emergency room frequent flyers: people with multiple serious conditions such as AIDS, diabetes, hypertension, depression, mental illness, social isolation, substance abuse or domestic violence. Such people have extraordinary problems sticking to their plans to get better, and need extraordinary help.\nJoe McManus is a 56-year-old former heroin and crack addict who lives in a single-resident-occupancy apartment in Manhattan. He spent 15 years as an addict, about 10 of them homeless. In some ways, he’s far from the typical homeless person. He used to work on Wall Street and still retains some of his Wall Street friends. In 2005, one of those friends took him to the Super Bowl.\nIn other ways, he is absolutely typical of drug users who have hit bottom. McManus has AIDS, Hepatitis C and liver problems. “My doctors went three or four years with me not showing up,” he said in a recent interview in his apartment. “I had no relationship with her — except for her to put me in the hospital because I didn’t listen to what she had to say. I was still not addressing the fact that I was H.I.V.-positive. I was not taking my medicine and only going to the hospital when I had to be put in the hospital. I was still messing around with drugs.” McManus was hospitalized four times in the year before November, 2009. Then he got a visit from Reynaldo Rodriguez.\nWhen Rodriguez first visited McManus, he had already quit drugs, on his own. But he was still living as if he were homeless. His apartment was covered with soot and grime, the bed had cigarette burns and the refrigerator held moldy food. McManus was treating his apartment like it was the street. “How the hell are you living like this?” Rodriguez blurted out.\nIt made a difference. McManus started taking his medicines. The medicines brought down his viral load — he was getting better, and that motivated him to take care of himself. McManus is thin and twitchy, but when I saw him was dressed in jeans and a nice zippered sweater, and the apartment was in reasonable condition. McManus is now 100 percent adherent to his medicines, and his hospital stays amounted to only a single night in the last 16 months. He said that part of it was a spiritual awakening, but it was clear that Rodriguez played a huge role. McManus now goes to all his doctor’s appointments on his own.\nBut that doesn’t mean he follows all of his doctor’s advice. He’s no longer doing crack, but he’s still drinking — several nights a week he goes to hang out in a friend’s bar. He loves the bar — it’s his entire social network.\nBut his Hepatitis C makes this dangerous behavior, and his doctor was stern: “You can not ever have a drink again. Not even on your birthday,” she told him. “I never have to tell you if I ever have one,” McManus thought to himself.\nRodriguez and McManus worked out a compromise: he could keep going to the bar, but he had to tell his friends about his health problems so they would put the brakes on. He had to try to drink less, and keep doing tests that monitored his liver.\n“He’s been very honest with me,” Rodriguez said. Why more than with your doctor? I asked McManus.\n“She’s a doctor,” he said.\nThe Care Coordination program, a city-wide initiative now in 28 sites in different hospitals around New York, was inspired and trained by a Boston-based program called PACT, for Prevention, Access to Care and Treatment. PACT is part of Partners in Health — a nongovernmental group famous for its work in Haiti, Rwanda and elsewhere. Part of Partners’ strategy is to use people from the community who are paid a stipend to visit patients, watch them take their pills and support them. Since 1995, PACT has been using these ideas in tough neighborhoods of Boston, first with H.I.V. patients and now with people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. The PACT project trains people from the community, some of whom have the same diseases and similar problems as their patients, to be community health workers.\nThe new health reform law encourages pilot programs to try different forms of medical homes, and the better care and cost savings that come from improving adherence with peers or lay people like Rodriguez are attractive. The New Yorker magazine writer Atul Gawande recently profiled two clinics that use this model, in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J.\nThere are successful programs that use nurses for outreach. The Nurse-Family Partnership sends nurses to visit low-income first-time mothers, beginning in pregnancy and continuing until the child is two. The program now operates in 32 states and has proven to greatly improve the life of both child and mother. The Camden program that Gawande wrote about also uses nurses and nurse practitioners to make home visits.\nBut nurses are expensive home visitors, and they may not even be the best people for the job. “Given the rising cost of health care, we have found having peer-based health promoters providing care management is an equally effective way to provide high-quality care at a low cost,” said Ayesha Cammaerts, the director of operations at PACT. “Especially with patients who suffer from substance abuse and mental health issues, they need someone they feel comfortable letting into their environment. Sometimes patients don’t feel they can connect to clinicians from outside their community,” she said.\nPACT’s methods work. A study of AIDS patients found that the patients’ use of appropriate medicines rose — they were becoming adherent. At the same time, spending on hospitalization dropped by nearly two-thirds. Overall, patient costs dropped by 36 percent. Even taking into account the $6,000-per-patient cost of PACT, patient costs dropped 16 percent. And in a group of people who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement.\nThe PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine. Many of the deficiencies of American health care require not more technology, but the human touch. It’s certainly true for high-risk, high-cost patients, but it can help nearly everyone get better health for less money. In Saturday’s column, I’ll write about how."

Wacha is 4-7 with a 6.41 ERA in 16 games (14 starts) against the Cubs.\nThe Cubs will enter Sunday's primetime showdown having lost four straight games after putting together five straight victories. The Cubs finally showed promise offensively Saturday, when they snapped a nine-game string of games in which they scored three or fewer runs.\nBut after blowing two different leads as their slide continued, the Cubs will attempt to get back on track in Sunday's series finale.\nThe back and forth Cubs performance has been difficult to predict after they finished a 5-2 homestand despite struggling to score runs.\nManager Joe Maddon found silver linings in the Cubs' recent roller coaster ride and continues to point to how early in the season his team's Jekyll and Hyde act has surfaced.\n\"Regardless of what your plan may be, teams are going to go through these moments,\" Maddon told reporters before Saturday's game, according to the Chicago Tribune. \"It just happens to be ours right now. I want to continue to work like we've been working. I believe in our guys and believe in our methods. It's just the ebb and flow of the season. Right now, it's our turn. We'll come out of it and be fine.\"\nJon Lester will take the mound for the Cubs. Lester (2-1, 2.73) has already beaten the Cardinals once this season when he threw six innings and allowed an unearned run and two hits April 19.

The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to realize it. A capital strike against the periphery by both creditors in the Eurozone and international investors forced the periphery to adopt policies they would not have otherwise.\nLarge pools of capital, including central banks and sovereign wealth funds continue to buy French bonds, keeping yields near German levels. The logic is not so much about fair value based on economic fundamentals. Instead, it is a political judgment. Despite the divergence between German and French economic prowess, the two remain the twin pillars of Europe. As long as one is confident that EMU remains intact, then France's credit is as good as German credit.\nThat same logic, of course, can be applied to other euro area countries. On one hand, officials want investors to distinguish between different credit conditions. On the other hand, they insist they will not allow EMU to fail. As we have learned over the last couple of years, this does not preclude sovereign debt restructuring (Greece and Cyprus), and even capital controls (Cyprus).\nThe peripheral premium over Germany was narrower prior to the crisis. There was even a brief shining moment that Spain traded through Germany (this is to say that yields slipped marginally below German yields). Continued easing of ECB monetary policy can see spreads compress further. However, it is unreasonable to think the spreads can return to status quo ante, as the risk of debt restructuring must be perceived as higher than before.\nManagers of large pools of capital recognize there are not sufficient bunds available. Recall that next year, the German coalition government has committed itself to a balanced budget. That means new supply is not going to be forthcoming. French bonds are seen as the next best alternative, and they offer a slightly higher yield to boot. Simply, if crudely put, French bonds are to German bunds, what Agency debt is to US Treasuries.\nWithout the push of necessity, French politicians find it difficult to do the right thing. They are reluctant to declare a break from the German ordo-liberalism's drive for fiscal austerity, but refuse to embrace it. Last month, Hollande unilaterally declared no more effort to reach the EC budget targets that had already been postponed. The EC implicitly threatened to reject it, but reports suggesting that Merkel was reluctant to push France hard, possibly fearing to do to the AfD, what Cameron has done for the UKIP.\nInstead, the EC accepted some cockamamie sleight of hand. France would cut its structural deficit by 0.5% instead of 0.2% as Hollande initially proposed. This would be accomplished by 1) assuming lower debt servicing costs, 2) reducing its EU budget contribution, 3) proposing nearly a billion euro savings from a crackdown on tax evasion. Recall that Brussels had expected, and France had previously agreed to a 0.8% reduction in its structural deficit.\nPerhaps Merkel was worried about the rise of the National Front in France. Le Pen embraces the social welfare state of France. It sees the biggest threat to it, not coming from the discipline being imposed by what Thomas Friedman has called the \"golden straightjacket\", but by the encroachment of French sovereignty. The culprit is the German fist inside the EC glove and enshrined in the monetary union.\nYet the leaders of France's main political parties are doing more to boost the National Front than anyone, including, arguably, Marine Le Pen. She often claims that there is significant collusion between the major parties. She says that the Socialists and the UMP are a single self-interested group. The developments in France this week provide her with the proverbial smoking gun.\nConsider this: Hollande's chief of staff Jouyet is a personal friend of the French President. He also served in the Sarkozy government. He reportedly had lunch with Sarkozy's rival in the UMP, Fillon, who was also a prime minister in Sarkozy's government. Among the things they talked about was the investigation into overspending by the Sarkozy re-election campaign in 2012.\nWhat are not agreed upon are the reports that suggest Fillon, threatened by Sarkozy's attempt at a political comeback, wanted the Hollande government to expedite the investigation. The idea was hit Sarkozy quickly and hard to derail his hope to be elected as the head of the UMP next month. Yet, it does seem Sarkozy himself is struggling without any help. Ever since he threw his hat in the ring, his support in the polls has deteriorated. Last month, his candidate to head the Senate lost, suggesting Sarkozy's support in the UMP is not insurmountable.\nHollande's has the lowest support of any French president since the end of WWII. He is half-way through his five-year mandate, and he recently indicated he would not seek re-election if there were no improvement in the unemployment rate. It is an idle threat. Barring a miracle, he cannot win, and the Socialist Party may dump him. We might be witnessing the slow and painful death of the Fifth Republic. The other republics ended by war or a coup, but this one may be ending due to self-immolation. The Socialist candidate who ran against Sarkozy in 2007, S. Royal, who was once Hollande's life partner, used to talk about a Sixth Republic.\nAlthough Merkel is recognized as the outstanding leader in Europe, she is playing with a strong hand, the hand that holds the purse. France has a weak hand, and yet despite the lack of strong leadership, it has done remarkably well in pursuing its agenda. It has been given more time to reach the 3% deficit/GDP mandate. After years of complaining about the strong euro, in word and deed the ECB is now driving the euro lower.\nFrance has wanted the ECB to pursue aggressive monetary policy, which it now is. The ECB will likely increases the range of assets it is buying under its version of QE and if may include corporate bonds. Given that the French capital markets are more developments than most in the euro area, including Germany, its corporate bond market is among the largest. Almost 45% of the corporate bonds issued by Eurozone companies are accounted for by French businesses.\nAfter Russia occupied two areas in Georgia after the 2008 conflict, and its continuous in attempts to intimidate it neighbors, France thought it reasonable to sell Russia two ships that can be used for amphibious assaults. France has been reluctant to renege on its contract, which reportedly has penalty clauses for failure to deliver. However, within weeks of the expected delivery of the first ship, there is talk of an alternative. Reports suggest that NATO could be favorable disposed to buy the ships from France. Perhaps the logic is that it is better to own them then possibly fight against them.\nAsset managers are unlikely to declare a capital strike against France. The premium France pays over Germany for 10-year money is about 36 bp presently. In the past six months, the premium has approached 30 basis point a few times, but never penetrated. The mid-September low of 31 bp was the smallest French premium in three years. This seems to be the floor.\nThe ceiling seems to be about 47 bp, which it neared three times in the past six months, most recently on October 20. Recall that, in the four years before the crisis, there were several occasions where the French yield dipped slightly below the German yield. In any event, pre-crisis, France did not pay more than a 10 bp premium.\nNeither international capital, represented by asset managers nor the EC is going to force France to enact structural reforms. In addition, there is even less of a chance that Hollande makes a clean break and announces an aggressively pro-growth fiscal initiative. This means the continuation of the charade, yet the status quo is toxic. The political elite are committing a French version of hara-kiri. What fertile terrain for the National Front."

The ocelot is a vulnerable creature, susceptible to habitat changes like roads, agriculture, housing developments and trapping. There may be fewer than 100 left in southern United States.\nConcerns that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is making the plight of these'dwarf leopards' worse led the Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians to take legal action against the USDA's Wildlife Services program. They are suing Wildlife Services for \"failing to ensure that it is not harming ocelots.\"\nWildlife Services describes itself as a program that resolves human - wildlife conflicts so people can \"co-exist\" with nature, but often, their solution to wildlife problems involves traps and cyanide capsules. They use these methods to deal with predators that are bothering farmers, but The Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians say ocelots are getting caught in the cross-fire, killed by methods that can't tell the difference between an ocelot and a fox.\n\"Wildlife Services routinely fails to comply with federal laws like the Endangered Species Act,\" said Tara Zuardo, wildlife attorney with the Animal Welfare Institute in a press release. \"Few ocelots remain in the United States and they require basic protection to ensure that they are not killed by the devices—such as steel-jaw leghold traps and cyanide capsules—Wildlife Services indiscriminately uses on public lands to kill wildlife.\"\nThis is not the first time the methods of Wildlife Services have been criticised. This June, the Washington Post reported it had killed more than 4 million animals through poisoning, snaring and shooting in 2013 alone.\nBut from year to year, the number of animals killed by the program fluctuates significantly, from 1.5 to 5 million. In 2008, 5 million animals were killed while over the next four years it was 3 million.The number is not rising, as Wildlife Services suggests, causing critics to question their justification for their methods.\nSo far, their secretive approach has gone relatively unnoticed. Now, the Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians are trying to change that."

It takes arrogance and narcissism to become leader of a Fortune 500 company. Those same traits, however, have become their undoing during the deepest recession in decades.\nU.S. President Barack Obama has noticed, telling reporters on Thursday he was outraged by a New York State report that $18.4 billion in Wall Street bonuses were paid in 2008 as taxpayers rescued the crumbling financial system. \"That is the height of irresponsibility. It is shameful,\" Obama said.\nNew York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is investigating Wall Street bonuses, welcomed Obama&apos;s comments. \"While Wall Street melted down, top executives believed that, unlike the rest of the country, they still deserved huge bonuses,\" Cuomo said.\nFor Bob Monks, a former executive who has written nine books on corporate governance, the reason is that the rich and powerful simply love their toys. \"It&apos;s a boy thing. Sort of, &apos;Mine&apos;s bigger than yours.&apos; It&apos;s really childish,\" said Monks, a shareholder rights activist and the subject of a book called \"A Traitor to His Class.\"\nMonks related a story about flying on someone&apos;s corporate jet. The host was devastated when, upon landing, he saw that while he planned for a limo to be waiting at the airport another captain of industry had a helicopter take him to town. \"I thought my guy was going to die..... It&apos;s entirely about people&apos;s self-image.\"\nLongtime advocates of shareholder rights were handed a gift in November when Detroit auto executives flew to Washington on corporate jets to ask for billions of dollars in taxpayer money, sparking a public outrage.\nMore recently, it became known that former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain spent $1.2 million remodeling his office last year, including $1,405 for a trash can. Merrill Lynch is owned by Bank of America, which consumed $45 billion of taxpayer money through bailouts.\nThen on Tuesday, Citigroup canceled plans to buy a $50 million executive jet after a White House rebuke.\n\"People don&apos;t become head of Merrill Lynch without having a certain sense of self-importance. Once they arrive at that position, they have all kinds of toadies tell them what geniuses they are, then of course they begin to feel their lifelong feelings of self-importance have been confirmed,\" said Charles Goodstein, a psychoanalyst and professor at New York University School of Medicine.\nDefenders of executive perks say generous compensation is needed to retain talent. Sometimes it&apos;s jets but can also include home security systems, country club memberships, sports tickets and financial advice. The value of these benefits is considered income, so CEOs also sometimes get another perk: company help in paying their taxes. \"I was CEO of a bank once and it&apos;s not rocket science. You need the same skill set as somebody running a hardware store in a medium-sized town,\" Monks said.\nSteve Thel, a former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a professor at Fordham Law School, blames compliant board members who often come from the same privileged world and can get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for attending a few meetings each year. \"It&apos;s endemic to the system. The last administration didn&apos;t think there was any structural flaw. Now across the political spectrum people feel that Wall Street executive compensation is out of control,\" Thel said. He predicted Congress would pass legislation granting minority shareholders more say on pay and possibly introduce higher taxes on some parts of executive compensation. \"A year ago it was absolutely unthinkable that this would be heard in Congress,\" Thel said."

If violent crime increases across the Pond likewise in the UK. Then there is shopping madness.\nThe UK is taking up traditional US activities such as Christmas shopping bargain days that leave customers with empty wallets and a range of unwanted goods.\nBlack Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each have become big shopping days on both sides of the Pond. Last Friday many people hit the shops attracted by huge price cuts and today the same is happening online. Is all as it seems though?\nAs usual the answer is probably not.\nIt is so easy to get sucked into spending unnecessarily. You buy in haste and repent at leisure. This year remember it is still in reality a consumer market. Businesses want your trade. That does not stop some of them throwing the odd rogue item into the pot.\nThis year more than ever retailers will be trying hard to get you to part with your hard-earned money. There will be pre-Christmas sales and bargains long after today. With Christmas a few weeks away perhaps it would be wiser to hang fire. Shop around, be it online or on the High Street, take your time and purchase well.\nBargains are sometimes far from that. They could be second-rate, last year's model or simply stock that is hard to shift. Once it is dressed up with a fancy cut-price sign you may find it hard to resist.\nConsider all the implications of your purchase before you buy.\n1- If you buy online there may be delivery charges but you will be saving a potentially expensive trip to town which could be full of hassle.\n2 - Emails dropping into your inbox, that offer great bargains, can be tempting. However, if you purchase an item you had no intention of buying is it really a bargain? Probably not, especially if money is tight.\nHaving some idea of what you want to buy helps. If you shop \"blind\" you will be more likely to spend more than you should. Online retail oulets, just like the shops, are full of goods you never knew you wanted or needed and in many cases cannot afford.\nCyber Monday also increases the temptation to buy now and pay later. Not a good idea. Pay for purchases online with a switch or debit card so you are not paying for Christmas well into the New Year or even beyond.\nOne factor specific to the UK is that this week Chancellor George Osborne will announce to the country his Autumn statement, or Budget. It is doubtful that it will have a real positive effect on retail trade but it could. It could also cost you dearly in many ways. Brits take care and look after your money this cyber Monday.\nPerhaps the rest of you would be wise to follow suit too!"

Six great restaurants with their very own gardens follow. Call them “roof to table.” By Jessica Allen.\nAtop a 100-year-old building in the West Village grow lettuces, bicolor squash, fennel, dill, parsley, poblano peppers, Japanese eggplant, and tomatoes, among other things, using soil-less, solar-powered hydroponic technology. Bell, Book & Candle incorporates these and other vegetables and herbs into its New American food. Being so close to the source means the chefs don’t refrigerate the produce. In fact, they call the freshly grown produce “dormant, not dead,” since the roots are kept attached until the very last second before cooking.\nRoberta’s might look like a bunker from the outside, but inside the message is all about love—love of good food, love of food to create change, love of the community that comes together around good food. Behind its scruffy exterior lie terrific pizza and pasta, a radio station, a greenhouse, and a very big garden. You can see what’s growing via the garden’s blog, with its photos of violets, edible weeds, raspberries, basil, strawberries, watermelon, peaches, chard, and blackberries, or you can take a seat in the wooden-paneled dining room, beneath a pizza party Barbie and board games, and order whatever’s just been harvested.\nLike most Westin properties around the world, the newest one in New York City features luxurious amenities like the Heavenly Bed® (definitely worth its copyright in plushness), in-room Starbucks coffee, and special velour robes. But this hotel also has its very own organic garden, 384 feet above 42nd Street, supplying veggies and herbs to The LCL: Bar & Kitchen on site. This means fresh mint for mojitos and other cocktails, heirloom tomatoes for gazpacho and other dishes, mesclun lettuce for salads, grilled squash and zucchini as seasonal sides, and everything and anything else Executive Chef Brian Wieler (pictured) can cook up.\nModeled on a shebeen, an informal dining hall, and named for Nelson Mandela, Madiba claims to be the first South African restaurant of its kind in the United States. It opened in Fort Greene in 1999. Its rooftop garden is the source of at least some of the produce on the bushman’s vegetable platter (pictured), including yellow squash, asparagus, string beans, baby bok choy, corn on the cob, spinach, and fat triangles of garlic. This dish serves as a counterpart to meatastic South African braai, or barbecue, a specialty of the restaurant.\nThe people behind Brooklyn Grange, the world’s largest rooftop soil farms, helped construct a much smaller one atop Rosemary’s, an Italian enoteca and trattoria in the West Village. Here, on 1,700 square feet, grow peppers, radishes, arugula, basil, broccoli rabe, and all kinds of organic goodness. Picked produce arrives in the kitchen in a basket using a block and tackle. An actual basket! Not content with herbs and veggies, restaurateur Carlos Suarez has expanded the garden to include a chicken coop and beehive. Diners are sometimes allowed up for a peek.\nWhen chef/restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten and his partners decided to build a rooftop garden 10 stories above Broadway to supply ABC Kitchen with microgreens, herbs, and other produce, they sought out seeds from farmers at the Union Square Greenmarket. In addition to what gets harvested upstairs, the seasonal, oft-changing menu at this James Beard award-winning restaurant includes sustainable, locally sourced (when possible) meat, dairy, seafood, and produce, free of antibiotics and pesticides, along with beverages whose ingredients come from fair-trade cooperatives."

Penn State’s leading tackler went from being a quiet, unquestioned leader to a harsh-talking student representative nearly overnight.\nWhen a scandal and the ensuing fallout threatened to tear apart his team, all Mauti could fight back with were his words.\nTo Penn State fans, Michael Mauti was unknown in 2008.\nHis dad, Rich, had played for the Nittany Lions and went on to his own successful run in the NFL. His brother, Patrick, was a junior on the Nittany Lions. The youngest Mauti was just the new kid — Pat’s little brother — in the No. 42 jersey.\nHe introduced himself eight games into the season. With Michigan in town and threatening to take a two-possession lead at Beaver Stadium, Mauti flew down the field on kickoff coverage in the first quarter and exploded into Michigan return man Sam McGuffie.\nThe football popped free, and although the Wolverines recovered it, a psychological blow had been dealt. The packed stadium was rocking and the Penn State sideline drew sudden inspiration from Mauti’s jackhammer hit.\nThe Nittany Lions then rattled off 39 unanswered points to secure a 46-17 win.\nIt took a hit of that caliber to spark a young Mauti’s love of the game.\nAlthough Rich Mauti played seven seasons in the NFL, he wouldn’t let his sons step on a football field until they were in seventh grade. In Michael’s case, he didn’t start playing until eighth grade.\nIt didn’t take long for the youngest Mauti to be put off by football.\nSo Mauti, the smallest kid on the team, let the season play out. Soon, an unwilling participant became the fiercest of competitors on the freshman team at Mandeville (La.) High School.\nHe started the season as a quarterback but soon found himself making plays on kickoff coverage.\nIt’s not that Mauti intends to injure opponents. He plays within the rules. But he won’t deny that football is a violent game and being the player to initiate contact is Mauti’s specialty.\nIf an opponent remembers Mauti’s number after a hit and has second thoughts about touching the football for the rest of the game, Mauti’s made a huge impact by his own standards.\n“The feeling of the hit. The feeling of delivering a blow, it’s just — There’s something about it,” Mauti said.\nIt was the worst feeling of his playing career — laying on his back on the Beaver Stadium grass, staring up at a blue sky knowing it was happening all over again.\nMauti had torn an anterior cruciate ligament before, so he knew pretty quickly when his left leg buckled during the first quarter of the 2011 Eastern Illinois game that his left leg was shot before he even hit the ground.\nAfter sutting out the entire 2009 season concentrating on rehabilitating his right knee, Mauti came back with a vengeance in 2010. He finished fifth on the team with 57 tackles.\nAn expanded on-field role would have to wait, however, following the early season injury to his left knee last season.\nMauti got luckier the second time around. When he was injured in 2009, he contracted a nasty case of strep throat. He lost nearly 30 pounds and couldn’t eat normally for weeks. Last fall, Mauti was able to stay relatively healthy except for the knee injury. He was able to concentrate on healing after his surgery and took a better approach to his rehab having gone through it just months before.\nThen-defensive coordinator Tom Bradley wanted to keep his star linebacker involved with day-to-day operations. So Mauti became an extra coach, going so far as to call the majority of the defenses in the TicketCity Bowl after Bradley was promoted to interim head coach.\nIt helped having counsel from former Nittany Lions such as Jerome Hayes, Brennan Coakley and Sean Lee - who had been in Mauti’s situation, battling back from knee injuries.\nBeyond two major knee injuries, Mauti has racked up the bumps and bruises one would expect of a brute who plays every snap with reckless abandon, thriving on collisions.\nMauti appeared in 11 games in 2010 and wouldn’t let a sprained ankle suffered against Iowa or a separated shoulder courtesy of Ohio State to keep him away from football.\nMauti learned over a tumultuous summer that he could take on an even greater role for a squad desperately in need of vocal leader.\nWhen the NCAA came down on Penn State with a four-year bowl ban to go along with a $60 million fine and serious scholarship reductions, Mauti and teammate Michael Zordich got together with a plan to combat the NCAA’s harshest penalty.\nThe sanctions gave any Penn State player a free chance to transfer out of the program without giving up a year of eligibility. Some chose to do just that, and other college programs began contacting Penn State players, some even coming to campus on recruiting trips.\nMauti and Zordich took it personally. The duo made their way to Coach Bill O’Brien after the NCAA penalties were announced, and the next day made a statement outside of the team’s practice complex that Penn State players would stick together.\nFor the most part, the Nittany Lions have.\nMauti said he was honored to eulogize Joe Paterno at a memorial service following the longtime coach’s death in January. Speaking last in a line of players, each representing a decade Paterno in which coached, Mauti took to the lectern in the Bryce Jordan Center with no notes and spoke from the heart.\nHe told the story of his initial recruitment. Mauti’s family didn’t expect him to commit on the spot to Paterno, but that’s what happened. Mauti remembered Paterno giving him flack for getting kicked out of a drill for fighting as a freshman.\n“‘Hey, your dad used to act like he was tough, too, trying to fight people all the time,’” Mauti said in his best high-pitched impression of Paterno.\nPat Fitzgerald’s eyes are trained to watch football and immediately evaluate.\nWhen the Northwestern coach dissects an opposing team’s defense, his eyes go to the linebackers first. Fitzgerald, himself a college football hall of famer who played the position, sees no weaknesses in Mauti’s game.\nMauti won’t dwell on his past. He won’t allow the fear of being injured to creep into his mind.\nHe won’t let the negative white noise, the criticism of his team or school by outside talking heads, distract him. Like he did this summer, when other coaches were on Penn State’s campus, looking to lure Nittany Lion players way, Mauti will give them an earful. He’ll do everything in his power to keep opposing coaches away.\nIf that means he has to talk, so be it. Mauti said he would rather hit someone between the sidelines.\nHe’ll throw himself into Northwestern players with explosive zeal. He’ll get up off the pile of players and high step his way back to the Penn State sideline.\nMimicking his big-hit celebration at his seat in the Lasch Football Building, Mauti bounces both of his legs simultaneously so his knees come up above the table where he’s sitting.\nMauti’s presence is heavily requested these days. He does this interview, then he’s got to get going.\n“For me, I’ve got nothing to lose, man,” he says. “I’m just playing every play like it’s my last.\n“For all I know it could be taken away on any play."

        "text": "T-Mobile has just rolled out a service called HotSpot @Homethat allows you to use a WiFi-enabled cell phone to make calls via a wireless network. You'll still use the phone with regular cellular airwaves while on the move, but once you're in range of a T-Mobile Hotspot or a pre-configured WiFi access point, the phone will know to automatically switch over. The best part? Call minutes made via WiFi aren't deducted from your plan. That's right -- as long as you're within range of a wireless broadband network, you'll have unlimited calls. An added benefit to this is that you're almost guaranteed great signal strength when you're in a place with good WiFi coverage. And since T-Mobile is providing special T-Mobile configured D-Link and Linksys wireless routers that offer optimal @Home coverage, you might as well say Sayonara to that old-fashioned landline at home.\nCompatible handsets at launch are the Samsung T409 and the Nokia 6086, which cost $49.99 each with a contract. When you sign up with the service, you'll get one of the aforementioned wireless routers for free after rebate, but any 802.11b-compatible router should work. The service is an additional $9.99 per month on top of your existing T-Mobile plan, and an additional $19.99 per month on family plans that have up to five handsets. Personally, I think it's a pretty cool idea, though I don't know if such a service will make up for the fact that T-Mobile has yet to roll out a proper 3G service like the rest of its competitors. We currently have the Samsung t409 plus a Hotspot-configured Linksys router in house, and will let you know what we think of it soon."

        "text": "The FINANCIAL (AD) -- ProCredit Bank has donated a unique ex libris collection to the National Centre of Manuscripts. This donation was part of a project jointly initiated by the National Centre of Manuscripts and ProCredit Bank, in which the Bank bought a unique collection of ex librises from a private individual living in Thessaloniki, Greece.\nMany of the graphic images on the ex librises were the work of Georgian painters, so their donation to the National Centre of Manuscripts is a very important contribution to preserving the heritage of Georgian manuscripts. They carry additional information about the life and creative work of Georgia’s artists and important public figures.\n“From ProCredit Bank’s side we are extremely delighted to have had the chance to support Georgia’s culture and inheritance of manuscripts. It’s extremely rewarding to have had the chance to hand over this unique and interesting collection of ex librises to the National Centre of Manuscripts; that we had the opportunity to obtain these very interesting examples of Georgian culture and history. By handing this collection today to the National Centre of Manuscripts we also, one more time, want to demonstrate our support for the development of Georgian culture. All in all I think it’s a very promising beginning for a hopefully fruitful and long-lasting relationship with the National Centre of Manuscripts,” said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\n“In the National Centre of Manuscripts there are manuscripts, historical documents, archival materials and library collections. This is one of the largest collections across the country. It has been gathering material and growing since the 19th century; this process is still ongoing and will never be finished. The collection has mainly grown from people’s donations, except for a few exceptions. Over the years we received donations from individuals, families, from private companies, public and private organizations. And the result is a unique collection which is now protected by the National Centre of Manuscripts,” he added.\n“Today, one of the priorities for us is searching for new materials and continuing the pursuit of our great ancestors, who began collecting such materials in the 19th century. We also have another sub-priority, as just like this material was found in a foreign country, great care is needed not to lose Georgia-related materials that may be located abroad. They shouldn’t fall into someone else’s hands, in some cases private collectors. Then the trace will be lost,” Buba Kudava said.\n“We were searching over the internet with our colleagues for information of this sort, and we managed to connect with an individual in Thessaloniki, Greece. We asked them to send us information on a regular basis about Georgia-related materials. And indeed they sent us the ex libris collection and when we showed this material to experts, it turned out to be very interesting. There are many famous figures associated with these ex librises. On the one hand, one part of this collection was designed by well-known artists. The second part is known because it is created for famous statesmen, but by a lesser-known Georgian painter. The first is the Elene Akhvlediani ex libris, the second is the Sergo Kobuladze ex libris. We did not have a separate collection of ex librises until now. Of course there are such materials in archives and in books, but so far we have not had such an amount of ex librises,” he said.\n“Ex librises were invented along with book printing and were an integral part of a book through the ages. Today, some of them are considered works of art. That is why participation in such a project is very important for ProCredit Bank, and we are very pleased that this unique ex libris collection has been added to the heritage of Georgian manuscripts,” said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\nThe term “ex libris” is Latin for “from the library of”, and is used to describe a printed label on the inside front cover of a book indicating the name of the owner. In the past, ex librises often took the form of a drawing, an emblem or an illustration of some famous event, sometimes by a famous artist."

        "text": "\"Oh, you are stuck on homework problem number 13? I found a solution on YouTube. That helped a lot. Just Google it, you can find all the solutions.\"\nThe second problem is partially my fault. When I give an in-class assessment, I leave the solution out on the front desk so that students can check their answers when they are finished. Instead of studying this and figuring out their mistakes, students will usually just take a quick picture of the solutions using their phone. Of course they ask if it's OK to take a snapshot first, and I let them. However, the problem is that they think of the solution as something to collect rather than something to learn from.\nConfusion is the sweat of learning.\nYou can't just google a physics solution and expect to learn. Imagine if Luke Skywalker had access to the Internet on Dagobah. Here's what would have happened when his x-wing sunk beneath the water.\nYoda: So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Do you nothing that I say?\nLuke: Master moving stones around is one thing, but this is entirely different. But let me just Google \"how to lift an x-wing with the Force.\" Ah. Here it is.\nOf course that's not what happened (I would make this alternate scene into a comic if I could actually draw). Luke learned about the Force by failing. Yes, students learn physics by working on problems and by failing to solve problems. It's the journey to the solution that's important, not the solution itself. Using a video solution would be like using a golf cart to run 5 miles. Sure, you end up in the same place if you run or ride—but they do not produce the same results.\nBut why do students think this? Why do they think learning is as simple as quick search or a photo with their smart phone? There are likely many reasons for students to hold these learning beliefs. However, I popular media often doesn't help. Remember this scene from The Avengers?\nSHIELD agent Maria Hill asks Tony Stark: \"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\" Stark's answer: \"Last night\". This shows that Tony Stark is so awesome he just figured astrophysics out last night. Clearly, students feel that you have to be a special superhero to understand astrophysics. You either get it in one night, or you'll never get it. I would prefer to have Stark say \"Well, I've been working in this field for 10 years and I'm just scratching the surface.\" Maybe that wouldn't fit too well in the movie.\nOr here's another good one from Days of Thunder.\nCole pulls up to the race track to test out a stock car.\nHarry Hogge: What do you know about stock car racing?\nCole Trickle: Well.... watched it on television, of course.\nHarry Hogge: You've seen it on television?\nCole Trickle: ESPN. The coverage is excellent, you'd be surprised at how much you can pick up.\nHarry Hogge: I'm sure I would.\nSee. Learning is simple. You just need to watch some videos and you'll be all set—except when you aren't. Nope. Learning is tough, but it's totally worth it."

        "text": "These two healthcare REITs are trading for dirt-cheap valuations despite high dividends and a solid history of growth.\nInvesting in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, is one of the best ways to enjoy high dividends and the potential for capital growth. On a valuation basis, REITs specializing in healthcare properties are trading cheaply right now, and two seem to be a particularly good bargain: HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW).\nThis type of real estate should be an excellent long-term investment for three main reasons: demographics, increased healthcare spending, and market opportunity.\nDemographics indicate a growing demand for healthcare properties over the coming decades. Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification. This way, if one market faces headwinds (say, the U.S.), it won't represent virtually all of Medical Properties' assets.\nThe company does have a relatively high debt load for a REIT: Debt represents 51.6% of Medical Properties' assets, so there's added risk to consider. However, 98% of the portfolio's leases have annual rent increases built in, and the company's payout ratio is less than two-thirds of FFO -- lower than that of most peers.\nIn short, there's no reason to believe Medical Properties Trust will have any debt-related issues going forward, with a growing stream of income that's already more than enough to cover the dividend.\nNote: Share prices and guidance are current as of 5/23/16. Normalized or adjusted FFO guidance is used when available.\nNo stock with double-digit growth potential is without risk, and these two are certainly no exception. In fact, a higher level of perceived risk is responsible for the low valuations. Healthcare spending could slow, operating partners could face greater financial difficulties, or there could be a shortage of attractive acquisition opportunities in the target property types. Any one of these factors could cause these stocks to take a dive.\nHowever, I think the growth potential and the solid track record of delivering profits in a variety of economic climates more than make up for the risks. Either of these healthcare REITs would make a solid addition to a well-diversified dividend growth portfolio."

        "text": "Young Lions skipper Brad Galvin isn’t afraid of taking his side’s ‘scrappy’ style of play into Sunday’s semi final clash with Henwood Park. Galvin has headlined the Lions’ defensive unit from centre back this season, putting together a string of solid performances to contain rival sides to just 28 goals in their 19 games to date. Now, the 27-year-old is relishing the lead-up to a shot at grand final glory and says there’s no reason why his team mates can’t tough out another gritty win against the favoured Hawks. “We really toughed it out against Leeton last weekend but we’ve been doing that all year,” Galvin said. “It was a pretty scrappy win and we defended like our lives depended on it when they threw everything at us in the last few minutes.” Having only just taken over the captaincy from the unavailable Duncan Cameron, Galvin is facing the unusual prospect of being one of the side’s most senior players in just his second season at Hall Bros Oval. The defender also admitted his surprise at Young’s run to the finals but credited the injection of youth into the side. “We were really in a building phase last year and we copped a few floggings with all those juniors blokes coming in,” Galvin said. “Now, we’ve kept that core group together for two years and I think we’ve come along quicker than we anticipated. “That comes down to those younger boys in the side having an impact and guys like Alex Mitchell, who I’d say is one of the fastest blokes in the competition, and Pat Hislop have been real standouts all year.” All eyes are now fixed upon the task ahead - toppling the defending premiers. Galvin knows it’s no easy task but says the result will be vastly different from their 6-0 loss to Henwood Park in July. “We were missing a few players from our back line that game, so I think that probably affected us a fair bit,” Galvin said. “Still, we know they’ll be hard to get on top of and they’ll throw everything at us in attack. “We’ll just have to hold them out and look to hit them through counterattack.” While you’re with us, did you know that The Daily Advertiser is now offering sports and local events as part of its growing email newsletter service?

        "text": "It’s dense, interesting, weird and funny, but what it’s all wrapped around is another “Chosen One” story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, crumbling into something tiresome and tedious.\nWhere the science-fiction genre is concerned, it’s not hard to at the very least appreciate the ambition of the storytelling. It takes an honest, extra layer of creativity to create a reality not bound by the restrictions of our own, and it can be a delight to watch a perfect mixture of detailed universe building mesh with smart, unique storytelling. Of course, this requires delicate balance, as a dip too far one way finds a convoluted mess, and a dip in the opposite direction creates something that ultimately feels hollow and incomplete. It is sadly the former trap to which Andy and Lana Wachowski’s Jupiter Ascending falls victim.\nIn a similar vein to what they were able to accomplish with previous sci-fi stories like The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending is a narrative set in a vivid and comprehensive world. There are legions of soldiers who have had their DNA spliced with animals – like the wolf-infused Caine (Channing Tatum) or the bee-like Stinger (Sean Bean). There are galaxy-spanning businesses where worlds are held like long-term investments. There’s even intergalactic low-level bureaucracy that has all varieties of individuals waiting in lines and shuffling from one department to the next. It’s dense, interesting, weird and at times funny, but what it’s all wrapped around is another “Chosen One” story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, eventually crumbling into something tiresome and tedious – albeit consistently beautiful.\nThe Wachowskis do legitimately make good choices in the casting department, as both Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum make for fun, charismatic leads to take us through the story. Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, an illegal alien living with her Russian immigrant family and working as a housekeeper living in modern day Chicago. As we see happen oh so often at the cinema, however, her life changes in an instant when she meets Caine (Tatum), an intergalactic bounty hunter. Jupiter is not only made aware of life on other planets, but also that she is the genetic recurrence of one of the most powerful women in the galaxy, and stands to literally inherent the Earth now that she has passed away. It’s a simple and rather familiar plot, but through a first act of enjoyable “awakening” material and sky-shredding action scenes, Jupiter Ascending holds its own.\nIt’s with the introduction of the trio of central villains that everything begins to fall apart – which is a sincere problem considering that they wind up completely driving the entire story. These are the three surviving members of the Abrasax family -- Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) – and the sons and daughter of the woman whom Jupiter Jones is a genetic equal. Each of them has a personal desire to take control of the Earth – which is alternately described as being extremely valuable and just a single piece of a much larger business – but also each take their own place doing more harm to the movie than good. Kalique winds up being mostly useless to the story, simply providing huge amounts of exposition and then disappearing; Titus merely feels like a stall in the narrative, serving as what is really a fairly pointless obstacle; and Balem simply feels overcooked in every sense, with Redmayne giving a highly bizarre, scenery-chewing performance full of needless affectation that makes him stick out like a sore thumb (really making you wonder what kind of off-base directions he was being given by the Wachowskis). As Jupiter Ascending’s plot encounters these characters, the film begins to degrade faster and faster, exploring needless and unnecessary elements of the sci-fi world that do more subtraction than addition.\nAt this point in their careers, Andy and Lana Wachowski have become better known for their visual flash and style, and it serves the movie well. Their flair is apparent from the costume and makeup work (the idea of DNA splicing works magic in this department) to the production design, and it all serves to provide Jupiter Ascending with a unique feel (even when it wears references to movies like Brazil on its sleeve). Immense credit also goes to the visual effects teams, who not only render some fantastic air battles and spaceships, but also expansive alien environments that do their part to make the audience feel like they’re being taken to a different world. All of this spectacle doesn’t make up for the fact that character motivations are at times completely dubious, and that the third act drags on far too long, but it does help.\nIt’s hard to really begrudge a film like Jupiter Ascending, both for its creative scope and in that it is one of the few-and-far-between female-led action movies, but it is equally hard to validate it beyond those elements, it’s aesthetics, and the casting of the leads. There is perhaps a better feature that exists partially on the cutting room floor – explaining some of the more bizarre plot developments/holes – or one that could have been made with just a few tweaks to the screenplay. But the movie that will be hitting theaters this week is best described as unfortunate."

        "text": "For a career that once seemed so good on paper, the crisis in teacher recruitment is now hardly ever out of the news.\nThere are not enough people signing up to become teachers and too many are dropping out - some experienced due to the stress and increase in workload but often the newly qualified leave the profession, unprepared for the life in the classroom.\nSchool lead Andrew Truby, a national leader of education, is determined to change the narrative about teaching as a profession.\nHe feels school leaders have it in their gift to change this situation on the ground by making brave decisions and by investing in the professional culture so that schools become irresistible places to work.\nAt St Thomas of Canterbury School, in Meadowhead, where Mr Truby is executive headteacher, there is a 100 per cent school-based teacher training school which is going from strength-to-strength.\nThe outstanding Ofsted-rated school became a teaching school in 2015, and works with partner schools in the Learning Unlimited Teaching School Alliance.\nThe alliance, based in a modern training facility at the school, takes on School Direct trainees on a year-long programme.\nEach student is placed in one of 14 partner schools across Sheffield, Doncaster and Chesterfield for the entire programme, where they will work for a year alongside outstanding and primary class teachers.\nTeaching school manager, Anita Bray, said: \"The beauty of this course is that trainee teachers are based in a school for the whole programme.\n\"They encounter children and liaise with parents. They do things like parents evening - all the nitty gritty.\n\"The trainee teachers have been there and have done it, they have had that experience which is much different from doing it in classrooms.\"\nDuring the course, students spend time in another of the partner schools so they get to experience life in two schools.\nThey are given a mentor who, at first, they observe, then plan lessons alongside before the mentor oversees the trainee teacher planning and delivering the lessons.\nThe trainee teachers meet once a week at the School Direct hub session for training, with specialist leaders of education or subject specialists coming in to take sessions.\nTeaching school director, Sarah Rockliff, described the process as'learning by doing'.\nShe said: \"Trainee teachers are in classrooms and they are coming to hub sessions and picking up ideas about teaching and learning and then the next day they get the chance to put that into practice.\n\"Teaching is a craft and the only way to become a master of your craft is to keep practising it.\"\nShe added: \"After only a few weeks the trainees start to refer to their partner school as'my school' and they feel a real connection to the school they are working in and are invested in the children. That adds to the motivation.\n\"It's a hard course and requires a lot of hard work.\"\nThe alliance was established in 2015 and the first cohort of students all gained jobs after completing the course.\nTrainees come from a variety of backgrounds, some have been teaching assistants or involved in education, while others are looking for a career change.\nTrainee teacher Nick Walker, aged 31, taught English abroad before returning to England to further his career.\nHe said: \"I have been teaching for five years already and I thought it would be beneficial to me to be in a hands-on situation and seeing what it was like day-today.\n\"I was at university 10 years ago. I wanted to carry on learning and this feels like a job whereas if I'd gone back to university it would have felt like a step backwards.\"\nFormer secondary school teaching assistant Kirsty Norris, 25, said: \"You see the reality of life in a school. You experience parents' evening and when sometimes your lessons plans just don't work.\n\"It's hard work but you know that next year it will all be worth it.\"\nMr Truby, who is strategic lead for the alliance, said recruiting teachers ready for the classroom had been a challenge in the past.\n\"Recruitment of high quality teachers is an ongoing challenge for schools and in the past the newly qualified teachers who we did appoint were not ready for the classroom,\" he said.\n\"Through our 100 per cent school-based teacher training route, our School Direct trainee teachers experience the full school year in a primary school.\n\"When they start in their NQT year, they are confident in subject knowledge, planning, marking, assessment as well as knowing how the school works throughout the year.\"\nHe felt the perception around teaching needed to change because it is'the best job in the world'.\nHe added: \"Although teaching as a career gets a really bad press and there is a lot of talk about workload, we believe that the schools who invest in their culture will have an easier job recruiting and retaining the best teachers.\n\"We spend time making our schools a positive place to work because happier teachers mean happier children.\n\"It is time to change the narrative about this profession because we believe that teaching is the best job in the world.\"\nThe alliance is still recruiting trainees for September when it will start two new programmes. In addition to general primary, there will be a primary with maths and an early years route."

        "text": "Anna C. Christensen has been a supporter of family planning since high school, when she stuffed envelopes as a volunteer at a Planned Parenthood affiliate in California. Now a Tucson resident, she continues to advocate for reproductive rights and sexual health.\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona serves more than 100,000 families every year; maybe your family is one of them.\nTucson is home to the Margaret Sanger Health Center, namesake of Planned Parenthood's founder. A century ago, Margaret Sanger was a New York City nurse who witnessed the horrors of women dying prematurely after having too many children, while others died from botched abortions. This experience motivated her to become an activist for the availability and legality of contraception. Sanger was a controversial figure—and that controversy lingers to this day.\nSanger first visited Tucson in the 1930s, when she helped set up the Tucson Mother's Health Clinic (also called Clinica Para las Madres), Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona's precursor. Sanger, bedeviled by health problems, was drawn by Tucson's climate. Her husband was drawn by Arizona's lack of income tax, and in 1933, they purchased an adobe house in the foothills.\nIn the early'40s, Sanger and her husband moved closer to the city's heart, as gasoline rations dulled suburbia's attractiveness. They moved into a house on Elm Street, just east of the Arizona Inn. Before his death, her husband obtained an empty lot on Sierra Vista Drive, a stone's throw from their Elm Street residence. Sanger's son Stuart built a house on one side, and Sanger decided to build her dream home on the other.\nSanger's homes hosted lavish parties as well as fundraisers for organizations like Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona and the Tucson Medical Center (of which she was also a co-founder). She took up hobbies such as cooking and watercolor; today, many of her original paintings adorn the walls of Planned Parenthood administrative headquarters in Tucson, the building that was named in her honor.\nPlanned Parenthood, in Arizona and nationwide, is currently under attack. Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to do away with Title X, a national program providing preventive health care to low-income patients; the fate of Title X is now in the Senate's hands. Since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed it into law, it has helped millions of women access services such as contraception, preventing an estimated 973,000 unintended pregnancies and 406,000 abortions every year.\nRep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), meanwhile, seeks to interfere with services covered by private insurance. By cutting off federal funds for insurance companies that cover abortions—even when the tax dollars aren't put toward abortion coverage—his bill would deny women the legal right to an abortion, guaranteed by the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. It would also impose tax penalties on those whose insurance offers such coverage.\nIn Arizona, families are facing further potential threats as the Republican-controlled Legislature introduced several anti-women's-health initiatives this year. HB 2384 would make Planned Parenthood newly ineligible for the Arizona Working Poor Tax Credit. HB 2416 would cause additional obstacles to abortion access, including changing the definition of \"surgical abortion\" to include abortion by pill, which could cut off rural women from abortion services. HB 2443 would infringe upon patient privacy by denying care to women who refuse to disclose the reasons behind their decision to abort.\nA century ago, Margaret Sanger witnessed tragedies that resulted from unintended pregnancies. In response, she illegally smuggled diaphragms into the country and opened family-planning clinics in defiance of the law—and spent time in jail for her troubles. This is the world Sanger and other birth-control activists came from, and it's the world lawmakers are trying to bring back.\nDon't stand for it. Talk to your friends; write to your representatives; vote; volunteer; and visit www.standwithplannedparenthood.org to show your support for Planned Parenthood's crucial work."

        "text": "The Las Vegas real estate market got a small reprieve in February; with sales volume at a four-year high for the month and a dip in foreclosure resales helping prices increase slightly from January. A total of 3,698 new and existing houses and condos were sold in the Las Vegas-Paradise metro area in February, according to MDA DataQuick. That’s up 9.8% from January and 10.5% from one year ago. A 5.7% increase from January to February is the average, dating back to 1994, DataQuick said. The February 2010 total was the highest for the month since 2006, when 6,065 homes were sold, but 2% below the 16-year average February sales total. It’s the 18th straight month that total sales rose year-over-year. Existing home sales totaled 3,311, up 7.1% from January and up 9.5% from last year. It’s the highest total for February existing sales since 2005. Existing home sales are on a 22-month-long run of monthly year-over-year increases. Foreclosure resales accounted for 59.6% of all resales in February, down from 62% in January and down from 70.6% last year. After peaking in April 2009 at 73.7%, foreclosure resales have declined every month. While foreclosure resales were down, foreclosure proceedings were up. In February, 1,756 homes and condos were foreclosed on in Las Vegas, up 5.3% from January, but down 52.8% from 3,718 foreclosures last year. New home sales totaled 387 in February, up 40% from January and up 20.2% from last year, but it was one of the slowest February sales totals in DataQuick’s 16 years of records, second only to last year. The decline in foreclosure resales and the increase in new home sales helped the median price increase from January, but only slightly. The median price paid for all new and resale houses and condos sold in the Las Vegas metro area in February was $126,197, up 0.4% from $125,750 in January but down 17.2% from $152,500 a year earlier. DataQuick said the year-over-year decline was the smallest since March 2008, when the median dropped 16% from a year earlier, to $247,925. In addition, sales of homes over $200,000 made up 22.4% of total sales, up from 21.3% in January but down from 30.8% a year earlier. The median sales price is on a 34-month-long run of monthly year-over-year declines and in February 2010, was 59.6% below the peak median of $312,000 in November 2006. The median price for single-family homes was $133,800 in February, down from $135,000 in January and down from $157,000 last year. The median condo sales price was $69,000, even from January, but down 9.2% from $76,000 last year. Nearly half — 49.8% — of borrowers that used mortgages to fund home purchases used government-backed Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans. Cash buyers accounted for 51.5% of all February sales, up from 50.4% in January. DataQuick defines cash borrowers as those purchases where there was no indication of a purchase mortgage recorded at the time of sale, but can include those that used alternative financing arrangements and in some cases borrowers might be taking out mortgages after their purchases. Absentee buyers, usually investors, but anyone who indicates at the time of sale that the property tax bill will go to a different address, accounted for 44.6% of all Las Vegas area home sales. However, house flipping declined. Homes sold in February that had previously sold in the past three weeks to six months accounted for 3.7% of all sales, down from 5% in January, but up from 2.6% last year. Write to Austin Kilgore."

He was batting.299 this year with 7 homers and 43 RBI.\nThroughout the last couple of seasons, Jesse Winker dealt with pain his right shoulder.\nAfter he felt more pain Monday, it was determined that Winker would need surgery to repair his shoulder. He will miss the remainder of the season.\nThe Reds placed Winker on the 10-day disabled list Thursday with a right shoulder subluxation.\n\"Man, I have no idea it is,\" said Winker. \"I know my shoulder hurts. That’s all I know.\"\nWinker said the pain was \"off and on\" all season but Monday was essentially the final straw.\nOn first base during a comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Winker ducked under a line-drive single from Tucker Barnhart in the ninth inning and fell to the ground on the base paths. Winker later scored the game-winning run.\nA potential Rookie of the Year candidate, Winker was batting.299 this season with seven homers and 43 RBI. The outfielder ranked fourth in the Majors with a.405 on-base percentage. He had more walks (49) than strikeouts (46).\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Winker was emotional about the end of his season.\n\"Obviously, I was hoping that surgery wasn’t the end result but I’ve been dealing with this for 2-3 years,\" Winker said. \"Just got to the point now where it’s time to go fix it.\"\nIt's a tough loss for the Reds' lineup, which was already without outfielder Scott Schebler. On the DL, Schebler began a rehab assignment Wednesday, going 1-for-3 with a walk as a designated hitter at Triple-A Louisville.\nWinker, based on what he's been told from doctors, said his goal is to return by Feb. 1, 2019. He said he felt the pain when he completed \"any baseball move.\"\n\"There were times where it affected his swing,\" Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman said. \"He altered his swing path because of the pain. That’s a tough way to play at the Major League level. He did a heck of a job. I don’t think anybody realized that he was going through it as much as he was.\"\nMason Williams, an outfielder at Louisville, was called up to fill Winker’s roster spot. Williams played in 25 games with the New York Yankees over the past three seasons.\nA left-handed hitter, Williams signed with the Reds as a minor league free agent last offseason.\nWilliams was batting.280 with six homers and 30 RBI in 87 games at Louisville. He recorded a hit in 13 of his last 14 games.\n\"It’s been a matter of me being healthy and staying on the field and playing my game and just having confidence in myself,\" Williams said.\nWilliams, once considered the Yankees' top prospect, learned of his promotion to the big leagues Thursday morning.\nHe played on the same high school team in Florida as Cardinals pitcher Austin Gomber, who had a no-hitter against the Reds for six innings Tuesday. The two players will sometimes train together in the offseason.\nTo make room on the 40-man roster for Williams, the Reds moved injured infielder Alex Blandino (torn ACL in his right knee) to the 60-day DL.\n\"He’s had productive at-bats, competitive at-bats, against both left-and-right-handed pitching,\" Riggleman said of Williams. \"He’s a good athlete. We’re confident he will come up here and do a good job.\"\nSCHEBLER STILL PROGRESSING: Schebler was in Louisville's lineup as a designated hitter for his second rehab game Thursday.\nBut the key to his return will be when he's comfortable making throws."

        "text": "Rafael Nadal became the first man to win eight titles at the same Grand Slam tournament after beating fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in the French Open final on Sunday.\nIf Rafael Nadal truly was going to be challenged, if his bid for an unprecedented eighth French Open championship would be slowed even a bit, this might have been the moment.\nLeading by a set and a break 70 minutes into Sunday's final against David Ferrer, another generally indefatigable Spaniard, Nadal faced four break points in one game. The last was a 31-stroke exchange, the match's longest, capped when Nadal absorbed Ferrer's strong backhand approach and transformed it into a cross-court backhand passing shot.\nFerrer glared at the ball as it flew past and landed in a corner, then smiled ruefully. What else was there to do? Dealing with Nadal's defence-to-offence on red clay is a thankless task. His rain-soaked 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Ferrer on was Nadal's record 59th win in 60 matches at the French Open and made him the only man with eight titles at any Grand Slam tournament.\n\"I never like to compare years, but it's true that this year means something very special for me,\" Nadal said, alluding to the way he managed to come back from a left knee injury that sidelined him for about seven months.\n\"When you have a period of time like I had,\" he added, \"you realize that you don't know if you will have the chance to be back here with this trophy another time.\"\nBut he does it, year after year.\nHe won four French Opens in a row from 2005-08, and another four in a row from 2010-13.\n\"Rafael was better than me,\" said Ferrer, who had won all 18 sets he'd played the past two weeks to reach his first Grand Slam final at age 31. \"He didn't make mistakes.\"\nA week past his 27th birthday, Nadal now owns 12 major trophies in all — including two from Wimbledon, one each from the U.S. Open and Australian Open — to eclipse Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver and equal Roy Emerson for the third-most in history. Nadal trails only Roger Federer's 17 and Pete Sampras' 14.\n\"Winning 17 Grand Slam titles, that's miles away,\" Nadal said with his typical humility. \"I'm not even thinking about it.\"\nThis was Nadal's first major tournament after a surprising second-round loss at Wimbledon last June. Since rejoining the tour in February, he is 43-2 with seven titles and two runner-up finishes. He's won his past 22 matches.\n\"For me, it's incredible,\" said Toni Nadal, Rafael's uncle and coach. \"When I think of all that Rafael has done, I don't understand it.\"\nLet's be plain: No one, perhaps not even Ferrer himself, expected Nadal to lose Sunday.\nThat's because of Nadal's skill on clay, in general, and at Roland Garros, in particular, but also because of how Ferrer had fared against his friend and countryman — and video-game competitor — in the past.\nFerrer entered Sunday 4-19 against Nadal. On clay, Nadal had 16 consecutive victories over Ferrer, whose only head-to-head win on the surface came the first time they played, in July 2004, when Nadal was 18.\nNadal had yet to make his French Open debut then, missing it that year because of a broken left foot. On May 23, 2005, Nadal played his first match at Roland Garros, beating Lars Burgsmuller 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-1 on Court 1, known as the \"bullring\" because of its oval shape.\nAnd so began the reign.\nNadal won a record 31 consecutive matches at the French Open until the fourth round in 2009, when Robin Soderling beat him. In 2010, Nadal started a new streak, which currently stands at 28.\nThere was occasional shakiness this year. Nadal lost the first set of each of his first two matches, and was pushed to a tiebreaker to begin his third. His fourth match, a straight-set win against No. 15 Kei Nishikori, \"was a major step forward,\" Nadal said. Still, he barely edged No. 1-ranked Novak Djokovic in a thrilling semifinal that lasted more than 4 1/2 hours and ended 9-7 in the fifth set Friday.\nBy any measure, that match was far more enjoyable to take in than the final, akin to dining on a filet mignon accompanied by a well-aged bottle of Bordeaux — each bite and sip rich, textured — one day, then grabbing a hot dog and can of soda from a street vendor 48 hours later.\nUnder a leaden sky that eventually would release a steady shower from the second set on, Ferrer felt nerves at the outset, he acknowledged later. But after the players traded early breaks, Ferrer held for a 3-2 lead.\nThat's when Nadal took over, winning seven games in a row and 12 of 14 to render the ultimate result pretty clear. It was as if he simply decided, \"Enough is enough.\" His court coverage was impeccable, as usual, showing no signs of any problems from that left knee, which was supported by a band of white tape. His lefty forehand whips were really on-target, accounting for 19 of his 35 winners and repeatedly forcing errors from Ferrer.\nWhen Nadal did have lapses, he admonished himself, once slapping his forehead with his right palm after pushing a lob wide. But what's demoralizing for opponents is the way Nadal slams the door when they have openings, then rushes through when he gets the slightest chance.\nHe was at his relentless best on key points, including those four break chances for Ferrer at 3-1 in the second set. Immediately after, Nadal broke to 5-1 on a forehand winner down the line.\nAs Nadal prepared to serve in the next game, a man wearing a white mask and carrying a fiery flare jumped out of the stands nearby. The intruder quickly was shoved to the ground by one security guard, while another went to protect Nadal.\n\"I felt a little bit scared at the first moment,\" Nadal said, \"because I didn't see what's going on.\"\nIt happened within a few minutes of other actions by protesters, including chanting from the upper deck that briefly delayed play. Police said seven people were held for questioning.\nNadal got broken in that game, then broke back right away to take the second set.\nThe third set was similar to the first. It was 3-all, then suddenly over. Nadal took the last three games, ending the match with a forehand winner before dropping his racket and falling on his back, leaving a rust-colored smudge on his white shirt and flecks of clay on his stubbled cheeks. Soon he was standing, holding his index finger aloft.\nYes, Nadal is No. 1 at the French Open, without a doubt. When the ATP rankings are issued Monday, however, he will be No. 5, due to points he dropped while hurt. Oddly enough, Ferrer will be at No. 4.\n\"Yeah, it's strange, no? I lost the final against Rafael, but tomorrow I am going to be No. 4 and him No. 5,\" Ferrer said with a grin, then delivered his punchline: \"I prefer to win here and to stay No. 5.\"\nSorry, David. This is Nadal's tournament.\nNow the question becomes: Is eight enough?"

Atlantic Ave. would be the first oceanfront condo project to be built in Southeast Volusia in six years.\nSt. Petersburg-based Eckall Development says it already has two reservations for condo units at Waterford.\nThe city’s planning board on Monday will consider a new site plan for the seven-story building that developers hope to begin building by the end of the year.\nCondo demand in New Smyrna Beach is on the rise.\nFrom March through June, condo sales rose 34 percent to 205 this year from 153 last year, according to the New Smyrna Beach Board of Realtors. The median sale price in June was $189,000, up 6 percent from $139,000 a year ago, but slightly down from $212,500 in April, the highest level in 1.5 years.\nA declining inventory is also fueling a rise in prices. The number of condos for sale in Southeast Volusia fell 22 percent to 462 in June, the lowest level in at least 4-1/2 years, from 594 a year ago.\nA Winter Park developer started building the proposed nine-story, 19-unit Vizcaya condo project in 2007, but abandoned the project the following year.\nThat left a development site where 193 pilings had already been pounded into the earth, a slab poured and blocks laid for the first-floor walls. The property has remained in that state ever since.\nEckall Development bought the property in December for $1.1 million, according to Volusia County property records. The existing infrastructure was tested and is sound, said Lee Allen, a company principal.\nAllen and Ken Eckelkamp, the founders of Eckall Development, say they are already familiar with Southeast Volusia having previously worked for JMC Communities, which built the 310-unit Minorca condo complex at the north tip of New Smyrna Beach between 2002 and 2007 and the 39-unit Seacrest condo complex in 2007 at 4071 S. Atlantic Ave. in New Smyrna Beach.\nThe last oceanfront condo started in the city was The Wave in 2007 at 2801 Hill St. The project was only 80 percent completed in 2008 when it was foreclosed and abandoned. Houston-based Silvestri Investments, which owns the Oceanwalk Condominiums in New Smyrna Beach, bought The Wave in late 2009, completed construction and has sold 10 of the 11 units.\nEckall Development needs to sell at least 11 units at Waterford before it can start construction, Allen said.\nThe company is offering six floor plans, including two penthouse units, each three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The units range in size from 1,845 square feet to 3,088 for a penthouse.\nPrices currently range from $700,000 to $1.6 million, but are expected to rise once construction starts, Collado said."

AI671 was taking off from Mumbai and reaching Chennai at 10.45 am every day from 1976.\nThe flight would leave for Madurai at 11.30 am. It was taking off from Madurai to reach Chennai at 2.15 pm. The decision was taken at a time when local passengers are demanding a direct service from Madurai to Mumbai.\n“Private airlines are operating as many as 16 services between Chennai and Madurai. But Air India claims that the flight has low patronage. How can a private player operate flights without patronage? Air India is making way for private airlines,” a regular passenger alleged.\nIt may be noted that Air India's was the only service that plied between Madurai and Mumbai. “Many traders were using the Air India flight to send their jasmines, vegetables and other agricultural products to Mumbai for years. Withdrawing the flight service will hurt traders and farmers of the southern districts,” the passenger added.\nSome passengers pointed out that all the tickets used to be sold out during the festive season and summer. “On normal days too, nearly 80 percent tickets were sold for the Air India flight. The claims of poor patronage made by the authorities are misleading,” they alleged.\nMeanwhile, union minister Pon. Radhakrishnan said that he would talk to the Civil Aviation Minister to operate the existing flight service and an additional flight between Madurai and Mumbai."

        "text": "It's not always easy to keep mentally focused during running. Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend. Be positive and encouraging and tell yourself that you can do it.\nWhen you feel yourself starting to tire or slow down, marathon runner and trainer Jeff Galloway suggests practicing the following drill, adapted from his book, \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated.\" Tell yourself that you're going to continue running for just one minute more, reducing your pace slightly for a few seconds, then continue this pattern, telling yourself \"one more minute\" or \"10 more steps\" until you achieve your goal for the day. If you break down your goal into small chunks, it may seem more manageable and achievable and you'll be less likely to lose focus.\nAlmost all athletes use some form of visualization prior to or during their workout or competition to help them stay focused. According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved. Before your race, you might lie down and imagine yourself running effortlessly, overcoming obstacles and achieving your goal. The more vividly you can imagine the scene by involving all of your five senses, the more effective your visualization will be."

        "text": "Initiated by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Nathan Twining and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, and then presided over by General Thomas Power, Director of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (1960-1964), SIOP-62 mapped out a synchronized nuclear attack by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Army combining strategic bombers, Polaris submarine-launched missiles and Atlas ICBMs in an ‘alert’ force of over 1,706 nuclear weapons and a ‘full’ force of over 3,240 nuclear weapons delivered to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China and allied states. In this Plan there was little or no distinction made between Communist states that were at war with the United States and those that were not. Some sites (Designated Ground Zeroes – DGZs) would be struck by two or more weapons, and included both military installations and urban-industrial areas. The alert force would target 199 cities and the full force would target 295.2 The planners estimated that the total human deaths from such an attack would be 108 million in the Soviet Union and 104 million in the PRC as well as several million in satellite states,3 while Kaplan estimated that 175 million Russians and Chinese would be killed by the ‘alert’ force and 285 million would be killed by a ‘full’ force, and an additional 40 million more injured.4 To make such threats credible, the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Energy (DoE) and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) conducted visible tests of new nuclear weapons in various atmospheric conditions in a twenty test series between 1946 and 1963. Even after the limited test ban treaty was adopted, they continued with underground tests.\nGeneral Thomas Power presided over the creation of SIOP-62 as Commander in Chief, Strategic Air Command (1957–1964) and Director, Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (1960–1964).\nAs nuclear intimidation continued, and as other nations sought to gain ‘parity’, the global nuclear industry grew. It was clearly understood in these early decades that the dual-use of nuclear materials in nuclear energy generation and nuclear weapons served to establish and maintain national influence in the international arena. Since 1945, the supply and procurement of uranium together with coal (for steel production) has been a good indicator of a nation’s capacity to both rapidly increase its energy production with the potential to produce munitions and, for those states already with the capacity, to produce and enhance a nuclear weapons arsenal. High-energy power generation was an index of a nation’s war-making potential underlining the link between mining and militarisation.\nIn the following I seek to explain why and how the Australian government in 2014 has concluded a uranium trade deal with India that is in breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by tracing the development of a nuclear nexus between India, Australia, Japan and the United States. Just as it was in the early cold war, this trade in nuclear materials is informed by interlocking and mutually reinforcing economic and geostrategic interests that have long undermined international disarmament initiatives. I argue that changing climatic conditions caused by emissions intensive energy production, however, demand a fundamental re-thinking of this paradigm.\nOf the 67 reactors under construction globally as of July 2014, at least 49 were experiencing delays and eight had been under construction for 20 or more years. China too, having planned before 2011 to replace heavy carbon emitting coal-fired power stations with nuclear power stations, stalled and re-assessed its position after 3.11.8 For the most part, China (along with the US, India and Germany) has boosted its renewable electricity generating capacity so that by 2013, it produced through wind, solar and hydro power over 1000 terawatt hours – the equivalent of the total power generation of France and Germany.9 In Japan, nearly four years after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns, 46 other nuclear reactors remain shut down. The Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) approved the restart of two reactors in Sendai, Kyushu on 10 September 2014 and Mayoral consent was secured in October.\nUntil 2014, along with China, Japan has also seen a boom in mostly solar and wind electricity generation. But this has been stalled by utilities who have refused to take an influx of renewable power into the grid or to reduce electricity prices.10 With fewer nuclear plants scheduled for construction around the world than for shutdown, however, the nuclear industry faces the likely prospect of contraction11 and replacement by rapidly advancing renewable energy options, including solar, wind, tidal, hydro and possibly geothermal power over the longer term.\nNew mining leases were approved in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales, and Queensland Premier Campbell Newman broke his electoral commitment not to permit uranium mining by inviting uranium mining companies to commence exploration operations. The new (Queensland) Mineral and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Bill 2014, for example, passed on 9 September 2014 authorizes a Coordinator General to overrule community objection rights to ‘State significant projects’ including coal, bauxite and uranium mines, or to limit them to concerns unrelated to environmental protection.13 This Act gives virtual immunity to large companies exploring for uranium deposits in the Mitchell and Alice River basins in Cape York and the Gulf country. Encouraged by these positive signs, along with other Japanese, Chinese and Indian investors in uranium projects in Australia, the major French energy corporation Areva recently bought a 51 percent share in a joint venture with Australian uranium miner Toro Energy for exploration in the Wiso Basin in Northern Territory.14 In other words, federal and state governments in Australia have been approving exploration licenses and the opening of uranium mines at a time when the global nuclear and uranium industry was marked by decline and exit.\nWhile some of the larger corporations chose to wait for uranium demand to rise, many in the Australian uranium mining industry scrambled to reprioritise, turning to the newly emerging market of nation-states tipped for rapid economic expansion. India attracted attention due to its high-growth economic potential, geostrategic positioning and nuclear ambitions. As then Prime Minister Howard had done in 2007, ‘energy starved’ India’s ‘power crisis’ is again being widely portrayed in desperate terms,15 while the solutions are presented as economic expansion and greater energy consumption by a growing middle class.16 In addition to coal exports, Australian politicians, in consultation with business representatives in the uranium and minerals sector, have framed the push for uranium trade with India as a ‘moral duty’ and ‘humanitarian responsibility’ to improve living standards of India’s impoverished people.\nOver the nearly four years since the Fukushima disaster, the Japanese government and corporations have actively courted more than 20 countries for the purchase of Japan’s nuclear technologies. Agreements had been reached with Jordan, Vietnam, South Korea and Russia under the Kan and Noda Democratic Party Japan (DPJ) governments, and the export of nuclear technology remained central to the Abe government’s economic plans. Two more nuclear technology agreements with Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have since been reached,19 and six more are under consideration – with India, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh. Despite the continuing negative effects of ongoing radioactive contamination dispersal from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, the Abe government remains intent both on nuclear startups in Japan and on promoting its exports of nuclear technology to other countries.\nA similar initiative followed on 5 September 2014, when Abbott and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed the Australia-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement in New Delhi. It was the culmination of the efforts initiated by the Howard government in 2006,22 carried forward by the Gillard government in 2011–2012.\nAfter India’s ‘Smiling Buddha’ Pokhran-I nuclear tests in May 1974, when the Indian government declared that it intended to harness nuclear energy to manufacture nuclear weapons, the Australian government (and many other countries including the US) placed a ban on exporting uranium to it (France and Russia continued to sporadically export uranium under a safety clause). India had built its clandestine nuclear weapons program using imported Canadian reactors.\nSince Nehru, India has justified its indigenous development of civil and military nuclear capacity and fuel and its refusal to ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by pointing to the nuclear weapons held by existing nuclear weapons states. It has argued that the NPT is a flawed agreement that reflects the hypocrisy of the nuclear weapons states in refusing to seriously engage in disarmament while expecting non-nuclear weapons states to abstain from possession. In 1975, partially in response to the Indian tests of the previous year, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) initially comprising seven nations (United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, Japan, France, Canada, West Germany) was formed to prevent the diversion of nuclear materials used for commercial and peaceful purposes for the production of nuclear weapons. NSG members were obliged to cease trade with governments that did not submit to international inspection. India and Pakistan were included. Despite the bans, India went ahead to conduct its Pokhran II nuclear tests in May 1998. These were followed by Pakistan’s tests two weeks later. UN Security Council Resolution 1172 of June 199823 expressed grave concern and demanded that both countries foreswear further tests and abandon their nuclear weapon ambitions.\nexpressed grave concern and demanded that both countries foreswear further tests and abandon their nuclear weapon ambitions.\nDespite the resolution’s unanimous adoption and threat of sanctions, the turning point was when the George W. Bush administration (2001-2009) chose to prioritize U.S. bilateral relations with India over any unified front to counter nuclear proliferation. The US–India energy agreement of July 2005 opened the way for other states, such as Australia, to engage bilaterally with India.\nMeanwhile in October 2008, the Singh government overcame stiff opposition in parliament to secure national and international backing for the signing of the US–India ‘1-2-3’ Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.This Agreement stipulated that India would open its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and delineate its civil and military facilities so as to ensure US-origin fuel would not be used for military purposes. In return the US would supply nuclear fuel and nuclear technologies (six reactors) and gain greater access to the Indian nuclear market.\nAs unanimous approval from the 48 states of the NSG was also required, the US and India lobbied hard and secured an unprecedented waiver of NSG export guidelines so as to permit nuclear commerce with India despite its non-NPT signatory status. Having granted the exception, several NSG members then negotiated bilateral nuclear accords with India (including France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Canada and Kazakhstan). In 2008 the Singh government purchased 300 MT of uranium ore concentrate from Areva of France, in 2009 2000 MT of uranium oxide pellets and 58 MT of enriched uranium dioxide from JSC Tvel/Russia, also in 2009 2100 MT of uranium dioxide concentrate from NAC/Kazakhstan and in 2013 2000 MT of uranium ore concentrate from NMMC Uzbekistan.27 While details are yet to be finalised, the deal with Australia in 2014 would secure for India a steady, reliable, high-grade uranium supply from the world’s largest known uranium deposits (its uranium resources are about 28 percent of the world total).\nWhile details are yet to be finalised, the deal with Australia in 2014 would secure for India a steady, reliable, high-grade uranium supply from the world’s largest known uranium deposits (its uranium resources are about 28 percent of the world total).\nIn November 2010, in a joint statement signed by US President Obama and Indian PM Singh, it was agreed that negotiations would begin between Nuclear Power Corporation India Ltd (NPCIL) and US nuclear energy companies in return for implementing India’s full membership of the NSG in a ‘phased manner’. India agreed to accommodate the demands of General Electric and Westinghouse, which sought strict adherence to the CSC31 by diluting the CLNDA to reduce both suppliers’ liability and the time period for exercising right of recourse in the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Rules 2011.32 The US-India Business Council, PM Modi and industry executives from the Nuclear Power Company of India Ltd. (NPCIL) also devised an insurance package to indemnify the American suppliers in the event of a nuclear accident for the maximum liability amount stipulated in the CLNDA (INR 1500 Crore/$250 million).33 This was to encourage US/Japan companies (among others) to collaborate in building new nuclear reactors to allow India to ‘achieve its full blown potential’.34 In short, India would take as close to full liability for nuclear accidents as possible in return for receiving the benefits of NPT and NSG membership without the full obligations expected of its members. In doing so, the integrity of the NPT was further compromised.\nGiven that Australia’s uranium mining and export accounts for less than 1 percent of its hundred billion dollar mineral export business (iron ore, bauxite, coal, copper, nickel etc),36 however, these decisions by Australian leaders risked significant political capital over what has been a highly contentious issue in Australia’s recent political history.\nthe NPT non-nuclear-weapon states agree never to acquire nuclear weapons in exchange for which the NPT nuclear-weapon states agree to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology and to pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals.\nNuclear weapons states have had the primary responsibility to ensure disarmament of their own arsenals so as to prevent nuclear non-proliferation among other states. The export controls regime of the NSG and enhanced verification measures of IAEA (International Atomic Energy Association) Additional Protocols are ostensibly to end every possible means to acquire nuclear weapons. While Article Four of the NPT provides ‘inalienable rights to every non-nuclear weapon state’ to pursue nuclear energy for power generation, India is neither a member of the NPT nor a Non-Nuclear Weapon State and there is no provision in the NPT which permits for signatories to form nuclear cooperation agreements with Non-NPT states.\nIndia quite rightly has pointed out the hypocritical approach of the nuclear weapons states in approaching the NPT regime. As the Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee stated in 2007, India was not an NPT signatory because it considers the regime to be not one of ‘universal, non-discriminatory verification and treatment’.37 In the same statement, Minister Mukherjee also claimed that India had an ‘impeccable record on non-proliferation… [was] a leading advocate of the elimination of all nuclear weapons… [and was an adherent] to the values of peace and non-violence’. India’s ‘impeccable track-record on non-proliferation’ was a catch phrase coined by President Bush in 2005,38 and reiterated by both PM Modi and PM Abbott in 2014.\nTreating India as an exceptional case and a de facto nuclear weapons state makes even more conspicuous the selective imposition of sanctions or favour upon other non-NPT signatory nuclear weapons states such as Pakistan and Israel, or NPT signatory non-nuclear weapons states such as Iran.39 But the self-interested and strategically motivated application of the NPT was not new, nor was it limited to the US and its allies. The Soviet Union supplied China with the necessary technologies and skills to develop its own nuclear weapons capabilities, as China then supplied Pakistan. In turn, Pakistan also supplied other states that aspire to obtain nuclear capabilities. All were in a chain reaction, however, to U.S. threats to China and ultimately to the Soviet Union, in the early decades of the Cold War. While it is debatable that uranium and nuclear technology supply to India by others might serve to deter contemporary Chinese or Pakistani nuclear aggression, it has not served to prevent Indian conflicts with either of those two nations in the past. In any case, the use of nuclear trade as a strategic instrument does not ensure greater security or stability of the international community broadly defined, and this sort of leverage is not a valid use of the NPT.\nSo despite PM Abbott’s assurances that ‘suitable safeguards’ were in place to guarantee that Australian uranium would be used for ‘peaceful purposes’ and for ‘civilian use only’, as the former Director General of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office John Carlson points out, the Agreement departs from two principles of Australia’s 1987 Safeguards Act (section 51):40 the acquirement of ‘consent to reprocessing’ from the Australian government prior to the separation of plutonium from spent fuel; and the ‘right of return’ of nuclear materials supplied in the event of a breach of the agreement.41 Instead, the Agreement defers to the US-India nuclear cooperation agreement in which India would reprocess in facilities built with the assistance of US companies, and leaves open the question of how separated plutonium would be used or how arbitration would apply to settle disputes.\nTen of India’s twenty nuclear facilities are beyond the regulatory authority of the IAEA and India only selectively recognises IAEA safeguards for specific foreign supplied reactors and facilities. India also refuses to submit to suppliers inventory reports and accounting processes for nuclear material flowing through the nuclear cycle. As the IAEA is not able to fully inspect India’s dual-purpose (civilian and military) indigenous reactors and facilities for reprocessing, enrichment, retransfers to third countries, research and development or the production of tritium (used as a trigger for weapons), India is not fully accountable to either the IAEA or the supplier nation with which it has a bilateral agreement with in-built IAEA norms.\nSo even if India adheres to Australia’s requirements that its uranium be used solely to supply civil nuclear reactors for electricity generation that may be inspected by IAEA as per the nuclear safeguards agreement, Australia’s (or any other NPT members’) uranium export to India effectively supplements or liberates limited supplies of Indian uranium for military uses.42 Nor could, in the unlikely discovery of the ‘misallocation’ of some Australian origin uranium toward military use, the IAEA force compliance. In fact, whether or not India accounts for the flows of Australian material in its nuclear fuel cycle, it is impossible to verify whether it has actually adhered to the safeguards.\nAustralian Minister for Resources and Energy Martin Ferguson, Adani group founder Gautam Adani, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman in India in 2012.\nAs has been recommended by the United Nations (UN), World Health Organisation (WHO), International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), and recognised by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, the rapid phase out of coal-fired power stations is essential if the world is to meet the now seemingly optimistic carbon emissions reductions necessary to keep planetary warming below 2 percent of pre-industrialisation levels.46 While two hundred licenses for coal-fired power stations have been revoked by the Supreme Court of India recently, many Indian overseas coal projects are still underway.\nThere are a number of flaws underpinning the logic of this activity between political leaders and nuclear industry executives. PM Abbott insisted at the time of signing the nuclear deal with India that the Agreement would be safe. In fact, the Abbott government has committed to selling uranium to an ambitious nation that barely conceals its intentions to expand its nuclear weapons arsenal and has refused to become a full signatory to the NPT and, along with the US, China and Pakistan, has not ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nPrime Minister Modi is a pro-business politician and hardliner on Pakistan and Muslim populations in India and favours a security policy based on nuclear deterrence. The BJP holds a commanding majority in the lower house of Parliament. There is little reason to assume that Indian relations with Pakistan – or indeed with China – will soften by furnishing India with greater means to project its military power in the region. The surge of fundamentalist and jingoist forces in South Asia and rising military budgets and tensions between India and Pakistan on the one hand and China and the US, Japan and its allies on the other, aggravate the security situation in the region. Further, India has been waging an on-going long-term campaign against an insurgency within its borders, and it cannot guarantee against theft of nuclear-related materials.\nFourth, the option of nuclear power as the ‘clean’ alternative is nothing of the sort. Although the fission operation of nuclear power stations may be ‘cleaner’ than coal-fired power stations in terms of carbon emissions, and although the heat from fission may produce more energy and less waste per volume of uranium than coal, many problems remain unresolved. These include the safe storage of long-lived nuclear waste, long build time of reactors in proportion to rapidly accelerating effects of climate change, enormous financial costs, use and contamination of vital resources required across the nuclear cycle from mining to waste production (including water and fossil fuels),55centralised monopolisation of power management necessitated by nuclear power generation, excess heating of the atmosphere through the discharge of excess heat through water and air, danger to ecologies downwind or downstream from venting while refueling reactors, and increased potential for large-scale and long-term damage from accidents.\nGiven the advances of wind, solar, tidal and geothermal energy production which have become cheaper and more productive, as field-tested in China, Germany,56 Spain and other countries, and the abundance of these sources of energy in countries like Australia, the myth of base-load power is less sustainable than it was in the heady renaissance days. India’s pitch to rapidly increase economic growth has been embraced by the transnational nuclear industry as it represents an opportunity to expand the nuclear industry, and an opportunity to diversify from reliance on the Chinese market. But when typical cost-benefit analyses are extended to include the actual costs of the above-mentioned scenarios (nuclear weapons exchange, public health effects from industrial pollution from uranium mining and nuclear reactors, nuclear reactor disasters, nuclear waste storage, renewable energy alternatives), in an already fragile ecology in India, India’s nuclear energy plan reflects neither deep commitment to climate change mitigation nor serious concern for India’s impoverished populations.\nWhy does the Australian, Indian, the United States and Japanese governments (among others) and their affiliated transnational corporations, continue to accelerate nuclear related operations despite these significant obstacles?\nIt is unlikely that the Japan-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement went unsigned because of any putative scruple Japan may have about selling nuclear technologies to India as a non-NPT nuclear weapons state. As the Modi and NPCIL accommodation of American supplier demands demonstrates, the liability clause can be flexible. It remains unlikely, however, that India will consent to opening all of its reactors for inspection.60 Rather, it is likely that Japan is awaiting an American executive decision on the liability issue and the possible inclusion of India into the NPT as a nuclear weapons state, since prior agreement would appear to abrogate Japan’s NPT obligations.\nThat PM Modi reasserted India’s customary ‘no first use’ policy does not mean that he does not intend to stockpile and bolster India’s nuclear arsenal. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that India possesses 90 to 110 nuclear weapons.61 In June 2014, the IHS (Information Handling Service) Jane’s military research group identified what they believe to be a new uranium hexafluoride (enrichment) facility at the Indian Rare Metals Plant near Mysore. As with its other military plants, this plant is not within IAEA safeguards. Estimated to be operational by mid-2015, it would produce roughly double the amount of enriched fuel (160 kilos a year enriched to 90 percent purity) required for India’s ballistic missile nuclear submarine fleet.62 The IHS analysts surmise that the surplus could be used for thermonuclear weapons (mixing enriched uranium and plutonium stockpiles).63 It could also be used to fuel nuclear submarines, space satellites, tactical and intermediate ballistic missiles, and multiple warhead Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (Agni V ICBM MIRVs) with the ability to reach cities in China and Pakistan. India joins the US, Russia, UK, France and China in possessing the ICBM with MIRV, leaving Pakistan further behind in terms of weapons parity, particularly in navy, air and ground forces, and missile capabilities.64 As India seeks to rival China, it could further destabilize relations with Pakistan by intensifying the ongoing arms race between the two. Regional tensions could be further exacerbated by Pakistan’s border skirmishes with Afghanistan and Iran over its support of the Taliban in Afghanistan.65 Along with increasing tensions involving US-Japan-India and China, this is precisely the scenario that NPT members have tried to avoid by subscribing to IAEA safeguards.\nSince the late 1950s, there have been elements in the Japanese government (led by Abe’s grandfather and former Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke) who have advocated the procurement of tactical nuclear weapons as an entitlement under the nation’s right to self-defence as stipulated in the UN Charter. Although the US has long discouraged Japan’s nuclear weaponisation with assurances of extended nuclear deterrence, in 2003 US Vice-President Cheney stated that Japan’s possession of nuclear weapons could be tenable if it were aligned to US strategic deterrence policy.68 As an NPT signatory, Japan has accumulated the fourth largest stockpile of ‘civilian’ plutonium, the largest stockpile of any non-nuclear weapons state.69 Despite reprocessing programs having been closed down by many other countries, Japan claims that its significant nuclear reprocessing and fuel fabrication program is for ‘energy autonomy’ by which it means ‘closing the nuclear fuel cycle’. This relies upon the ability to separate plutonium from spent fuel and reprocess and fabricate it ‘upwards’ so as to produce more plutonium than is consumed, thereby facilitating an endless loop of fuel production and consumption. In this scenario, the Japanese government regards spent nuclear fuel and stockpiled plutonium as an ‘asset’ rather than a ‘debt’.\nThis ability should not be understood as solely for the reduction of reliance on foreign fuel imports or even of nuclear waste. In 2009, Ernest J. Moniz, an MIT professor and United States Secretary of Energy in 2014, admitted that uranium, once thought to be scarce, was now so abundant as to raise doubt over the necessity for nuclear fuel reprocessing.70 As of March 2011, despite the recommendations by the Japan Atomic Energy Commission and the Science Council of Japan of both direct disposal and limited surface storage of spent nuclear fuel in dry casks over fuel pool storage and reprocessing, the Japanese government would not rule out the reprocessing option. If the closed fuel cycle ever did eventuate, it would negate Japan’s dependence on the import of vital energy resources (uranium, oil, natural gas) so as to achieve ‘energy autonomy’. This would drastically reduce fuel costs and would also reduce vulnerability to sanctions should Japan breach the NPT (or other international agreements) in its decision to ‘go nuclear’.\nJapan’s long-term investment in co-developing this high-level technical capability has made it the second most powerful missile power in the world, and the only nation outside the US with both low and upper-tier defences reputedly capable of intercepting missiles beyond the Earth’s atmosphere.72 Given this long-term commitment, it was not surprising that the Abe government in 2013 decided to declare the constitutional right to participate in ‘collective security’ operations with the US and other allies.\nThis technology, and Japan’s ambiguous intentions concerning nuclear and space weaponisation, means that the US and Japan, in collaboration with partners such as Australia and India (in sea-going operations in particular), could potentially integrate not only their BMD systems but also their nuclearized capabilities. As South Korea and Taiwan have also expressed interest in reprocessing their spent nuclear fuel (as have other states such as Saudi Arabia), these developments carry strong potential for proliferation.\nOne of the major implications of this distributed form of ‘self-defence’ is that US Pacific Command would further extend the pre-emptive strike capacity of its global nuclear strike force. With Japan’s recent release of space assets for military use (reconnaissance, communications, navigation, early warning) in collaboration with the US, this further augments the current period of US ‘nuclear primacy’ and a return to the conditions prior to 1963 when the Soviets had developed long-range bombers to deliver their nuclear payloads over US territory. Nuclear primacy transcends the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction in its ability to win a nuclear war, which the US is proposing to do by eliminating retaliatory capability with a single massive attack called ‘Prompt Global Strike’.\nUnder the Australia–India uranium trade agreement, India will use Australian yellow cake to diversify its nuclear program. If and when the Japan–India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement is concluded, it will supply the nuclear technology India requires to build its industrial capacity and indirectly enhance its nuclear arsenal. Negotiated almost simultaneously and in coordination, both of these Agreements, together with and following the US–India nuclear agreement, tacitly legitimise India’s nuclear status and assist in its ambitions for greater international influence. Australia and Japan, both NPT and NSG members, have become complicit in India’s nuclear weapons program and partially responsible for increasing the risk of nuclear accident in India, and for potentially aggravating nuclear rivalry in Asia.\nIndia claims to need more electricity for domestic and industrial growth as well as to lift a significant population out of poverty. Yet there are many factors which create the conditions for the advance of India’s poor, just as there are many forms of alternative energy generation beyond nuclear and coal which would be safer, more reliable and powerful if given comparable investment and with smart power grid distribution networks.76 To the extent that governments and corporations continue to invest in nuclear power construction and reprocessing as a source of ‘renewable energy’, they diminish the potential to stem the destructive and exponentially increasing effects of climate change.77 China, Germany, the United States, India and even Japan are presently leading the world in investing in renewable energy technology. Yet, with the exception of Germany, this is being done in parallel with plans to expand nuclear power production.\nThe ongoing contamination from radiation dispersed from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant came, in part, from Australian uranium.78 When the benefits of uranium trade are weighed against the potential and actual costs and damages from uranium mining, the actual risks of nuclear reactor accidents and mismanagement, the decline in costs and advances in renewable technologies, potential nuclear weapons use (broadly defined) and proliferation, and the steady production of nuclear waste, it becomes clear that state-corporate policies to expand the industry are ill-conceived.\nIn 2014, as in 1945 and throughout the intervening decades, uranium mining, nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons remain ineluctably tied to the formation of a global power structure of nation-states and transnational corporations and instrumental in their overarching ambitions.\nAdam Broinowski is an ARC postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Pacific and Asian History, College of Asia and the Pacific, The Australian National University.

Despite warnings from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and UNESCO that this will place it ‘in danger’, plans to dredge and dump about 3 million cubic metres of the Reef into a wetlands sanctuary to make way for port expansions for 480 additional ships to access 330 million tonnes of coal per year from this mega-mine will use 12 billion litres of fresh water per year and will affect the habitat of humpback whales, sea turtles and dugongs. With 130 million tonnes of carbon dioxide produced every year for ninety years, this will cancel out the Queensland Direct Action target of 131 million tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction. Adani Enterprises has a dubious track record including illegal large-scale exports of iron ore at its port and numerous cases of environmental pollution. It has also been a significant supporter of the Bharatiya Janta Party. Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Citi, Morgan Stanley and possible JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have refused to fund the project while the ‘big four’ Australian banks seem to be giving their approval. India is the third largest producer, consumer and importer of coal in the world and the fourth largest energy consumer in the world.

This is what the international community has recognised as the upper limit of safety. Beyond 2 degrees, the consequences will be unpredictable, highly dangerous and perhaps irreversible’. See, United Nations, ‘Secretary-General’s remarks at Climate Leaders Summit’, 11 April 2014. It is estimated that at least two thirds of proven fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground and that carbon utilities and infrastructure must be developed beyond 2017 as 80 percent of cumulative emissions allowable between 2010 and 2035 are already locked into existing power plants, factories, buildings and services. In addition this will result in significant positive in health effects, job production, biodiversity conservation, energy independence and stronger sovereignty and resilience. Although several countries have moved to end public finance for coal and other fossil fuels, Australia has yet to do so in a significant manner.

This was supported by a study in 2004 by Koide Hiroaki who found the level to be 10mSv/y around the mine and over 1 mSv/y in the villages. The UCIL managers have used the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle to set permissible radiation exposure limits and precautionary measures and have shown disregard for the conditions of indigenous peoples living in the area.

India conducted successful tests of the 5,000-km Agni-V, India’s first ICBM. Along with its shorter-range Prithvi missiles, India’s 2,000-km K-4 SLBM and its Agni-I (700-km), Agni-II (2,000-km) and Agni-III (3,000-km) missiles were tested under Strategic Forces Command in March 2014.

        "text": "Amazingly, half of all Americans say they don’t care about government surveillance — and during a random sampling of people on the streets of New York City not one could identify Edward Snowden, or what he did.\nThat’s despite an Academy Award winning documentary on his release of classified documents about the spying activities of a National Security Agency called Citizenfour.\nThe government is collecting data from you all the time. From your phone, computer, tablet, credit cards, travel records and more. We know they are doing this because of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nJohn Oliver traveled to Moscow where Snowden, wanted by the U.S government, has asylum for the next three years. There he interviewed Snowden in an attempt to find out why more Americans don’t care about the government spying on their personal lives.\nBased on Snowden’s explanation of the government’s spying activities, here are five basic questions every American should ask themselves about the NSA surveillance program.\n1. Do you want the government to collect your data (including your naked pictures)?\nAccording to Oliver, Pew Research found that 46 percent of Americans say they don’t care about government surveillance. Why? It’s too complicated and technical to try to trace the life cycle of a text message. Hilariously Oliver tries to put the issue into terms Americans will care about — whether or not the government has access to your naked pictures. Once everyday folks heard the argument in those terms, they got interested in the debate pretty fast.\n“I did this [released secret NSA spying information] to give the American people the chance to decide for themselves what kind of government they want to have,” Snowden tells Oliver.\nDo you want a government that hoards your most scandalous communications?\n2. Why did the government lie about its spying activity?\nOn June 1, 2015, key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire, including the controversial Section 215 provision, which has been interpreted by a FISA Court to mean that the government has the authority to collect comprehensive data on its citizens.\nPrior to the Snowden revelations about programs like PRISM, American government officials — including President Obama — said the government was collecting only basic phone and internet records, like when a call was made and to whom (metadata), rather than the actual content of the conversation. Snowden proved that’s just not true.\nThe Snowden documents showed that the government was collecting and storing the content of Americans’ communications too, like emails, phone calls, internet searches and text and chat messages, rather than just basic call record information.\nWorse yet, it’s not just being looked at; it’s being stored in monster government data centers in Utah, in case it needs to be looked at in the future. So if you want to play a semantics game, they aren’t actively looking at it, just saving a copy in case they need to later. Does that make you feel any better about it?\n3. Can you trust the government with this kind of power?\nMobile phone data provides an incredibly detailed account of your life — your location, who you call, emails, text messages, internet searches, online shopping habits. Combine that level of detailed data contained in your credit card records, home and work emails and internet searches, and that’s a pretty freaky accurate representation of who you are, where you’ve been, with whom and what you were doing. But not totally accurate.\nYour phone data might put you in a mall food court at the same time as a terrorist, but does that mean you’re a terrorist too? What if you just both happen to love Orange Julius and soft pretzels?\nNow, imagine in the future the government charges you with a crime. Any crime, really. Doesn’t matter which. For belonging to the wrong religion. For being too friendly with someone the government doesn’t like. Happens all the time around the world. Rather than the government having to collect evidence about your crime to prove your guilt, it’ll already have a pile of information on you it can use however it chooses. No warrant. Nada.\nWe might be cool with all of this surveillance capability being used against the terrorists, but what if it’s turned on Americans one day?\nSo do you trust them?\n4. How do we balance privacy and safety?\nThe Patriot Act was conceived amidst the fear following the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. But even one of the primary authors of the Patriot Act, Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, testified that the legislation was never intended to authorize the bulk collection and storage of the communications of U.S. citizens and that its powers should be reined in when the Patriot Act is reauthorized this summer.\nGovernment officials argue that this kind of surveillance is critical for fighting terrorists and those who would do America and Americans harm. That sounds totally reasonable and fair. But with programs like PRISM and other surveillance activity Americans have no idea is going on, how can we have a debate and balance the idea of security against the idea of liberty?\nHow much privacy are we willing to give up for less security risk?\n5. Are you on a watch list?\nAt the end of the interview, Snowden gives John Oliver a pretty ominous warning — that by interviewing him, Oliver is likely now on a very serious, very scary U.S. government watch list. The idea of a watch list is discussed in more frightening detail in the Academy Award-winning documentary about Snowden, Citizenfour.\nAmericans are put on watch lists all the time, which brings increased scrutiny of communications, increased surveillance and, when traveling out of the country, often problems getting your passport cleared across international borders without intense questioning. But how do you know if you’ve done something to raise the government’s suspicions about your activity? Am I on a watch list just for writing this article? Are you for reading it? How would we know? It’s a secret.\nThe principles of transparency and checks and balances the U.S. government is founded on demand that citizens be informed about these kinds of government activities. Whether you view Snowden as a hero or a traitor, as he says, now you know what your government is doing in our name. Do you care? Does it bother you? We should be allowed to have this debate and make an informed decision one way or the other.\nIn the meantime, John Oliver and his team of brillant writers have distilled the argument down to this: Do you want the government to have a picture of you naked?"

        "text": "New York’s bike share really does attract way more commuters than tourists.\nSince its debut last year, New York City’s bike share system, Citi Bike, has been wildly popular. In its first six months of operation, the bright blue bikes logged more than 5 million trips. The system has nearly 100,000 annual members. Yet Citi Bike–which unlike most bike shares in major cities, isn’t subsidized by public funds–is losing money. One of the main reasons is that while annual memberships are popular, the much more profitable day passes aren’t. It’s a phenomenon easily seen in this visualization of two days of Citi Bike rides around New York City.\nDesigner Jeff Ferzoco, Sarah Kaufman at New York University’s Rudin Center for Transportation and Juan Francisco Saldarriaga of Columbia University’s Spatial Information Design Lab worked together to visualize Citi Bike journey data from September 17 and 18 of last year. Over those two days, when the weather was in the 60s and there was no rain, Citi Bike saw 75,000 rides. Rides are separated by type of membership, either annual (blue) or casual (yellow).\nThe visualization doesn’t show exact routes along the city’s grid, but instead approximates trips by tracing straight lines between the endpoints. Ridership picks up early in the morning, around 5:30 a.m., and is heavy between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Almost all of those riders are annual members. Yellow dots are barely visible on the map, except a few around the very lower tip of Manhattan and up near Central Park. As the day wears on, there’s a slight increase in casual members–people riding over the Brooklyn Bridge, for instance–but for the most part, the vast majority of the map is the blue. During the evening rush hours, when commuters get back on a Citi Bike to go home, the map is overwhelmed by a dense network of blue.\nInterestingly, more riders seem to take Citi Bike during the evening hours than take it to work. The number of active riders hits 800 at 8:30 a.m., but spikes to more than 1,000 at 6 p.m.\nThough the balance of ridership clearly tips in favor of annual membership, it would be interesting to compare this data to a weekend. Perhaps more people are willing to grab a daily pass on a Saturday than during the workweek."

        "text": "It’s amazing what a difference time can make in the way we perceive certain technologies. A few years ago, the idea of the cloud was terrifying to many people. What exactly did it mean to have something “in the cloud”? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information “in the cloud,” but it’s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB’s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that’s not always the case. A lot of cloud providers are focused on helping enterprises rather than SMBs. Luckily, there are some cloud providers that cater specifically to SMB customers.\nIf you’d like to learn more about SMB cloud migrations and how to choose the right cloud provider to meet your company’s needs, be sure to register for the upcoming webinar titled “How to Know if Your Cloud Decision is Right for Your SMB.” The webinar, presented by Ed Dryer, senior technology strategist at Steadfast, will take place on Tuesday, August 22, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. EDT.\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of public, hybrid and private clouds for SMBs; learn the operational and cost benefits of virtualization; hear what is driving SMBs today to make cloud investments; and understand how cloud services complement business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) services, managed security, and on-demand infrastructure. If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, you can REGISTER HERE."

        "text": "On Jan. 15, nine of 12 members of the National Park System Advisory Board sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announcing their resignation, effectively dissolving the board.\nIt was an act of protest against an administration with little appetite for the methodical approach the board has brought to national park management for decades. And it leaves the National Park Service without a means to establish new historic or natural landmarks, since federal law requires the advisory board to sign off on such designations. More significantly, perhaps, it’s another crack in the foundation of the Interior Department, which manages 500 million acres of public land and is already rattled by the prospect of some 4,000 job cuts.\nSince 1935, the nonpartisan experts on the National Park System Advisory Board have consulted with the Park Service on its policies and recommended new park units. Lady Bird Johnson served on the board, as did Western writer Wallace Stegner and numerous anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists, architects and social scientists. In recent years, the board has taken a special interest in protecting sites that are of value to Asian-American, African-American, Latino and LGBT communities, and it’s advised the Park Service on management strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nWhen Zinke took office last spring, board members hoped to talk with him about these efforts. But the secretary seemed uninterested—perhaps not surprising, given that a leaked document outlining his department’s priorities scrubbed all mentions of climate change and diversity. In May, Zinke suspended the advisory board, along with some 200 other independent committees that offered management expertise to individual parks or regions. With few options to make their voices heard, advisory board members decided to resign en masse.\nInterior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not respond to a request for comment, but told the conservative Washington Examiner that the department “welcomes” the resignations of members who she claims ignored sexual harassment issues in the Park Service.\nFormer Alaska governor and advisory board chairman Tony Knowles says sexual harassment didn’t fall under the board’s purview. He also talked with High Country News about why he quit and what the board’s dissolution means for the national park system. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nHCN: Did you get the sense that until this year, the recommendations of the board were heeded, or at least heard?\nTony Knowles: Yes, absolutely. Over the past 7 years, we really made a difference in the direction of the National Park Service. There was a great sense of collaboration. Our board members worked with more than 160 outside experts to come up with recommendations, including to approve 130 new historical landmarks. We went over recommendations carefully with former superintendent Jon Jarvis, and often they became part of Park Service policy.\nHCN: How did that change in the past year?\nTK: At the beginning, we were told that all of the advisory boards were suspended and we’d be notified when it would become part of the agenda to reinstate them. So we waited one, two, three, four months. There was no contract (to allow us to continue our work), no understanding of when a Park Service director would be appointed. In early October, I wrote a letter to Secretary Zinke explaining how the board wanted to meet to inform the new administration of what we envisioned to build a better park system in the 21st century, and to hear what their vision was. We got no answer. I pestered and pestered, and in mid-November got a one-sentence email from someone saying the secretary was very busy. That’s when we realized they were just running out the clock until our terms expired in May.\nHCN: Why did you decide to resign rather than try to influence the direction of the agency from within?\nTK: When you’re on permanent hold, at some time you’ve gotta hang up. There’s no one to talk to but yourselves. By nine of us resigning, we felt we’d be able to get the microphone briefly to at least talk to the American people about climate change, about preserving the natural diversity of wildlife, about making sure underrepresented minorities not only come to the parks but are employees there. All these things we think are important. We may be disappointed with the Department of the Interior, but we are not discouraged. Every single one of us will continue the fight to promote and protect our public lands.\nHCN: Given that your action is part of a larger pattern of resignations and layoffs at the Park Service, are you concerned about the agency’s future?\nTK: Of course we’re concerned. The secretary proposed a 13 percent budget reduction, which would all come out of personnel, then claimed he’s going to rebuild infrastructure by raising park entry fees. If we’re trying to increase the number of people from lower-income groups who want to come to our parks, that’s counter-productive. I also get worried when I think about the unprecedented reduction of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah. We think those could be a preview of coming attractions for the National Park Service."

You could wear it in a pair of glasses. Or in a stupid helmet.\nThe company sees two avenues for such technology: the glasses are an entertainment possibility, while the helmet, being the more heavyweight solution of the pair (including the same display tech but with an accompanying headpiece), could be used for gaming or more practical uses like aviation.\nHow would the glasses work? It's proposed in a patent that to get around the problem of the human eye being unable to focus on objects so close, it would distort to appear as though it was 21 inches away. The glasses could also adjust their transparency depending on the use's tastes or a game's needs, so you could black everything out and just focus on the action, or conversely use the specs as augmented reality devices able to overlay imagery onto the real world.\nSounds crazy at first, but then, the future always does.\nRemember, standard patent disclaimers apply: just because a company is researching stuff like this doesn't mean it'll ever come to market, etc etc.\nFor Plunkett, this is a pretty impressive piece!\nThis \"use's tastes\" do not include articles by this clown.\nThis has good real world application the HUD in aircraft and other uses like driving get a gps/HUD for road speeds an signs etc.\nAm I the only one who thought of this? http://www.1up.com/features/untitled_25 I so wanted the Nintendo Revolution to be that, It reminded me of a case study I did with a mate back in Uni on AR."

        "text": "Viewers will not want to miss Friday’s episode of General Hospital. Spoilers tease that everybody will see lots of juicy scenes revolving around the Lulu and Ryan storyline and the January 25 show will seemingly set fans up for a big surprise next week, too.\nAs Friday’s show begins, General Hospital spoilers indicate that Lulu will remain unconscious after the attack and her emergency surgery. The sneak peek shared via Twitter details that Laura will be by her daughter’s bedside, begging her to wake up. In addition, Lulu’s father-in-law, Sonny, will pay a visit to her as well.\nWhile it sounds as if Lulu will face a lengthy, difficult recovery, General Hospital spoilers suggest that she might peek her eyes open during Friday’s show. Even if she does start to regain consciousness, viewers should be prepared to learn that she won’t be able to share any bombshells about her attacker at this point.\nElsewhere in General Hospital, spoilers suggest that Ryan will be finding out whether his sight has been restored. SheKnows Soaps notes that Ava will be by Ryan’s side — and it sounds as if he probably will be able to see again. Next week, it’s said that he’ll try to finish the job he started with Lulu.\nAcross town, General Hospital spoilers reveal that Jordan will talk with Anna about the case. Jordan had wanted to grill Peter about where he was prior to the attack on Lulu, and naturally, Anna was quite concerned about this. It looks as if Jordan will share some in-depth information with Anna about what they know about the attacks so far — and Anna will be getting some answers about something.\nDuring Thursday’s episode, Jason and Sam finally made love again. As the Inquisitr previously detailed, Jason and Sam will be fully together going forward, although they will try to keep this development under the radar for the most part. During Friday’s show, however, it seems that Sam will voice some anxiety about what happens when Jason leaves her place.\nJason will promise Sam that things are different now. He was patient in waiting for her to decide what she wanted — and when she was ready to move forward — but he’s all-in when it comes to being reunited with his love. While Sam might feel anxious, he’ll promise that he’s coming back.\nFans always love to see Tristan Rogers pop up as Robert, and they’re in for a treat heading into the February sweeps. Rogers is back beginning with Friday’s show — and General Hospital spoilers hint that soon Robert and Finn will be working together to figure out how Anna was infected with the virus.\nFranco and Elizabeth will further discuss the situation with Aiden, and the possibility that he’s gay. All signs point toward the couple reaching out and doing their best to support the little boy during this journey. The next show will also have some scenes involving Maxie and Peter as a relationship continues to slowly evolve between the two.\nThere are a lot of questions remaining regarding what happens next with Ryan and this case. General Hospital spoilers hint that there may be at least one more victim before he’s caught and he’ll seemingly go to great lengths to avoid detection. Don’t miss any of the drama coming up with Friday’s show, and stay tuned for additional teasers regarding what’s coming next."

        "text": "Tue., May 29, 2018, 10:20 a.m.\nCAGUAS, Puerto Rico – At least 4,645 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria and its devastation across Puerto Rico last year, according to a new Harvard study released Tuesday, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll, which stands at 64.\nThe official death estimates have drawn sharp criticism from experts and local residents, and the new study criticized Puerto Rico’s methods for counting the dead – and its lack of transparency in sharing information – as detrimental to planning for future natural disasters. The authors called for patients, communities and doctors to develop contingency plans for natural disasters.\nMore than eight months after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the island’s slow recovery has been marked by a persistent lack of water, a faltering power grid and a lack of essential services – all of which have imperiled the lives of many residents who have been struggling to get back on their feet, especially the infirm and those in remote areas, some of which were the hardest hit in September.\nMiliana Montanez cradled her mother’s head as she lay dying on the floor of her bedroom here in Caguas, gasping for air and pleading for help.\nLeon’s eyes bulged in terror as she described to her daughter the tiny points of light that appeared before her eyes moments before it was all over. She took one last exasperated gulp of air. That’s when paramedics arrived. Far too late.\nLeon’s death reverberated through her family and her community. Her son, a college student in a town two hours away, sees no point in coming home anymore. Her husband is withdrawn and is close to losing his job. Her daughter struggles to understand what happened as she fights off despair and anger recalling all the chaos that revolved around Leon’s last moments on the floor of her home.\nPuerto Rico’s government faced immediate scrutiny after initially reporting that 16 people had died as a result of the storm, which strafed much of the island on Sept. 20. That number more than doubled after President Donald Trump visited in October, when he specifically noted the low death toll. The number kept rising until early December, when authorities said 64 had died.\nThe official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital – only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.\nThe new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government’s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.\nGov. Ricardo Rossells’s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.\nAfter pressure from Congress and statistical analyses from news organizations that put the death toll at higher than 1,000, Rossells enlisted the help of George Washington University experts to review the government’s death certification process. He promised that “regardless of what the death certificate says,” each death would be inspected closely to ensure a correct tally.\n“This is about more than numbers, these are lives: real people, leaving behind loved ones and families,” Rossells said at a news conference in late February.\nLynn Goldman, dean of GW’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, expects an initial report to be released in coming weeks. The school’s findings will include the first government-sponsored attempt by researchers and epidemiologists to quantify Hurricane Maria’s deadliness. Experts are assessing statistical mortality data and plan to dive into medical records and to interview family members of those who have passed, though the scope and funding of the deeper investigation is still unclear, as its timing.\nSome cases are obviously storm-related, Goldman said, such as someone dying after a tree branch falls on his head while clearing debris or someone who suffers a heart attack during the storm and was unable to get help. But death certificates bearing the phrase “natural causes” will require further investigation.\nThe Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico has gone to court in an effort to seek the island’s Department of Health and Demographic Registry’s mortality data for the months since November, the last month information was available. The Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics also announced in recent weeks it would perform an independent death count and use subpoena powers to retrieve the data. Spokesman Eric Perlloni Alayon said in a statement the government is still trying to verify the death toll and does not plan to release any new data.\nThe Harvard researchers reported that there are several reasons the death toll in Puerto Rico has been drastically underestimated. Every disaster-related death, they said, must be confirmed by the government’s Forensic Sciences Institute, which requires that bodies by brought to San Juan or that a medical examiner travel to the local municipality. And it can be difficult to track indirect deaths from a worsening of chronic conditions due to the storm.\nMany families here are awaiting clarity on what happened to their loved ones when “natural causes” became the only explanation. That is what was written on Leon’s death certificate the morning a local law enforcement official brought the document to the family home. The Puerto Rico Department of Justice’s Yamil Juarbe said in a statement it is customary for local officials in these cases to review bodies for any signs of trauma and talk to relatives to learn about the deceased’s medical history. That information is collected and sent to the central office of the Institute of Forensic Sciences.\nLeon’s family said her name was misspelled on the death certificate and her death was incorrectly attributed to diabetes; they say she did not have any known chronic diseases. Officials later corrected the documents, but it was one of several indignities and oversights the family tracked.\nLeon’s demise began with a virus, and the first signs appeared as she was delivering donations to families of Boy Scouts who had lost their homes in another city, Humacao. During Thanksgiving week, Leon had planned a feast for her family but felt too sick to finish the turkey. She seasoned the bird and a local bakery roasted it. Then the vomiting and diarrhea struck her.\nIt took 20 minutes to obtain cell reception and call 911 from their metropolitan Caguas neighborhood. It took another 10 minutes, records show, before the ambulance could reach Leon’s home because of road congestion and failing traffic lights. Paramedics tried to revive Leon using CPR, but she was already dead upon their arrival. Montanez tried for days to have an autopsy performed, but she said no government agency or private medical organization had the capacity to conduct one.\nMontanez stays awake many nights replaying her mother’s last days. She tries to remember the woman who joked so often, and so wryly, that her children often weren’t sure when she was being serious. She recalls how Leon gave each of her neighbors a whistle to call for help in an emergency during Puerto Rico’s prolonged blackout, and how she organized trick-or-treating by lantern light for the children in the barrio so they wouldn’t miss out on Halloween after the hurricane.\nPublished: May 29, 2018, 10:20 a.m."

He has certainly practiced the stay-the-course storyline.\nHow many times have we suffered White House fanfare for a presidential speech that will finally solve the mystery of our foreign policy? How many times have we listened, only to reluctantly conclude that George W. Bush is indeed a broken record, and worse for wear?\nGeorge waved the bloody shirt at Fort Bragg, recalling 9-11 and global terrorists. He again brought forth the well-used and amazingly stupid idea that we will somehow take the war to the terrorists. And yes, he was talking about Iraq.\nThose of us living in the reality-based world must be ever so tiresome to our nifty commander in chief.\nIn the real world, Mr. Bush, young Americans die, are maimed and morally devastated by wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, both conducted without legal or moral justification, and hence without hope. In the real world, Americans, Iraqis and Afghans all suffer a conflict dreamed up by finely fed and well-dressed neoconservatives in air-conditioned Washington suites.\nAt leisurely lunches and late night planning sessions they designed a boutique war to be fought by tin soldiers. I imagine the work, and the finger food, was positively delicious.\nAs he has since his 9-11 raison d’tre, Bush emphasized this week that we shall prevail by taking the war to the \"terrorists.\" This must sound great echoing off the peach and lavender rooms of the administration’s unreality-based world.\nOn the other hand, many great thinkers on military affairs have extensively studied the reality-based world, and thus might be helpful. Sun Tzu, for example. The ancient strategist wrote, \"The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\"\nTransfixed by the light of their own brilliance reflecting from pastel-sheened walls and bulletproof windows, the Bush administration hears him not.\nKarl von Clausewitz wrote, \"No one starts a war — or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so — without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.\"\nHear, hear! But it seems that the neoconservatives who long envisioned the toppling of the Ba’ath Party, and the emplacement of an administration-friendly Prime Minister in Baghdad as a Do-it-Yourself weekend project, were deafened once again by their own self-congratulatory cheers.\nClausewitz, always trying to help innocent politicians, wryly noted, \"In war the will is directed at an animate object that reacts.\"\nSir Basil Liddell-Hart, in the mid-1900s, not so long ago, expanded upon Clausewitz in this regard. The old Brit noted, \"Natural hazards, however formidable, are inherently less dangerous and less uncertain than fighting hazards. All conditions are more calculable, all obstacles more surmountable than those of human resistance.\"\nAs President, George W. Bush is a public example of a life spent failing to learn from either his betters or his mistakes, refusing to develop empathy when revenge felt better, and avoiding the hard work and self-doubt of personal accountability. He vows to stay the course and exercise his will because without that, he is left alone with his fears of inconsequentiality and too many vengeful ghosts. It’s enough to drive a man to drink, to swear, to cry and crumble.\nThe audience at Bragg was politically controlled and generally pro-Bush, yet the only applause-based interruption of Bush’s speech was apparently the result of a Bush aide’s signaling.\nAmerican service members and their families — now in the third year of a three-week war driven by a secret Washington establishment geostrategy and fueled by blatant repetitive lies — have seen their friends and lovers and children in wheelchairs and in coffins. They have intimately witnessed the disturbing moral fractures and personality changes that are inevitable in war — whether Congress declares one or not. Unlike George W. Bush, they are challenged by this. Unlike their confident and willful President, they pray every day for their faith to be sustained, and to be delivered from evil.\nThat they might need to be prompted to cheer this particular President is no surprise.\nSir Basil also noted that \"No man can exactly calculate the capacity of human genius and stupidity, nor the incapacity of will.\"\nThe history of George W. Bush and his long-desired and endless war in Iraq may disprove Liddell-Hart on this count."

        "text": "Stopping nearsightedness in kids and more.\nThis week, Dr. Sydney Spiesel discusses a way to stop the progression of nearsightedness in kids, a better method of hormone replacement therapy for women after menopause, and new developments in the search for a cause for autism. His column will start appearing a couple of times a month.\nCondition: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the most common eye problem. In the United States and Europe, about 25 percent of the adult population is nearsighted, and in much of Asia the condition is more common still. Significant myopia can have serious medical consequences. It has long been understood that the condition has a strong genetic component: Nearsighted parents are more likely to have nearsighted children. But recent research has shown that other factors contribute. For example, just as our mothers warned us, there is now evidence that doing close-up work, like reading, seems to promote the condition.\nHow it progresses: The eyeball of a nearsighted person is deeper than the eyeball of a person with normal vision and becomes deeper as nearsightedness progresses. Myopia often begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 8. As children grow, their nearsightedness worsens, continuing to do so long after they have stopped growing taller. Though we know a lot about factors associated with nearsightedness and its progression, we have no good ideas yet about the mechanism. But can we stop it?\nNew research: A recent study by Wei-Han Chua and colleagues at the Singapore National Eye Center elegantly built on older research and successfully used atropine eye drops to treat myopia in children. Atropine is a longer-lasting version of the pupil-dilating drops your doctor uses when you go for an eye exam. Available by prescription in the United States, the drops are mainly used to treat amblyopia (lazy eye) instead of the older treatment, patching, which children often hate.\nDr. Chua and his co-workers studied the progression of nearsightedness in 400 children between 6 and 12 years of age. Half the children were treated with atropine eye drops, and the other half were treated with placebo eye drops. Both kinds of drops were administered nightly to one eye, so the untreated eye could be compared with the treated one. The children were followed for two years. All used eyeglasses to correct their nearsightedness, and because atropine dilates the pupil, the lenses of the glasses self-darkened in bright light, to avoid discomfort for the children whose pupils were dilated.\nFindings: The effects were extraordinary: After two years, on average, the children’s nearsightedness had not progressed in the atropine-treated eyes but had dramatically worsened in the placebo-treated and untreated eyes. Similarly, atropine-treated eyes did not become deeper, while placebo-treated and untreated eyes did. No serious adverse effects were observed in the course of the research.\nConclusion: This is extremely promising. Further work needs to be done to determine the ideal concentration of atropine in the eye drops, to find out how long the treatment needs to last, and if the effects are permanent. Because atropine interferes with close focusing, children will probably need to wear bifocals while they’re using the atropine drops. Much more research must be done to help us understand why nearsightedness develops and progresses. But in the meantime, we may have a way to head off this common problem.\nTreatment: Hormone replacement therapy was introduced in 1941, when the FDA approved the use of estrogen for this purpose. Early on, HRT was prescribed with great enthusiasm. It relieved troublesome symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes, sleep problems, and, for some women, difficulty in concentration. And HRT (usually estrogen plus a progestin) was shown to improve the bone density of elderly women and decrease their risk for fractures.\nDownside: Time and further research has shown that these gains come at a cost, however: increased risk for cardiovascular problems, stroke, and blood clots in the veins and lungs. Postmenopausal women on HRT also seem to be an increased risk for breast cancer and possibly dementia. This made many women feel they had to choose between improved quality of life and a risk of ill health and early death.\nNew study: Now research reported in the journal Circulation suggests a way around the blood clotting problem, at least. The researchers studied about 270 women who had developed blood clots in their veins, almost all of them postmenopausal. They were compared with more than 600 women who did not suffer from blood clots but similar in age, smoking status, and age at menopause. Among women in either group who used HRT, the study tracked whether the estrogen medication was taken orally or applied through the skin as a patch or a gel. The nature of the progestin component, if any, was also studied.\nFindings: Estrogen HRT increased the risk for blood clots in the veins—but only if it was administered orally. This result is not as surprising as it might seem. A medication that’s given orally collects in the blood supply of the intestines and passes through the liver before it is distributed to the rest of the body. This causes changes in the proteins synthesized by the liver, some of which are known to increase the clotting of blood. When the estrogen in HRT is administered through the skin, by contrast, it bypasses the liver. The study also established that some progestins (there are many kinds) increase the risk of blood clotting and that others do not.\nConclusion: If these findings are confirmed, HRT skin patches or gels and careful choice of the progestin component could normalize the risk of blood clots in the veins, and also blood clots that migrate to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism, and to the brain, causing stroke. Unfortunately, other studies suggest that administering HRT through the skin won’t affect the rate of heart disease or risk of breast cancer associated with it. HRT will still be a difficult choice. But this study at least lowers the risk and may well shift the balance for many women.\nSearch for a cause: It has long been clear that autism is primarily genetic in origin. The disorder is almost certainly the result not of a single abnormal gene, but rather the interaction of several. In the past, a few locations on human chromosomes have been suspected of playing a role for a scattering of patients. Now researchers have identified a genetic location on a specific chromosome that seems to be associated with the expression of autism in many patients.\nNewresearch: Described in a paper with 137 authors representing 67 worldwide institutions, this finding is the first result of an audacious project conducted by the Autism Genome Project Consortium. The project started with a set of almost 1,500 families with at least two people who fall on the autism spectrum. Of this group, DNA samples from about 1,200 families could be analyzed for chromosomal similarities.\nFindings: This analysis points to a hitherto unsuspected “hot spot” on chromosome 11, which seems to be related to an increased risk for the expression of autism. (The genetic function of the hot-spot location is still unclear.) Besides identifying the chromosome 11 hot spot, the data also tantalizingly hint that flaws in the gene coding for a material called neurexin, which plays a role in the development of certain cell-to-cell transmission sites (synapses), can cause autism in some cases. This trigger for autism is probably quite rare. But it suggests that the disorder is somehow related to abnormalities in the connections between nerve cells that make use of glutamate for information transmission, and defects in those transmissions. How (or even if) these two observations—the hot spot and the neruexin flaws—fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn’t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention. And the neurexin-related discovery hints at the mechanism of what might go wrong in neurodevelopment to lead to autism. These discoveries reinforce the value of collaborative work that puts together information about patients with a relatively rare disorder, from many locales, to create a pool large enough for serious research."

Yes, that's a coup,\" he said.\nSpeed II will star Sandra Bullock, making a return appearance in the sequel, and Jason Patric, who is taking over the role played by Keanu Reeves in the original, according to Variety, the movie industry's trade publication.\nSpeed II will help get the studio's name out among film producers, said Chuck Eldred, executive director of the county's Film and Television Commission.\nEldred pushed for the county to give Shuttleworth $208,000 in job growth incentives.\n\"This is exactly what we needed to attract this kind of attention here,\" Eldred said.\nAnd the studio is benefiting from the increased attention being paid to South Florida by Hollywood producers after recent films such as The Birdcage and Striptease, Shuttleworth said.\nThe film's producers will hire extra cast members in Florida, and other technical support workers may be hired locally as well.\nFilm industry publications estimate the cost of making Speed II at $40 million to $70 million.\nThe movie's producers toured the studio in April and have been working there since Monday. Sets are under construction in preparation for filming later this year."

        "text": "In this Sept. 1, 2014 photo released by the U.S. Geological Survey, fluid lava streams from the June 27 lava flow from the Kilauea volcano in Pahoa, Hawaii. The June 27 lava flow is named for the date it began erupting from a new vent. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a warning Thursday, Sept. 4, 2014 to a rural community in the path of a lava flow on Hawaii's Big Island, as the molten rock moved to within a mile of homes. Observatory scientists said lava from the Kilauea volcano could reach the Kaohe Homesteads in five to seven days if it continues advancing through cracks in the earth.\nPAHOA, Hawaii — Lava from one of the world's most active volcanos has been advancing at a slower pace the past few days and is now moving parallel to a sparsely populated subdivision on Hawaii's Big Island.\nLava from Kilauea volcano was still at least a mile from any homes in Kaohe Homesteads, Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said.\nOliveira took a helicopter flight over the area Monday and saw the lava had crept about 150 yards from the previous day. It's moving north for now but could still stop or change directions.\n\"It's been doing that for the last several days,\" he said of its northern pull. Prior to Friday, it was going northeast toward the subdivision.\nThe Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has warned the lava could reach the subdivision in a matter of days.\nOliveira said he didn't anticipate issuing an evacuation order Monday. But residents should be prepared because it's difficult to predict the lava's movement. It was also raining over the flow site, he noted, which meant there wasn't a wildfire threat.\n\"That's good for today,\" he said. \"But it doesn't get us out of any potential threat down the road. It just means it's going to be a very slow process.\"\nThe lava warning has created an \"edgy\" mood in Puna, the rural region on the southeast side of the Big Island that is at risk from the lava, said Bill Parecki, a real estate agent who has lived in the area for 42 years. The area is still recovering from the damage from a tropical storm about a month ago.\n\"Everybody's a little concerned,\" he said. \"Everybody's a little worried. We just have to see where the lava goes. There's no control. It's Mother Nature.\"\nA big concern is lava crossing roads and blocking Puna off from the rest of the island, or becoming \"lava-locked,\" he said.\nBusiness has been quiet since Tropical Storm Iselle made landfall over the region last month, said Mary Bicknell, owner of Big Island Book Buyers, a bookstore in downtown Pahoa.\n\"We're always watching it, but we're not usually threatened by it,\" she said of the lava."

        "text": "After your business is up and running, your focus naturally shifts to increasing efficiency. The small things you do to lower costs and increase output can be the difference between a failing business and soaring profits. No matter how good your team members are, you should tweak the environment in which they work to insure the best possible results.\nThere are many reasons why developing a protocol to measure efficiency benefits your business. You are able to pinpoint areas that need improvement, and you can break your team’s performance down by tasks. Perhaps you will notice that the whole process is going smoothly except for one minor operation that can be eliminated to improve efficiency. This kind of insight can help you restructure the physical environment or delegate tasks in a new way to increase efficiency. You can also evaluate the performance of individual employees. Take a look at how much you get out of employees versus how much you pay them.\nEmployees might be a bit nervous about your new methods of close observation and evaluation. This is acceptable and sometimes even beneficial, as employees will make an increased effort if they know their performance is being tracked. However, you don't have to be an intimidating taskmaster. This is a good opportunity to mix in positive reinforcement and show your appreciation for your team. You can offer incentives, such as public recognition, time off or a share in productivity gains. Whatever mode you choose, employees are sure to improve efficiency if they feel that good work is rewarded and they develop a sense of the needs of the business as a whole.\nEmployees need to have the appropriate equipment and technology to carry out their functions efficiently. A lazy and incompetent worker on a tractor will most likely outperform even the hardest-working person who is plowing manually. Regular maintenance and upgrades of your equipment might seem costly and burdensome, but they are critical to the success of your business. Making sure that your employees have the tools they need to get the job done will drastically improve your output per dollar spent or per unit of time. Keeping equipment up to par also prevents on the job injuries, possible lawsuits and time lost to malfunctions.\nSkill is another side of employee efficiency. Your team must have the requisite skill sets to produce up to par, making on-the-job training and education generally worthwhile. Even though specialization and division of labor are important, your team's efficiency can benefit greatly through cross-training, which gives workers a broader perspective and an understanding of the context in which their work fits. It allows them to help each other and to prioritize more effectively, resulting in overall efficiency. This increased workforce agility allows workers to shift their capacity to where it is needed and reduces problems due to worker absences."

        "text": "The University of Maryland President Wallace Loh.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace Loh stood before reporters Aug. 14 and apologized to the family of Jordan McNair, a football player who died days after a team workout. That day, Loh also announced a commission charged with examining the culture inside the school's embattled football program, an undertaking that could prompt sweeping changes at the state's flagship university.\nIn June, the school had contracted with an outside consulting firm to investigate the events surrounding McNair's death. But the commission Loh announced nearly two months later would be charged with a broader inquiry into the culture of the school's football program - a \"thorough investigation by an independent group,\" Loh said - following media reports that suggested some coaches were abusive toward players, relying on fear, intimidation and bullying.\nFew details about the group's work to date are publicly available, but the commission's directives and composition reveal some of the inherent obstacles that arise when independent bodies investigate problems in university athletic departments.\nIn an initial email to the newly-appointed commission members, a copy of which was viewed by The Washington Post, Loh advised that some of the allegations they would be investigating \"probably occur in every football program\" and that the line between aggressive and abusive training techniques is \"imprecise.\"\nAlso, several of the commission members have previous ties with the university and the stakeholders in the affair. One served as a personal advisor to Loh. Another is the brother of an influential booster.\nAlmost immediately after the commission's unveiling, the University System of Maryland's board of regents took control from the College Park campus, adding five additional members to the three named by Loh and suggesting that key decisions about the football program's future would be made by the regents, not necessarily the school president. The vice chair of the board of regents is a prominent donor to the athletics department and has voiced public support for head football coach DJ Durkin.\nThis investigation could go a long way to determining the fate of Durkin, who was placed on administrative leave along with three other member of the athletic staff in the immediate aftermath of the media reports. One of those, football strength and conditioning coach Rick Court, has negotiated a settlement and resigned.\nAccording to multiple people familiar with the process, Durkin was interviewed by investigators on the morning of Aug. 22, and they were particularly keen on questioning Durkin about his alleged use of food to demean players, possible verbal abuse and his handling of injuries.\nThe commission's review is expected to also look at the actions of other prominent coaches and staff members, including Damon Evans, who was promoted to athletics director less than two weeks after McNair's death. Loh, too, could find himself scrutinized by one or both of the external probes. He nixed a plan recommended by the school's athletic director to fundamentally change the way athletes receive medical treatment and athletic training less than a year before McNair died.\nThere is no formal deadline for the commission to complete its review of the football program.\n\"We're trying to get that all done this month, one way or another, so that all the facts we can gather are in front of the board and the campus and then decisions can be made about the future,\" Robert Caret, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said in an interview last week, \"both to protect student-athletes themselves but also to create the kind of environment we want.\"\nA day after he addressed reporters, Loh sent an email to his three new commission members, as well as a handful of school officials, laying out the assignment. He told them \"to interview a sufficiently large sample of current and former players, their parents, athletics staff, and any other relevant stakeholders, in order to make an assessment on whether the relatively few (but deeply troubling) cases of alleged'abuse,' reported anonymously in the media, indicate the existence of a widespread'toxic culture'.... or, do these reported cases represent only a small portion of the population of football players, present and past.\"\nLoh told the members that \"arguably, a hyper-masculine and insular culture is the norm, rather than the exception, in college football.\" Furthermore, he advised them that \"some of the alleged verbally abusive or demeaning behaviors probably occur in every football program. It is part of the'football culture.' There is, of course, an imprecise line between training practices that aggressively push players to the limit and are acceptable, and practices that most reasonable persons would deem to be physical and/or emotional abusive conduct.'\"\nAsked about Loh's email, Maryland spokesperson Katie Lawson said: \"The president acknowledges that athletic programs are by their nature demanding and intense, and he asked commission members to investigate if Maryland's program crosses a line into destructive or abusive, which is absolutely unacceptable. President Loh has been clear that if such behavior did exist here, it will not be tolerated.\"\nAfter assuming ownership of the investigation two days later, the board of regents added five more members to the commission, including former Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich and Tom McMillen, the former Terps' basketball star who served three terms in Congress.\nIn expanding the panel, the regents faced the delicate task of appointing people who are sufficiently knowledgeable about football and the school but not too partisan.\n\"Ideally, you want somebody who has more than a passing familiarity with that space and the cultures that exist in that space,\" said a veteran college sports administrator, who requested anonymity so he could speak candidly about the process. \"At the same time, that can cause people to be apologists for all that behavior. That's one of the inherent challenges. I know some of the people on the Maryland committee. They're good people, but many are affiliated with the University of Maryland.\nRichard Legon, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said the composition of the Maryland commission on its face appears sound.\n\"I think if you have a former a member of Congress, a former governor, other prestigious leaders who are connected or not to the institution, what you can get to is an outcome with a high degree of credibility,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, credibility allows the board to put greater stock into the recommendations and take whatever actions they're going to take.\"\nThe web of relationships surrounding the Maryland probe is thorny and highlights several areas of possible concern. The eight commission members, who will be compensated for their work, either declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.\nLoh made Alex Williams, a well-respected retired U.S. District judge, one of his three initial appointees to the commission. Williams is the founder, chief executive and namesake of a center focused on justice and ethics housed within the university's school of behavioral and social sciences.\nPrior to joining the commission, Williams had served as a pro bono personal advisor to Loh following the death of Richard Collins III, a 23-year-old student at nearby Bowie State University, who was killed on Maryland's College Park campus in May 2017.\nDon Scheeler, past president of the Terrapin Club, left his name off a letter in support of Durkin that was sent last month to the regents from the Champions Club, a group of high-level sports boosters. His brother, Charles Scheeler, was another of the three commission members appointed by Loh.\nCharles Scheeler is a Baltimore-based attorney at the law firm DLA Piper, who previously served as the \"independent monitor\" charged with tracking Penn State's implementation of recommendations made in the report that followed the Jerry Sandusky scandal.\nHe also was a top deputy for Sen. George Mitchell a decade ago in the exhaustive investigation into performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Scheeler and his associates at DLA Piper have done much of the commission's investigative legwork behind the scenes.\nAsked about the inclusion of Williams and Scheeler, a spokesman said in a statement to The Post: \"Both have the objectivity and talent to contribute greatly to an impartial investigation of the culture of the University of Maryland, College Park football program.\n\"But they are only two of the eight member independent commission, which is comprised of individuals with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, from both in Maryland and outside the state,\" the statement continued. \"The commission's membership is sufficiently large, fair-minded and diverse in perspective to effectively follow the facts wherever they may lead.\"\nIn addition to Ehrlich and McMillen, the other commission members are retired U.S. District Court Judge Ben Legg; Doug Williams, the former Redskins quarterback who serves as the senior vice president of player personnel for the team; Bonnie Bernstein, an alumnus of the school and veteran sports broadcaster; and Frederick Azar, the chief of staff at Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics in Memphis.\nIt's not known how hands-on all eight of the commission members have been. Two of the eight commission members live outside the area, and others have demanding, full-time jobs.\n\"I think the vast majority of them will have had some hands-on experience,\" Caret said in an interview last week. \"I don't know if they've met face to face or not. I know they've all talked.\"\nA spokesman for the regents said that once the commission has completed its examination, it will share its findings with the board of regents, which will then \"make whatever decisions are necessary to better safeguard and support all students and student-athletes.\" The board of regents is made up of 17 unpaid members who oversee Maryland's system of 12 colleges. With the exception of one student representative, each member is appointed by the governor and can serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\nBarry Gossett is a vice chair of the board of regents and also one of the most influential athletic boosters the school has ever known. He donated $10 million in 2007 to build the football program's \"team house,\" which bears his name, and this spring pledged more than $21 million - one of the largest donations the school has ever received - to a center focused on athletes' academic studies.\n\"From a donor standpoint, I kind of stand behind DJ and his program and what he has been doing,\" Gossett told The Post in an interview before the university placed the coach on leave.\nGossett did not respond to requests to comment last week. He had been tending recently to his wife, Mary, who died Monday. The couple have been donors to the school since 1971, championing causes both in and outside of athletics.\n\"Barry Gossett is a highly regarded member of the Maryland community who has served, and continues to serve, the state in countless ways,\" a spokesman for the board of regents said in an email last week. \"At the same time, he is only one of 17 members of the Board of Regents, which will receive the findings of the independent commission.\"\nLike Don Scheeler, Gossett left his name off the Champions Club letter supporting Durkin.\nThe board doesn't typically play a role in personnel decisions at the system's schools, though it does have oversight over Loh, who has led the state's flagship university since 2010.\n\"The board obviously can have influence on the president,\" Caret said.\nStephen Ross, a Penn State sports law professor who directs a cross-campus center on sports issues, said the pre-existing relationships on these investigative bodies aren't usually as important as the underlying motivation behind the appointment.\nHe says there are scenarios where those pre-existing ties could undermine an investigation but others in which they could lend credibility, diversify the commission and appease stakeholders in the event of a critical report.\n\"To me, an ad hoc committee designed to deal with a major public relations problem is itself an exercise in strategic communication,\" he said.\nThere is no rulebook for such investigations and schools can pursue them on their own terms. Similar external examinations have been conducted at schools such as Ohio State, Michigan State and Penn State, facing widespread criticism from some corners unhappy with different facets of the respective probes or findings.\nThe Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges issued a formal statement to schools in 2009 saying \"it is time for all [governing] boards to re-examine how they exercise their oversight responsibilities.\" The organization urged governing bodies, such as Maryland's board of regents, to refrain \"from fostering personal relationships with the athletics director or coaches,\" and urging them to \"exercise appropriate oversight while avoiding micromanagement, viewing athletics with a dispassionate perspective.\"\n\"We don't want them running college sports,\"Legon said, \"but we want them to recognize the buck stops with them.\""

This week, that means works by Latin-American masters. The painter Rufino Tamayo, who ably combined elements of Cubism and Surrealism with Mexican themes and a keen sense of color, is represented by six works in Sothe- by's Latin-American sales (Nov. 18-19). The most important is a monumental canvas from 1955, \"America,\" which for the past fifteen years has been on view at the Dallas Museum of Art. The Tamayos will share the podium with works by the Uruguayan- born modernist Joaquín Torres-García and his fol- lowers (known as the School of the South) and by several female Surrealist painters, including Reme- dios Varo and Leonora Carrington. (York Ave. at 72nd St. 212-606-7000.)

Jared Polis was undecided on whether to veto a bill to expand police transparency in Colorado.\nBut Polis spokeswoman Maria De Cambra set the record straight late Wednesday.\nThe signing is slated for 10:50 a.m. Friday at the Capitol, and it will be open to media, De Cambra said.\nPolis is allowed to wait 10 days to sign bills, which gives him until Saturday in this case. In an earlier call Wednesday, De Cambra had said that the governor was still undecided.\nThe bill — HB-1119, sponsored by Democratic Denver Rep. James Coleman — would require Colorado law enforcement agencies to open the files on completed internal investigations into a wide range of police interactions with citizens, including alleged incidents of excessive force.\nThis would mean the public, media, lawyers and any other interested parties would, through open records requests, get a glimpse at how Colorado cops police themselves. As it stands, the Denver Police Department is the only Colorado law enforcement agency that consistently releases comprehensive information following internal investigations.\nThe bill passed the House and Senate and has been sitting on the governor’s desk for about a week, awaiting the final signature needed to make HB-1119 state law.\nUpon learning Polis was not necessarily on board with the bill, the Colorado Press Association — one of the primary backers of the bill — sent out an email to its members that called the situation “urgent” and implored journalists and editorial boards to speak out now in support of HB-1119.\nMedia in the state have heralded the bill as a key step toward transparency from an institution that shrouds much of its accountability system in secrecy. The Denver Post’s Noelle Phillips testified in support of HB-1119 this year.\nThe effort’s other supporters include the ACLU and Colorado Common Cause, the libertarian Independence Institute and media groups such as the Colorado Broadcasters Association and the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. Colorado Independent Editor Susan Greene testified last year in support of a version of the bill."

        "text": "Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries, as Christian rulers.\nThis is the stuff of late antiquity as it would be recognised in any classics or history university department. It is, as Tom Holland points out in the opening pages of his latest book, a period of fundamental importance for the shape of our world, as it is the era in which religious monotheism, rather than political kingdom, comes to dominate history.\nIn that context, Holland focuses on the birth of Islam through the prophet Mohammed in Mecca and Medina (modern-day Saudi Arabia) during the course of the seventh century, as it is told to us by one of Mohammed’s biographers, Ibn Hisham, in the ninth century. The faith of Islam, as Holland points out, is centred on the study and strict observation of both the divine revelations to Mohammed (the Koran), and how Mohammed acted during his lifetime (the Hadith and the Sunna).\nYet, echoing what many (mostly non-Muslim) scholars have queried before, Holland points to the historical problem of the evidence: before 800AD, almost 200 years after Mohammed’s death in 632AD, the only “traces we possess” for the development of Islam “are either the barest shreds of shreds, or else the delusory shimmering of mirages”.\nHolland examines late antiquity not as an age of decline and fall, but of energy and inventiveness, setting the Arab world and Mohammed’s life in the context of the changing geographies, cultures and priorities of the empires of Rome around the Mediterranean, the Sassanians to the East, and the religious and cultural melting-pot of the “Holy Land”, which connected them. Holland identifies key events, places, ideas and decisions within the Persian and Roman systems which may have impacted upon the Arab world, and, in turn, on the birthplace of Islam in Mecca and Medina.\nIn so doing, Holland argues for the forging of Islam in the political and military instability and opportunity of a world convulsed by a changing balance of power. The process, he continues, ensured that, by the ninth century, “a version of Islam’s beginnings that gave no scope for anyone to rule as a Deputy of God”, and in turn no room “for acknowledging the momentous role in the forging of Islam by countless others”, had gained acceptance, the continued presence of which, inevitably, makes Holland’s thesis difficult reading for an Islamic audience.\nFocusing on the wider context to unpick key moments in history is a classic Holland approach, echoing, for example, his study of the fifth century BC Persian invasion of Greece in Persian Fire (2005), which explored the context and prior history of the Persian and Greek worlds. Such an approach is now in vogue, because it demands that the historian break the often stifling disciplinary boundaries that have traditionally governed the study of worlds which knew no such boundaries.\nThis is a handsome volume, tackling an important question from a novel perspective, backed by useful notes and written in an accessible and fluid style. But, as I am sure Holland would accept, in part because of the charged nature of the material and issues on which it dwells, and in part because of the vast developments and arenas it attempts to encompass, it is also bound to encounter the full spectrum of critical reaction."

        "text": "Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note?\nIn 2014, it was hard to find bad-performing stocks, as the market put in a sixth straight year of gains. For Container Store Group, though, its first full year as a public company was a disaster for investors, with the stock plunging almost 60% last year. Amid falling same-store sales and worrisome trends in overall revenue, confidence in Container Store&apos;s future prospects took a huge hit. Yet as shares have started to stabilize, though, shareholders hope that the worst is over for the company and that customers might return in force to take advantage of the retail chain&apos;s organizational products. Moreover, some enthusiasm both from the professional analyst camp and from an activist hedge fund could help support the stock in the future. Let&apos;s take an early look at what&apos;s been happening with Container Store over the past quarter and what it&apos;s likely to say in its earnings report on Thursday afternoon.\nCan Container Store get its earnings organized better this quarter?Investors are more pessimistic than they were a few months ago about Container Store&apos;s earnings, having slashed their views on November-quarter earnings by 30%. Yet even though the stock has fallen 14% since early October, share prices have bounced off their lowest levels since then.\nJust about all of the damage done to Container Store&apos;s stock came following its fiscal second-quarter report. On its face, 39% growth in adjusted net income seemed like a reasonably promising performance, coming from a 5.2% rise in net revenue. Yet comparable store sales were actually down 0.4% for the quarter, showing just how important Container Store&apos;s continued expansion has been to its overall growth. Overhead costs rose at a faster pace than revenue, and Container Store cut its guidance for full-year revenue by about $20 million and gave lower predictions of earnings per share than shareholders were looking to see. With comps also predicted to fall again this quarter, the stock plunged 25% in a single day following the announcement.\nSince then, Container Store has finally drawn some interest. In late October, a presentation from activist hedge fund Apex Capital highlighted its 4.5% ownership interest in Container Store, with Apex&apos;s founder exploring options such as encouraging faster growth, expense reductions, and even considering selling the company in a going-private transaction. With private-equity company Leonard Green & Partners holding a majority stake in Container Store, Apex will have to convince its institutional peer that its suggested plan of action has merit for the company.\nMoreover, some investors simply believe that Container Store&apos;s stock is cheap enough to be attractive. In November, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded the organizational-goods company, highlighting some of Container Store&apos;s plans to execute a turnaround of its sluggish sales and drive more customers into its stores.\nOne long-term concern that investors need to consider is whether potential cost-cutting moves could endanger Container Store&apos;s renowned corporate culture. The company prides itself on treating its employees well, with generous salaries of roughly double the average in the retail industry. Many argue that treating its employees well leads to better results for Container Store, but without solid earnings growth, reducing compensation costs would be a tempting way for an institutional investor to push more money down to the bottom line quickly.\nIn the Container Store earnings report, be sure to watch whether the company further reduces guidance. Although the fiscal quarter doesn&apos;t include the whole of holiday season, investors should expect to get a good read on whether Container Store had a successful time in a key season for the retail industry. If Container Store can&apos;t deliver an optimistic message this time around, its stock could easily end up headed downward once again.\nThe article Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note? originally appeared on Fool.com.\nDan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

        "text": "AMC Networks Earnings Beat Estimates, CEO Says'Walking Dead' Franchise \"Will Have a Long Life\"\nAMC Networks on Thursday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings amid higher distribution and advertising revenue as management touted the outlook for hit show The Walking Dead, which is currently in its seventh season and which has been a big topic of debate among Wall Street analysts.\nAMC Networks shares were up 13.6 percent in early Thursday trading at $65.30 as investors cheered the upside earnings surprise.\nIn the company's earnings report, he had similarly said: \"The Walking Dead remains the No. 1 show on television by a wide margin and is a powerful example of programming that we own and distribute that commands a loyal audience, attracts advertising revenue, and has significant ancillary revenues that will benefit our business for years to come. With a rapidly expanding studio business, we now have a growing portfolio of shows that we own that provide this kind of opportunity for our business.\"\nAsked about the studio business on the call, Sapan said: \"The company is becoming and has become more of a studio,” rather than “only a channel operator.” He said that has allowed its shows to play on its own channels in the U.S. and internationally, then go to Hulu or Netflix in a later window in the U.S. and be sold to other distributors in foreign markets where the company has no channels.\nAMC Networks so far has not produced shows only for other companies and has no plans to do so, but could consider such a production approach longer-term if the financial returns and strategic benefits make sense, said Sapan.\nAsked about the company's channel portfolio, Sapan said its quality and pricing counts more than the number of channels at a time when some peers may have to close down weaker channels, according to analysts. \"We have been of the mind for some time that quality matters, brands matter, content matters, engagement matters,\" said Sapan. \"And you don’t get a free lunch for showing up with 22 channels.\" He added that his team felt that \"a day of reckoning would come” for some peers.\nWhile the company felt SundanceTV and BBC America, in which it bought a stake, are well-defined channels, overall, he said, \"we have already skinnied our offering down.” And AMC Networks channels should still get higher carriage fees, he reiterated. “Collectively, they are underpriced,\" said Sapan.\nThe cable networks company on Thursday posted a profit of $14 million for the latest quarter, or earnings per share of 20 cents, compared with $90 million in the year-ago period, or $1.23. The company in the latest quarter took non-cash impairment charges of $68 million related to AMC Networks International-DMC, its Amsterdam-based media logistics facility.\nAdjusted for charges, earnings reached $92 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with $102 million, or $1.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in adjusted earnings per share was \"primarily related to the increase in adjusted operating income more than offset by an increase in miscellaneous expense.\" Wall Street analysts had on average expected earnings of $1.27 per share. Estimates had come down a bit after Sapan in December said that advertising was looking softer than anticipated.\nA 9.2 percent increase in quarterly operating income and 9.2 percent adjusted operating income at the company's U.S. networks, which include AMC, IFC and SundanceTV, reflected higher revenue, offset by an increase in operating expenses. \"The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses,\" the company said. \"Programming expenses included charges of $5 million in the current-year period related to the write-off of programming assets, as compared to charges of $16 million in the prior year period.\" The company didn't immediately say which show or shows the write-off was for.\nU.S. advertising revenue rose 3.1 percent despite lower ratings in the quarter for the first half of season seven of The Walking Dead. U.S. distribution revenue jumped 15.6 percent.\n\"2016 was a successful year for our company both financially and operationally, driven by our disciplined and focused strategy of investing in high-quality content and creating brands that have strong, growing, passionate and engaged audiences,\" said Sapan.\nHe continued: \"We are embracing changing viewing habits by making strategic investments in streaming services that fit well with our programming and the audiences at our network brands. As we look ahead in 2017, we see a number of attractive growth opportunities for our businesses and remain committed to delivering meaningful value to our shareholders.\nMichael Morris, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners, said in a note previewing the results: \"Season 7 of The Walking Dead premiered in late October, and though the show started strong, by the mid-season finale ratings were declining in excess of 20 percent on a year-over-year basis, worse than the 15 percent decline built into our estimates.\"\nHe lowered his fourth-quarter U.S. networks advertising growth estimate for the fourth quarter to 0.5 percent from 6.0 percent \"given The Walking Dead's recent ratings trends.\" Said Morris: \"This is consistent with management commentary provided in December. We expect the show to remain in production — and popular with consumers — for the next several years, and as such we anticipate related ancillary revenue (from digital and international partners) to remain intact.\"\nBut, he warned, \"Investor concern around the company's key Walking Dead franchise continues to weigh on shares. We continue to believe that market value under-appreciates the company’s ability to develop and monetize compelling programming. However, we do not see a clear path to investor realization and thus remain cautious in our target valuation multiple.\"\nSapan on Thursday also touted the ratings performance of the company's networks. And he said that AMC will this year air such returning series as Humans, Better Call Saul and Preacher, plus new shows like The Terror and The Son."

        "text": "Jan. 22 will be here before agencies know it. So will Feb. 6. Here’s betting that even April 16 will be here seemingly tomorrow.\nThose are the 45-day, 60-day and 120-day deadlines folded into the Open Government Directive, issued by the White House last month. The first, which arrives soon, is when every federal agency must identify and publish online at least three high-value datasets it plans to make available to the public.\nFifteen days after that, each agency must launch an open-government Web page that is ready to be updated in a timely fashion. By April 16, each agency must unveil an open-government plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities.\nThose are tall orders in short times, to be sure. However, most agencies haven't devised an open-government plan, decided what data is high value or figured out how to share it with the public. The directive is a sweeping mandate designed to transform the way the federal government interacts with the public, yet even its White House authors say each agency is essentially moving through this territory on its own without a road map.\nAgencies have few choices for figuring out how to comply with the directive. They can go it alone and create a plan that they hope makes the grade. Perhaps some will join forces or find industry partners that might guide them to a successful outcome. Or, counting on the kindness of strangers in the White House, they can rely on promised support from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where the authors of the directive live.\nBut even though the vagueness of the directive is a challenge, most agencies agree that it could be worse. Flexibility is better than getting strict and possibly draconian requirements that don’t account for agencies' special needs and different missions. For example, the way NASA shares images of the surface of Mars needs to be different than the way the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shares airline flight delay data.\nThe two men behind the directive are federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. By the Feb. 6 deadline, they are supposed to establish a dashboard on WhiteHouse.gov that will aggregate statistics and visualizations so the public can see how various agencies are doing.\nThe goal of the dashboard is not to highlight agencies’ failures, Chopra said.\nIt’s not unreasonable to assume that new efforts in public engagement will be an evolution of older programs. For example, the General Services Administration published 12 years' worth of Federal Advisory Committee data onto Data.gov the day after the directive was announced.\nDavid McClure, associate administrator of GSA’s Office of Citizen Services and Communications, suggests that agencies take a close look at whom they serve and then provide data that will be the most valuable to people.\nBut with the directive’s deadlines fast approaching, it’s not clear if all, much less many, agencies will be able to demonstrate the early goals of openness and transparency. After all, the memo issued by President Barack Obama that got all this whole thing rolling called for the directive to be published by late May 2009. It ended up being released Dec. 8, which shows that creating a transparent government isn’t a see-through process."

        "text": "Perhaps more than any other age group, 8- to 12-year-olds are investigators of sorts, discovering their strengths and weaknesses and how they fit into the world. Sylvie Weil reinforces this idea in My Guardian Angel (Arthur A. Levine), which tells the story of Elvina, an 11th century Jewish girl who secretly cares for a wounded Christian Crusader despite fears of what his compatriots might be planning for her community. The Shadows of Ghadames (Delacorte), by Joëlle Stolz, is set 800 years later in Libya, yet 12-year-old Malika finds herself in a similar situation. She longs to travel and study like her father and brother do, but as a Muslim female, she isn’t allowed. When an injured man in trouble is taken into her home, however, her world broadens a bit more.\nA retelling of Miguel de Cervantes’ Tales of Don Quixote (Tundra) packs the title character’s deeds into 200-odd pages, just one-fifth of the original work. Barbara Nichol’s treatment, however, captures the spirit of the aging knight-errant determined to right all the wrongs—some imagined, some not—that he comes across. The adventures of the orphaned Stephen Lansbury are, on the whole, less imaginary but just as bizarre. In The Valley of Secrets (Simon & Schuster), by Charmian Hussey, young Stephen unexpectedly inherits a strange estate after an unknown great-uncle dies, and he must use the uncle’s diary about a trip through the Amazon to unravel the supernatural goings-on.\nThe 11-year-old in Joan Givner’s Ellen Fremedon (Groundwood) sometimes wishes she were an orphan because her bratty twin siblings always seem to be getting in the way. Ellen’s biggest worry, though, is that she won’t be able to put enough interesting tidbits into the novel she’s writing—until the twins go missing after looking into an environmental threat to their community. In Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen (Knopf), it’s the cats who are disappearing. Wendelin Van Draanen’s ninth Sammy Keyes mystery has the skateboard-riding girl detective contending with an increasingly vicious school enemy while figuring out why large numbers of neighborhood felines are unaccounted for.\nIt’s no mystery where Indigo Casson has gone: He was taken out of school for a semester to recover from mono. Indigo’s Star (Margaret K. McElderry), Hilary McKay’s sequel about the Casson family, opens with the middle schooler dreading his return to a place where he’d been relentlessly bullied. Yet aided by a new student and his precocious youngest sister, Rose (the Casson kids are all named after paint colors), Indigo learns to stand up for himself. The title character of Becoming Naomi León (Scholastic), by Pam Muñoz Ryan, must do the same after her alcoholic mother shows up (following a seven-year absence) and disrupts Naomi’s happy life with her younger brother and great-grandmother. When Naomi discovers the courage hinted at by her name, she not only reclaims her family but also expands it, establishing a relationship with her father, who had been kept from her."

        "text": "Question: What's one company culture characteristic that you have found makes your startup employees the happiest? How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. The predictability and structure of these meetings make it extremely easy for employees to deliver feedback, both good and bad. This level of transparency and communication keeps employees happy and motivated.\"\n\"At RTC, we have a motto as a publisher: \"Don't expect your reader to change through reading your book if you haven't changed through writing it.\" That motto defines our core belief that continual growth is necessary for the human spirit to regularly experience joy in the workplace. As a result, our executive team strives to help our staff remove aspects of their work that do not bring them joy so that they can focus on what they love doing. By intentionally making room for them to focus on what they enjoy, they are able to grow out aspects of the business that bring them deep personal satisfaction while also serving our clients. We've developed entire new lines of business this way, as well as new positions within the company. Support their dreams, and they will grow your business.\"\nFollow Rule #2: Have Fun!\n\"When my co-founder and I started'ZinePak, our business plan read simply, \"Make money. Have fun.\" As the company has grown, we've made sure not to lose sight of this mission. At the end of each day, we ask our employees if they had fun that day. Almost without fail, the answer is always \"yes.\" We try to always remember that we're an entertainment company. We aren't changing the world. We aren't curing cancer. No one's life is at risk, so there is no need for the doom-and-gloom culture that seems so prevalent in Corporate America. From half-day Fridays to candy jars to days off for charitable activities of the employee's choice, we try to mix \"fun\" into everything possible to ensure that work feels as much like play as possible.\"\n\"We always take time to celebrate our wins. Whether it's a new project, new teammate or new launch, we take time to recognize team and individual successes. Taking small breaks to socialize and catch up at team happy hours reenergizes the team and ultimately leads to awesome workflow and collaboration. Our internal party planning committee makes consistent plans to pull us away from our desks and into fun environments where we can take our minds off work for a bit.\"\n\"I think that people are generally happiest at work when they are engaged by the work that they do. Doing the same jobs, having the same responsibilities and facing the same tasks day in and day out can get tiresome. In my company, there is a variety of work to be done, and employees are encouraged to embrace the variety. This keeps work fresh. We also support telecommuting (to the degree that we don't even have a \"home\" office -- all work is done \"off-site\") and flexible schedules. We trust our team to do their work when they can and where they can. Work variety and flexible work results in employees who are happy and productive. \"\n\"When we started, we had been told to be careful of what we share with our employees and other stakeholders. We, however, are very open and transparent communicators and did not keep anything confidential and didn't hold back any information. This allowed our early employees to not only feel like they were playing an important trusted role in making an impact on growing the company, but also allowed them to dissent and suggest better ways of accomplishing objectives. They respected the founders because they saw not just what decisions we made, but how we made them, right or wrong. And for failed experiments, we had their support and morale to pivot quickly. Each and everyone felt individual ownership for each decision and worked that much harder to succeed, because they never felt separate.\"\n\"Every other Friday, someone different leads our team workout. We've played tennis and basketball, done yoga and CrossFit and even learned (barely) various martial arts. Unintentionally, we've taken risks doing new things, discussed how we're improving our lives (not just our work) and laughed a lot. The benefits of exercise combined with the additional vulnerability, camaraderie and fun has increased the happiness quotient of Team Fig. \"\n\"When people hear the words \"company culture,\" they often think about ping pong tables or beer taps. While those sorts of perks are cool, they really don't matter unless you've created the right work environment to embrace them. You create that environment by giving people a voice. When we built our new corporate office space, it was very important to solicit opinions and ideas from our employees. Before moving into our new facility in 2011, we hosted an internal version of Pinterest where employees could put ideas and pictures that they felt should be considered for the new space and workstation setups. In the end, when you're making a decision based on democratic feedback, you need transparency. People will be invested in the outcome as long as they feel like the process is fair. \"\n\"The characteristic that I swear by is living the mission every day. Oftentimes, people join your team/company as a startup because you are doing something different or you're doing something the way no one has done it before. You cannot afford to lose that, and you have to live that everyday. For us, that is our mission. Everyone who has joined our team is in it for the mission, and we push it and live it every day, which makes our team members happy. \""

        "text": "On Tuesday, August 20, a US army veteran named Mark Paslawsky was killed during a battle in Ilovyask, near Donetsk, which is currently held by anti-Kiev rebels.\nFighting on the side of pro-government forces, the American had sprung to prominence because of his Twitter feed (@BruceSpringnote), often sharply critical of Ukrainian politicians, and a fawning video interview with Vice News’ Simon Ostrovsky shortly before his death.\nThe 55-year-old West Point graduate, who was also a former investment banker, mainly focused on Moscow, Kharkov and Kiev, claimed he had changed his nationality to Ukrainian to enlist in the Donbass Battalion. Paslawsky fought under the pseudonym ‘Franko’ and served in the US army until at least 1991, when he was described as a captain in a New York Times op-ed.\nThere was a very good reason for Paslawsky’s use of a nom-de-guerre like ‘Franko’ and the social media handle ‘Bruce Springnote’ and for the soft soap in the US media.\nPaslawsky was not an “ordinary Joe” from New Jersey with benign family connections to Ukraine who suddenly decided to help defend the motherland, he was the nephew of the notorious Nazi Mykola Lebed – who incredibly was employed by the CIA from 1949 to possibly as late as 1991. There is no insinuation that Paslawksy also harbored fascist or anti-Semitic beliefs, but family influences surely played a significant role in the formation of his world view.\nLebed began his terrorist career in 1934 when he was sentenced to death for the murder of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki – later commuted to life imprisonment – but he escaped in 1939. He would go on to lead the genocidal ethnic cleansing of Poles in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia (the area around Lutsk and Rivne in modern-day Ukraine).\nInstead of facing trial for his vicious war crimes after his fellow fascists in Germany were defeated, Lebed was spirited to America where – based in New York – he gathered information on the Soviet Union for the CIA (a scheme known as Operation Aerodynamic).\nOf course, sheltering Nazis was a common US practice after the war, as bizarre as it seems today, with the primary reason being their potential usefulness in the fight against the Soviet Union. The best known example is Klaus Barbie who they helped to escape to Bolivia, and later Argentina, but according to a 2009 National Archives report “Hitler’s Shadow: Nazi War Criminals, US Intelligence and the Cold War” there were dozens of similar cases. Among them was Rudolf Mildner, who was “responsible for the execution of hundreds, if not thousands, of suspected Polish resisters” and was also involved in the deportation of 8,000 Danish Jews to Auschwitz. The Americans helped Mildner to settle in Argentina. Another was Hans Scholl, a member of Einsatzgruppe B in Belarus, which was blamed for the execution of more than 45,000 people, most of them Jewish.\nThe report goes into great detail about the hideous crimes of Paslawsky’s uncle. One man extensively quoted is Moshe Maltz, a Jew living in Sokal, a town about 85 kilometers north of Lviv: “When the Bandera gangs (a name inspired by the chief Ukrainian Nazi leader, Stepan Bandera) seize a Jew, they consider it a prize catch. The ordinary Ukrainians feel the same way… they all want to participate in the heroic (sic) act of killing a Jew. They literally slash Jews to pieces with their machetes.” Lebed trained at a Gestapo center in Zakopane.\nInterestingly, in 1985 the US Government Accountability Office in Washington mentioned Lebed’s name in a public report on Nazis and collaborators who settled in the States with help from US intelligence agencies. The Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in the Department of Justice began investigating Lebed that year.\nThe CIA shielded Lebed and, as late as 1991, it dissuaded the OSI from approaching the German, Polish, and Soviet governments for war-related records about Ukrainian fascists. Lebed, Bandera’s wartime chief in Ukraine, died in 1998. He is buried in New Jersey.\nLeded married Sophia Hunczak, the sister of Taras Hunczak, a professor emeritus of Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he lectures in Ukrainian, Russian and European History. He also teaches at the Taras Shevchecnko University in Kiev. Despite being a child during World War II, his Ukrainian language Wikipedia entry, judging by the links and tone, an official bio, lists his service as a courier for Bandera’s forces during the war.\nHunczak has written articles for Ukrainian journals whitewashing Roman Shukhevych and his Nachtigall Battalion, including some heavy duty eulogies obviously intended for internal consumption in the Ukrainian language. The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles claims that between June 30 and July 3, 1941, the Nachtgall and their German comrades kidnapped and killed 4,000 Jews in Lviv. In 2007, the pro-NATO Ukrainian government of Viktor Yushchenko issued a postage stamp commemorating Shukhevych.\nSo how we do know Paslawsky is the nephew of Lebed after his extensive efforts to hide his true identity? His Ukrainian-language Wikipedia entry refers to him as being the nephew of Hunczak and also mentions a brother, Nestor.\nIn the September 13, 2009, edition of the US newspaper The Ukrainian Weekly, there is a death notice forSophia Lebed(this page has been removed from the PDF copy on their website as of August 28, but copies are in circulation, one pictured above) lists all her living relatives, including her brother, Taras Hunczak, and her nephews Nestor and Markian (Mark in English) Paslawsky. While it mentions Nestor’s family, it doesn’t for Mark – he told Ostrovsky in the Vice interview that he was a single man.\nA second death notice for Sophia, at the Union Funeral Home in New Jersey, describes her as the “beloved wife of the late Michael (the English form of Mykola) Lebed.” Interestingly, this page was removed on August 27 after Ukrainian violinist Valentina Lisitsa questioned the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty about it on Twitter – it now exists as a cached version only.\nSomebody has been trying to hide the true story of Mark Paslawskyin recent days and western media have shown no interest in telling it.\nThe German language has a word for coming to terms with the past: Vergangenheitsbewältigung. English has many but the US press refuses, once again, to use them."

We don't know what the family was doing in France but it looks like they were on holiday because their car was packed with luggage,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the France3 TV channel, a member of the emergency services said two of the children were dead when they arrived and the father was trapped.\nTwo air amublances were called to ferry the injured mother and surviving son to hospital and police closed off the motorway for several hours.\nThe scene was so devastating that a psychologist was brought in to counsel the two dozen rescue workers who worked at the crash site.\nIn Hartlepool, one neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: \"John was a big lad, he was only young. He's very much like his mum.\n\"It's absolutely awful. I'm just in shock.\"\nAnother neighbour said: \"I knew that they were going away on holiday. It's just such a shock to be honest.\"\nAnother added: \"All I heard was that they have lost a son and a daughter. I know John worked in Italy so he might have been on his way there.\n\"I'm just shocked. I still can't believe that it has happened to somebody we actually know.\"\nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We are providing assistance following a road traffic accident in France, in which three British nationals have sadly died and two others have been hospitalised.\n\"We are working closely with local authorities and supporting the families at this difficult time.\""

        "text": "Technological change has always posed a challenge for companies. But, as we saw once again in 2015, it has never occurred as rapidly, or on as large a scale, as today. As innovation sweeps across virtually every sector, from heavy industry to services, it is transforming the competitive landscape, with the most advanced companies—rather than the largest or most established players—coming out on top.\nFor incumbents, the threat of displacement is very real. The average tenure of a company on the S&P 500 has fallen from 90 years in 1935 to less than 18 years today. Disruptive new players like Uber, which has upended the taxi industry, are tough competitors, often staking out market share by shifting more surplus to consumers. This is part of a broader trend of intensifying competition that, according to recent research from the McKinsey Global Institute, could reduce the global after-tax profit pool from almost 10% of global GDP today to its 1980 level of about 7.9% within a decade.\nThe effect of technology on competition arises largely from the power of digital platforms and network effects. New digital platforms reduce marginal costs (the cost of producing additional units of a good or service) to nearly zero. Adding, say, a Google Maps user carries negligible costs, because the service relies on GPS location data that is already stored on a user’s phone. This allows Google to scale incredibly quickly, and then to leverage this scale (and the convenience of having a single platform) to move into adjacent sectors—such as music (Google Play), payment (Google Wallet), and word processing (Google Docs). In this manner, tech firms can quickly come to challenge incumbents in seemingly unrelated industries.\nOf course, tech firms are not the only ones innovating. A handful of leading firms in practically every industry are deploying digital technology in increasingly sophisticated ways—and seeing huge benefits. The use of sensors to monitor livestock, for example, has far-reaching implications for the food industry.\nBut the most digitally advanced sectors show the greatest progress. Indeed, over the past 20 years, profit margins in these tech-infused sectors have grown two-three times faster, on average, than in the rest of the economy. Even within the most advanced sectors, there is a yawning gap between the top-performing companies and the rest of the pack. For example, the retail offerings of digitally advanced multinational banks far outstrip those of local credit unions.\nAs technology transforms business models and processes, it is also changing the way employees work. Recent McKinsey research finds that already-proven technologies could automate as much as 45% of the tasks individuals are currently paid to perform. In the US alone, that is the equivalent of about $2 trillion in annual wages.\nThe potential benefits of this transformation for companies extend far beyond cost savings, as workers gain time to pursue more valuable tasks involving critical thinking and creativity. Financial advisers can spend less time analysing financials and more time developing solutions that meet clients’ needs. Or interior decorators can shift their attention from taking measurements to devising design concepts, meeting with clients, or sourcing materials.\nTechnology also allows companies to rethink conventional wisdom on organizational design and governance. New information-sharing technologies deliver greater transparency, making organizations more efficient and, in many cases, less hierarchical.\nFor example, the CEOs of Apple, Inditex (a multinational clothing company) and Zappos (a large online retailer) have adopted broad spans of control (the number of subordinates directly reporting to a manager) that far exceed the traditional model of “one to four to eight\". Haier, the Chinese white-goods manufacturer, reorganized its 80,000-person workforce into 2,000 independent units, each responsible for managing its own profits and losses. Since the move, its market capitalization has soared, tripling from 2011 to 2014.\nMoreover, digitization allows companies to operate as “platforms\", not structures, and make greater use of resources outside their company. Insurance company Allstate used the crowdsourcing platform Kaggle to invite programmers to develop a new car accident injury algorithm; the eventual “winner\" was 271% more accurate than its existing model.\nLikewise, China’s DJI became the world’s largest drone manufacturer by focusing on its products’ core technology, while giving away developer kits for free online so that others could build apps. This approach meant that DJI’s drones were equipped with attractive features far earlier than competitors’ products, which relied on in-house app development.\nSimilar technology-driven innovations in thought processes and business models can be seen across the economy, reflected in changes in companies’ planning processes. Some have begun creating separate business plans with two-month and 20-year views, reallocating their resources more aggressively, and using new analytical techniques to identify, attract, develop and retain talent.\nTechnological innovation enables—indeed, requires—companies to boost their agility and thus their competitiveness. That’s why CEOs’ top priorities in 2016 should be to digitize the core components of their business and rethink organizational design and governance processes. Catching this fast-moving—and rapidly growing—“digital wave\" is the only way to avoid getting left behind.\nDominic Barton is the global managing director of McKinsey & Company."

But Jacobsen, a consultant who advises businesses – primarily convenience stores – on where best to locate, said it will overall hurt the businesses in Washoe City. He said that applies especially to convenience stores, the gas station and businesses like the Chocolate Factory and Nevada Lynn Emporium which rely on impulse buyers seeing them and deciding to stop.\nHe said Paul Marazzo, owner of Washoe Flats restaurant – formerly the Cattleman’s – may benefit because his is a destination rather than an impulse stop.\nMarazzo is counting on that. He said when the trucks and other through traffic move to the new freeway, it will also make it much easier and safer for drivers seeking a nice dinner at the restaurant he and his brother, Lynn, operate. And, as the valley develops, he said he’ll get more and more local business.\nAt the same time, he said the freeway will make it easier for people to come to his restaurant because they’ll be able to take the freeway to Parker Ranch Road just south of the restaurant.\nAnd in the meantime, he said the freeway construction crews are excellent customers.\nShe said traffic is the issue and she has been involved in efforts to get people to slow down through the valley.\nTyson Petty, manager of Old Washoe Station, the gas station and mini-mart to the north, made similar comments.\nCouch and Petty both said their businesses may be hurt somewhat but neither thought the loss of traffic would put them out of business."

        "text": "It's been three years since the filing of a suit against the FBI after agents put several Muslims on the No Fly list to retaliate against their refusal to be conscripted as a confidential informants spying on other Muslims; the FBI's illegal retaliation cost their victims their jobs, subjected them to harassment, and cut them off from visits to family overseas.\nThe FBI and Department of Justice don't dispute the fundamentals in this case: that FBI officers placed Muslims on the No Fly list in retaliation for their refusal to cooperate (and not because they were believed to be a security risk), and that this was illegal.\nHowever, they do object to their victims ability to sue individual FBI officials for their illegal actions; the government's lawyers asked the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to find that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) immunizes corrupt officials from legal consequences of lawbreaking, limiting victims to suing agencies, rather than agents.\nThe court disagreed. The FBI's victims' suit against the officers who wronged them can proceed to the next step.\nHaving decided the lawsuit can continue, the Appeals Court decides it doesn't need to reach a finding on the agents' qualified immunity assertions. This will be handled on remand by the lower court, which will first have to make this decision before deciding what (if any) damages the plaintiffs are entitled to.\nThis is far from a victory for the plaintiffs but it does open the door for similar lawsuits against federal officers for harassment and intimidation tactics deployed in hopes of turning lawful residents and visitors into government informants. Raising the possibility of a successful lawsuit above the previously-presumed zero percent should hopefully act as a minor deterrent against future abuses of power."

This is what the Texas Republican Party and the AG argued for.\nNot everyone likes that idea though, and there are many who want only one Primary election date, including both Democrats and a good number of Republican State Senators and Texas Congressmen.\nWe will find out soon from the San Antonio Federal Court whether we will have two Texas Primaries (one in March and One in May) of whether ALL the Primary Elections in Texas will be pushed back to a later day, likely in May.\nI certainly understand some of the reasons for not wanting to have a split Primary, including the extra costs and confusion. I also completely respect the opinions of the State Senators and Congressmen who are for just one later primary date. I do have concerns that this later primary election will devastate the Texas Vote in the Presidential Primary Election.\nA HUGE drawback of pushing back all the primary Elections in Texas would be that it would hurt the ability of Texas to choose the next Republican Presidential Candidate in what would be the biggest election against the Democrats in the History of America.\nRight now, Texas is in position to have a major say in the Republican Presidential Primary election. A later primary Election would give Texas nearly no chance of having a major impact on who the Republican Presidential Candidate will be.\nThe RNC made a rule that if certain states had their primary Elections before March 2012 and February 2012, then those state would lose HALF of their Presidential Primary Delegates. Well, most of the states that have primary elections before Texas have not complied with this rule and therefore those States will lose half of their Republican Presidential Primary Election Delegate Votes. A Candidate needs 1214 Delegates in order to have a majority of the Republican Presidential Primary Delegates and win the Republican Nomination.\nAs it stands, at the end of February 2012, and going into the March Texas Primary Election, there will only have been 87 Republican Presidential Delegates Selected (after the penalties).\nTexas Has 155 Presidential Primary Delegates!\nWith 155 Delegates, A Texas Presidential Primary Election in March could COMPLETELY alter the Republican Presidential Race with Texas getting to pick the leader.\nOn the other hand, a Presidential Primary Election in May would give Texas very little say in the Republican Presidential Race because many more delegates will have been selected and the media will likely have already decided who the leader is by that point in time.\nWe will find out soon from the San Antonio Federal Judges whether we will have two Texas Primaries (one in March and one in May) orwhether ALL the Primary Elections in Texas will be pushed back to a later day, likely May."

        "text": "VIENNA – A senior U.N. official announced progress Friday in long-stalled efforts to resume a probe of suspicions that Iran may have worked to develop nuclear arms, saying the investigation could be restarted by early next year.\nHe acknowledged that a key IAEA request -- a visit to a site linked to suspected nuclear activity --was again denied. But he told reporters at Vienna airport that he expected IAEA experts to be allowed to go to Parchin and follow up on suspicions it might have been used as part of secret arms-related experiments once the probe is resumed.\nIn Tehran, Iran&apos;s state TV made no mention of progress, reporting only that there was no agreement on visiting Parchin. But Iranian envoy Ali Asghar Soltanieh also said a new meeting was set for Jan. 16.\nWhile Nackaerts&apos; comments gave cause for some optimism, they were not the first instance of a senior IAEA official saying that the standoff was close to resolution.\nReturning from Tehran talks more than five months ago, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said the two sides had agreed on \"an almost clean text\", saying a breakthrough deal would be signed soon. Follow-up IAEA-Iran meetings did not yield significant results.\nIran says it does not want atomic arms and has justified a nearly yearlong delay in cooperating with the IAEA&apos;s probe by saying that a framework regulating such an investigation must be agreed on first. But as talks on such an agreement have dragged on, agency officials have complained that they may be nothing more than a delaying tactic.\nThey are particularly concerned that such delays can hurt their efforts to investigate Parchin. The IAEA suspects that Iran has conducted live tests of conventional explosives there that could be used to detonate a nuclear charge and cited satellite photos indicating a cleanup of the site, at a sprawling military base southeast of Tehran.\nIran denies it is sanitizing the site, but Amano has warned that his agency&apos;s chances of a meaningful investigation there are diminishing.\nNackaerts offered no details on the substance of his talks. But diplomats familiar with the negotiations have said previously that the agreement was stalled because the IAEA wanted repeated access to sites, officials or documents of interest. Instead, Tehran demanded that once such access was granted, the person, document or site be off limits to the IAEA for repeated visits, questioning of viewing.\nAmano&apos;s announcement of a nearly done deal in May came just days before the two sides met in Baghdad for a new round of negotiations meant to defuse tensions over Iran&apos;s nuclear program before leaving the negotiating table with little progress made.\nThis time, Nackaerts spoke of movement on the probe as Iran and six world powers again prepare to meet. The six nations hope the talks will result in an agreement by the Islamic Republic to stop enriching uranium to a higher level that could be turned relatively quickly into the fissile core of nuclear arms.\nIran denies such aspirations insisting it is enriching only to make reactor fuel and to make isotopes for medical purposes.\nBy compromising on the IAEA probe, Iran could argue that the onus was now on the six powers to show some flexibility, temper their demands, and roll back U.S. and European sanctions that have hit Iran&apos;s critical oil exports and blacklisted the country from international banking networks.\nThe IAEA has already visited Parchin twice -- the last time in 2005. But it did not have access then to satellite imagery then and visited buildings other than the one now pinpointed by the aerial photos."

FRONT PAGE EDITORIAL -- BIRMINGHAM NEWS, HUNTSVILLE TIMES, PRESS-REGISTER (MOBILE) -- “STAND FOR DECENCY, REJECT ROY MOORE”: “This election is a turning point for women in Alabama. A chance to make their voices heard in a state that has silenced them for too long.\n“During the phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Ryan, who had campaigned heavily for Mr. Johnson in 2016, posed an essential question, according to the senator: ‘What are you going to need?’ What Mr. Johnson needs … is for the bill to treat more favorably small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities -- businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at rates for individuals. Such entities, including Mr. Johnson’s family-run plastics manufacturing business, account for more than half of the nation’s business income, and the senator says the tax bill would give an unfair advantage to larger corporations.\n-- IT’S WORTH NOTING: This is hardly the first time Johnson has clashed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his GOP leadership team. He also fought with them over how the Obamacare repeal process played out. He is just the first Senate Republican out of the gate opposing the bill.

SUSAN COLLINS (R-MAINE) on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION: TAPPER: “You said this week that Republicans made a big mistake when they changed the tax bill to include this repeal of the Affordable Care Act individual mandate because that -- removing that could raise taxes or payment -- health care payments, premiums, for millions of Americans. If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a ‘no’ vote from you?” COLLINS: “Well, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bill said we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that’s … disproportionately 80 percent on those who make under $50,000.\nMORE TAX DRAMA IN THE STATES -- “In Democrat-led state capitals, GOP tax reform push could scramble fiscal plans,” by Laura Nahmias in New York, Katherine Landergan in New Jersey and Carla Marinucci in California: “The Republican tax reform push in Washington is setting off budgetary alarm bells in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey, in the latest political skirmish to pit national Republicans against Democratic state and big city leaders.\n“With Republicans intent on shrinking or repealing the state and local tax deduction, California officials are worried that the House-passed tax bill, and the emerging Senate measure, will force local governments to reduce taxes and make big cuts to schools and social services. In New York, where New York City and state revenues are heavily reliant on just a handful of wealthy tax filers, budget watchdogs fear federal tax changes could trigger the flight of those residents. And in New Jersey, plans for a new millionaire’s tax, one of incoming Gov.

        "text": "Under intense pressure to improve conditions in the jail complex on Rikers Island, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio has developed a plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds to a dedicated jail for youths in the Bronx.\nThe cost to carry out the plan is expected to be about $300 million, officials said.\nThe plan calls for the city to reconfigure the Horizon Juvenile Center, which is currently used to hold 14- and 15-year olds, to house the 16- and 17-year olds who are typically sent to Rikers.\nA 2015 settlement with the Department of Justice on reform at Rikers called on the city to seek an alternative location to house inmates under 18, although it stopped short of requiring it.\nNew York is the only state other than North Carolina that prosecutes all children 16 and older as adults if they are accused of a crime. In New York City, they are likely to wind up at Rikers, a notoriously brutal lockup. There are currently about 200 inmates who are 16 or 17 at Rikers, down from about 330 in 2013.\nThe city and many advocates have urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would treat those under the age of 18 as juveniles, but the proposal has gone nowhere in Albany.\nThe new plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers must overcome several hurdles. It has to be approved through the city’s time-consuming land use process: The local community board and the Bronx borough president get to weigh in and it must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.\nBut the change will not happen any time soon; officials said it could take four years or more to get approvals and to complete construction. The plan also calls for the city to remodel another juvenile detention site, the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold all of the city’s 14- and 15-year-old detainees, including those who had previously gone to Horizon.\nThe cost of refurbishing the Bronx center is budgeted at $170 million. The cost of remodeling the Brooklyn center is budgeted at $129 million.\nAdvocates supported the move but lamented the long delay before the new center will be ready, assuming that it survives the land-use review process.\n“For us this is a marathon, not a sprint.” he said.\nMore than 95 percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds at Rikers are awaiting trial. More than a third have been charged with robbery and about one in 10 have been charged with assault, according to data provided by the city.\nIncreased attention was focused on the plight of younger teenagers at Rikers in 2014 after The New Yorker published an article about Kalief Browder, who was sent there at 16, accused of stealing a backpack. He never stood trial or was found guilty of any crime but he spent three years at Rikers, nearly two of them in solitary confinement. He told of being beaten repeatedly by guards and other inmates and trying several times to kill himself while in custody. After his release he remained deeply troubled by the experience and he committed suicide last year at age 22.\nThe city ended solitary confinement for Rikers inmates under 18 in December 2014."

        "text": "Unprecedented back-to-back annual coral bleaching events have affected two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef, with this year's event already leading to mortality of half the corals in some key tourist tracts, scientists say.\nRecord-breaking warm waters along the Queensland coast has triggered widespread bleaching over 1500 kilometres of the World-Heritage-listed reef over the two summers, said Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.\nProfessor Hughes and his team completed aerial surveys last Wednesday after scoring about 800 separate reefs. The 8000km journey closely followed the path of the 2016 survey that found the northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef most affected.\n\"It's been a huge blow to the reef after last year the northern third was hit and now this year's it's the middle third,\" Professor Hughes said.\nCorals bleach when temperatures exceed tolerance levels for too long, prompting them to expel the algae that supply most of their energy and the brilliant colours. Not all bleached corals die but as much as two-thirds of north corals have succumbed.\n\"The mortality in the central region will continue to unfold over coming months,\" Professor Hughes said. \"We've already seen substantial mortality, up to 50 per cent on some central reefs in the past six weeks.\"\nBleaching has returned even to some of the regions hard hit last year, such as Cape York's Princess Charlotte Bay.\nSome 30 reefs in the north had no score as they \"effectively have ceased to exist at least in the shallow sections as coral reefs\", said James Kerry, a marine biologist from James Cook University who also took part in the survey.\nWhile this year's event is not expected to result in as much coral mortality as in 2016, there are worrying signs corals bleached at lower temperatures than a year earlier. That result may point to more bleaching next summer if conditions are again relatively warm.\n\"It seemed like the bleaching happened more quickly this year, which may suggest they are in a weakened, more stressed state following last year's event,\" Dr Kerry said.\nMark Read, manager of operations support at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said \"2017 has shaped up to be a pretty nasty year when it comes to coral bleaching\".\n\"The corals didn't get any respite at all,\" Dr Read said.\nBleaching, though, was patchy. The authority was already in talks with tour operators to redirect visitors to \"refugia\" where they can still enjoy \"a high-quality experience\", he said.\nSuch areas are likely to be harder to find in the Whitsunday region near Mackay where Cyclone Debbie carved a swathe about 100km wide through the reefs.\n\"The one area that was actually doing pretty good was the one that bore the brunt of the category 4 cyclone,\" Dr Read said. \"A lot of those massive corals are now lying on the beach in those locations. They've simply been snapped and rolled up onto the beach.\"\nTemperatures are showing signs of easing back to more typical levels for this time of year, such as the Davies Reef off Townsville.\nBut the area had been remarkably warm even in a non-El Nino year, such as during the previous 2015-16 summer.\nIn March, for instance, large areas of Queensland reported their hottest mean temperatures on record. These included the coastal region of the state's north adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.\nProfessor Hughes said some corals may regain their colour in the next three to six months, but it would take longer to see if they recovered their reproductive health and began a fuller recovery.\nThe faster growing branch corals and some other rapidly growing \"weedy\" species of corals could rebuild the reefs but the process would take years or even a decade. The loss of boulder corals would take much longer to recover from the bleaching.\nRising temperatures from global warming means the corals are likely to enjoy ever shorter stints between mass bleaching events, the scientists said.\n\"It's highly unlikely we'll have a period of calm for 10 or 20 years that will allow these reefs to re-establish to the point that they might be recognisable as they were,\" Dr Kerry said.\nDr Kerry said he was surprised the severity of the bleaching had not provoked more of a public response: \"I don't really know what else the reef needs to do to signify that it's in serious trouble.\""

        "text": "Editor’s Note: A few weeks ago, we ran a provocative piece by Stephen Watts and Sean Mann in which they argued that in both its politics and in its development, Afghanistan is doing better than is commonly believed. Gary Owen, a civilian development worker who has spent the last several years working on the ground in Afghanistan, begs to differ. He paints a far gloomier picture of Afghanistan, arguing that the country and U.S. policy have a long way to go.\nMany Americans are surprisingly bullish on Afghanistan, and this perspective showed up in a July Lawfare post on “Afghanistan After the Drawdown” by RAND analysts Stephen Watts and Sean Mann. Although the two authors offer some valid points, they miss many of the country’s problems and, in so doing, are wrongly optimistic about where Afghanistan is going.\nAfter a decade and more of U.S. intervention, it can be difficult to pin down how things are going in Afghanistan. By some measures, things in Afghanistan are better: There are more children in school than there were under the Taliban, more Afghans have access to basic healthcare than before the 2001 invasion, and Internet access means more connections to the outside world than was ever possible during the time of the black turbans. Watts and Mann cite those cases as reasons to be optimistic about the country, and rightly so. Where they go wrong is in three key areas: relations with Pakistan, the current government as a symbol of Afghan unity, and the abilities of Afghan security forces.\nPakistan’s got plenty to worry about when it comes to sanctuaries within its own borders, a grim point made by last year’s school shooting in Peshawar. And recent revelations that Mullah Omar died in Pakistan, and his whereabouts were known to the ISI for years, don’t paint a picture of Afghanistan being used as a base to launch operations against Pakistan. Instead it speaks to Pakistan’s harboring of the Taliban with the government’s knowledge, something Islamabad is scrambling to correct as they look ahead to peace talks with the Taliban.\nOr it’s just a case of Afghanistan following the American lead.\nIn the fall of 2014, after another runoff election threatened to bring the country’s democratic future to a grinding halt, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed a group made up of Abdullah’s leadership team. According to an administration official, Kerry told the group, “I have to emphasize to you that if you do not have an agreement, if you do not move to a unity government, the United States will not be able to support Afghanistan.” Aimed squarely at those who supported Abdullah to the point that they might take up arms in his name, Kerry’s statement was an offer neither Ghani nor Abdullah could possibly refuse. The current government isn’t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThe current government isn’t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThanks to advances by the Taliban in Faryab and Kunduz, influential politicians like Rashid Dostum (currently Ghani’s vice president) and Atta Noor (the powerful governor of Balkh province) have been pretty vocal in their thinking that Afghan forces alone can’t get the job done; that to tip the balance means more troops from somewhere—either the Americans (not out of the question completely, but unlikely), or some kind of militia. Since today’s anti-Taliban militia could be tomorrow’s coup attempt, it lays some troubling groundwork for widening existing divides in the country that the United States had hoped the Ghani/Abdullah deal would help bridge. Unless they can manage to bring the security situation that’s deteriorating faster than Iggy Azalea’s career back under control, Afghan troops could have some new bosses very soon. Their current performance doesn’t inspire much hope.\nActually, it’s pretty clear how those forces will perform. In a word? Badly.\nSince the Afghans assumed control of the country’s security in 2014, more civilians have been killed, more soldiers have died, more Afghan troops have deserted than ever before, and security forces are still torturing one-third of their detainees. This is the force Watts and Mann describe as “passably capable” and “resilient.” If by “passably capable” they mean “doesn’t torture too many people,” then sure, I suppose they are “passably capable,” but I think we might want to aim just a bit higher.\nAccording to the Americans, civilian casualties as a result of ground engagements between the Afghans and insurgents were up eight percent for the first three months of 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. In June, Afghan Chief of Army Staff Gen. Qadam Shah Shaheem told his troops that using artillery and conducting night raids against the insurgents was just fine, and no one would be prosecuted as a result. Since most engagements occur among the population when one is countering an insurgency, this change in the rules of engagement means more innocent civilians are going to die as the result of actions by Afghan security forces. That’s borne out by the latest report on civilian casualties from UNAMA, which found that throughout the first half of 2015, Afghan forces caused more civilian casualties than the Taliban did.\nAnd when they’re not busy leveling villages, Afghan forces are dying in record numbers. Throughout the first five months of 2015, security forces casualties were up 70 percent from the same period in 2014. Some of that’s attributable to increasing activity by the insurgents, but a “capable” force doesn’t see that kind of casualty increase unless its capabilities are less than optimal. Even so, the biggest cause of attrition for Afghan troops isn’t being killed in action (KIA). According to a June report by the Americans to Congress, the largest source for attrition is “dropped from rolls” (wherein a soldier stops showing up for work for more than a month so he’s no longer counted), and KIA is the smallest source for Afghan force attrition.\nBut when they do manage to not die and to show up for work, Afghan forces like to spend some quality time with their detainees. A February report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that while torture is on the decrease, around 35 percent of all detainees surveyed reported being tortured in detention. Much of that alleged torture was at the hands of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is similar to the FBI, except that the FBI has better windbreakers and isn’t prone to hooking people up to car batteries unnecessarily. That probably explains why the Americans made it clear in June that no U.S. funds were going to the NDS, even though nearly every other aspect of Afghan defense operations comes directly from American coffers and internal defense is vital for the success of the counterinsurgency.\nIn an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren’t dying in greater numbers, the government isn’t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it—because that’s the country the Americans promised them.\nAn American solution to Afghanistan’s problems faces the struggles of a dwindling security force to keep the Taliban at bay as they strike from sanctuaries in Pakistan, a government on the verge of collapse, and large numbers of civilians being victimized by their own government. And that’s without the growing threat of the Islamic State. In an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren’t dying in greater numbers, the government isn’t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it—because that’s the country the Americans promised them.\nThe reality is that that Afghanistan’s future, while grim, is still better than it was. There is cause for cautious optimism. That does not mean that we shouldn’t be painfully honest about what’s happening in Afghanistan. Given the sacrifices made since 9/11, it’s tempting to do otherwise. But doing so means ignoring challenges the country faces, and the decisions about its future the Americans still need to make."

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- With television lights glaring, 20 lawmakers will gather next week to revisit the fight that consumed Congress before Christmas over renewing a Social Security payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits.\nLittle real work will be done, but the meeting will mark the formal start of an effort to untangle a dispute that both parties want to resolve, though for different reasons. Following is a look at the path Round 2 could take, based on interviews with participants on both sides.\nQ: Can you remind me what's at stake?\nA: After a bitter clash and just a week before a New Year's Day deadline, President Barack Obama and Congress renewed a 2 percentage point payroll tax cut for 160 million workers and benefits for the long-term unemployed through February. They also temporarily forestalled a deep cut in doctors' Medicare fees that threatened to make it harder for the elderly to find physicians who would treat them. Now, the two sides need to figure out how to extend all three measures through 2012 and cover the roughly $160 billion cost.\nQ: Are they expected to succeed?\nA: Yes, though it will probably take until shortly before the current extensions expire Feb. 29. There are complicated decisions ahead, chiefly what programs to cut and what fees to increase to offset the price tag. Just as important, Democrats won't be in a hurry to finish.\nA: Republicans took a severe pounding in December when the House GOP resisted a bipartisan, Senate-approved, two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, which was designed to give lawmakers time to negotiate a longer version. With control of the White House and Congress at stake in the November elections, many Democrats think the GOP could incur further damage if these latest talks take time.\nMany Republicans doubt the economic benefit of a payroll tax cut, a foundation of Obama's plan to create jobs. But as December's battle unfolded, GOP leaders worried that they would suffer political damage from opposing the deeply popular tax cut, worth $1,000 annually to a family earning $50,000 a year.\nWith the House's fractious conservative wing balking until the very end, the fight made the GOP look like it was opposing the tax reduction -- which Democrats contrasted with Republican support for tax breaks for the wealthy. Most Republicans want this year's fight to end quickly so they can change the subject to their own efforts to cut taxes, federal spending and Obama administration regulations.\nQ: How long can Democrats prolong the negotiations?\nA: If they're not careful they could overplay their hand.\nDemocrats scored points last year by forcing Senate votes on their proposal to finance the payroll tax cut with a small surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year. They have a new incentive to do something similar this year with the GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, a wealthy venture capitalist, being cast by party rivals as callous and out of touch.\nAs a result, many Democrats want to begin this year's talks on extending the Social Security tax cut by targeting the wealthy for a tax increase, perhaps with the millionaire surtax or by limiting their deductions. The millionaire surtax has no chance of passage in the GOP-run House, and Democrats could be accused of blatantly playing politics. Democrats and Obama have a reason to cut a deal: They believe extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits will goose the economy and reduce the risk of another economic downturn that could hurt their election prospects.\nQ; What will the 20 members of Congress do?\nA: House and Senate party leaders each have appointed bargainers to hash out differences over the bill, following Congress' tradition of naming conference committees to craft compromise legislation. But as usual when high-profile battles are being resolved, party leaders will have tight control over the ultimate deal. Still, conference committee members will play a role in writing details, and their endorsement of a package would let leaders argue that they didn't jam something down the throats of rank-and-file lawmakers.\nQ: Who are these 20 lawmakers?\nA: They range from formidable committee chairmen to lowly freshmen, but each has a stake in the fight.\nThe chairmen of Congress' two tax-writing committees are included: Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., of the Senate Finance Committee.\nSen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., is the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, facing re-election this fall in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, has repeatedly been given a visible role in the payroll tax fight by party leaders.\nRep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a party leader, should be a leading opponent of Republican proposals to help finance the plan by effectively denying the child tax credit to many illegal immigrants. Freshman GOP Rep. Nan Hayworth is from a closely contested district in New York's Hudson River Valley.\nHayworth and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., are doctors, which could give them roles in the talks involving Medicare. A pair of Maryland Democrats, Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, are sure to battle a Republican proposal to make federal employees contribute more to their pensions.\nQ: Do they bring other experience to the bargaining table?\nA: Seven have participated in recent, failed bipartisan efforts to contain mammoth budget deficits. Those were Congress' supercommittee, talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, the \"Group of Six\" senators, and a presidential commission headed by former Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson and former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, Erskine Bowles.\nNone of those groups succeeded, largely because party leaders could not agree to the controversial tax increases and cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare that would have been required for the trillions of dollars in savings needed.\nFar smaller savings are needed to resolve the payroll tax fight, and the consensus is that this time, the president and leaders in both parties want a package that can become law."

        "text": "But why will this bailout work when an earlier one failed and has Greece now surrendered control of its own economy?\nAfter more than 14 hours of negotiations in Brussels an agreement has been reached on a rescue package to the tune of $170bn that will allow Greece to pay its debts, which are due in less than a month.\nThe deal ensures that Greece will not be forced into defaulting on what it owes in the short term.\n\"It was a bad deal, reached at gunpoint as far as the Greek government is concerned. The new government will have to work around this in order to enhance growth measures and reduce austerity levels because austerity on top of austerity will not do the trick. If you keep milking a cow without feeding it you are not going to end up with the desired results.\"\nDespite reservations over Greece's ability to deliver on austerity measures, eurozone finance ministers have given Athens billions of euros to rescue the country from its financial woes.\nReacting to the second tranche of the bailout, Lucas Papademos, the Greek prime minister, described the day as a historic one for the Greek economy.\n\"With today's decisions, we are given an opportunity to move towards more stable conditions, to reduce the uncertainty which has affected the economic activity and enhance confidence in the prospects of the Greek economy,\" he said.\n\"In this way, the adjustment process of the economy can be facilitated and also better conditions for its recovery can be provided and new jobs can be created.\"\nBut some financial experts argue that once again the can has been kicked down the road to be dealt with later.\nThe conditions of the second bailout include $399m cutbacks in military spending, a $40m saving by reducing staff numbers in central government, and reducing the minimum wage, as well as slashing overtime pay for doctors in public hospitals by at least $66m.\nWhat this means is further budget cuts which are already deeply unpopular with the Greek people who have continuously opposed harsh austerity measures imposed following the first bailout in 2010.\n\"The political system has very low credibility and in order to proceed with these tough measures you need to have credible political personnel, which we are lacking right now. Hopefully there will be an inflow of new people from the private sector. There is a huge debate as to whether the major parties will survive this economic crisis.\"\nAs before, eurozone finance ministers say they want assurances Greece will stick to its promises.\nTheir comments were backed by the contents of a leaked report from the European Commission, the Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe report predicts that Greek debt could stay at a staggering 160 per cent of the country's GDP by 2020, unless drastic changes are made.\nCritics say the new measures to bail out struggling countries have to be matched by economic reforms.\nJan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said: \"When you look at the derailments in Greece which have occurred several times now, it is probably necessary that there is some kind of permanent presence of the troika in Athens, not every three months, but more on a permanent basis. I am in favour of that.\"\nSo why should this bailout work when a previous one has failed, and in accepting the stringent conditions attached, has Greece surrendered control of its own economy?\nTo what extent will this second bailout rescue Greece's shattered economy, at what cost and how is this going to impact Greece's internal politics?\nJoining presenter Mike Hanna on Inside Story are guests: Fokion Zaimis, a small business owner and the CEO of Science Park; Vicky Pryce, a Greek-born economist and the former joint head of the UK government economic service; and Constantine Michalos, an economist and president of the Athens chamber of commerce and industry.\n\"There is already an EU task force here and they are trying to make sure that the various ministries that are important to the economy do the right thing. But there is a concern that actually some of that money will never be spent, it won't be spent correctly, it won't be value for money and it won't benefit the economy.\"\nFinance ministers meeting in Brussels approve $170bn rescue package needed to avoid default by debt-ridden nation."

In the last 3 minutes, they knocked down five three-pointers.\nSophomore guards Anna Blum and Natalie Priest each made two 3s down the stretch. Freshman forward Payton List added one.\nWith 3 seconds left, Priest’s bomb from long distance tied the game, 61-61.\nBut just when it seemed like the game was headed to overtime, Avonworth guard Harris Robinson was fouled just past the midcourt line with less than a second on the clock … 0.2 seconds to be exact.\nShe calmly sank both free throws for a win that put Avonworth (6-3, 4-0) in sole possession of first place.\nHayden Robinson, a 5-foot-10 senior forward who’s going to Quinnipiac University on a track scholarship, led Avonworth with a game-high 22 points.

We got a big game Monday when Neshannock comes to our gym.\nIt was Beaver who handed Neshannock its only section loss, 47-46, on the Lancers’ home court on Dec. 13.\n“Avonworth is really good,” Huston said. “I had them and Neshannock as the top two teams in the section.

        "text": "A Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 Review – Where Is Walter Jones?\nPENCILLERS: Thony Silas, Corin Howell. Cover by Jamal Campbell.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 tells us that before Tommy became Rita Repulsa’s evil Green Ranger, she made a play for Zack, the Black Ranger. After being “upstaged” by Jason during a fight, Goldar and the putties abduct Zack so Rita can make her pitch. Obviously, Zack doesn’t accept. But how do the events of this issue impact Zack’s relationship to the team? And what happens when Zack tells Zordon?\nRita tempting one of the Rangers toward the dark side is such a simple, classic tale. It’s perfect for this series. I’m not sure I wouldn’t have gone with Billy instead of Zack, especially considering the scene we saw in issue #2. He was comparing himself to the others, and he seemed to become self conscious and bitter. If Rita could have seen that, she might have exploited it. On the other hand, we’ve seen some curious behavior from Zack in this series. He’s been very suspicious and apprehensive about Tommy. This issue seems to explain why. This experience gives him a negative connection to the Green Ranger that we never knew about.\nThe Zack we’ve seen in this series isn’t the one I expected. On the show, Walter Jones played a fun-loving dancer. Zack is in love with life, and he’s not afraid to show it. That’s not the character we’ve seen in this series. For the most part he’s been very straight faced. I understand he’s in a very tense storyline. But flashes of personality aren’t going to hurt anything, are they?\nIn essence, what we need in this book is a little more Walter Jones.\nFussy Fanboy Moment: After Zack is abducted, he wakes up in Rita’s Dark Dimension, which we saw in the show. But in one of the “Green Candle” episodes, which these events obviously predate, Jason says he and Tommy are the only Rangers that have been there.\nOn the plus side, Higgins sneaks in what seems to be a hint at Zack going to the Peace Conference later in the series. He tells Zordon, “I need to do more … I don’t care about leading. It’s not like that.” I like that second line. It speaks to why Rita’s plan for Zack doesn’t work. He’s imperfect like anyone else, but in the end he’s selfless. It’s more about the good that’s being done, as opposed to the glory you get from it.\nThe opening sequence, set in Italy, is a lot of fun. The Rangers face Rita’s monstrous take on The Vitruvian Man, who can apparently only speak in da Vinci quotes. Afterward, they receive some fanfare on the ground. We even have the prime minister in the middle of the action. This is yet another example of Higgins doing something that never could have happened on the show.\nThony Silas tags in on pencils for this issue. His style isn’t dramatically different from Hendry Prasetya’s, though his characters are slightly better at emoting. His Rita is particularly sinister. Again, his Zack seems very reserved and stoic, which is not the character we’re used to.\n“The Ongoing Adventures of Bulk & Skull” still doesn’t do much for me. Though we do get a surprise in this issue: The BOOM! Studios debut of Lieutenant Stone, Bulk & Skull’s foil from seasons 3 and 4. I’d always been under the impression they’d never met before. Either way, I’m glad to see the putty patroller story is over. On to (hopefully) better things.\nHiggins pleasantly surprised me with this Zack story, by following up on a plot seed he’d planted as far back as issue #1. It makes you wonder what else he might come back to in future issues. Whether it’s how Billy sees his role on the team, Jason feeling threatened by Tommy, or something else fans may have wondered about. There’s so much fertile ground to cover, and I’m hopeful that we’ve only scratched the surface.\nThis entry was posted in Comic Books/Graphic Novels and tagged Billy Cranston, Black Ranger, BOOM!

        "text": "The City collects garbage weekly from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes. The City has long organized garbage collection services on a ward-by-ward basis. The City assigns the laborers and motor truck drivers who collect garbage in individual wards, where they work on truck routes that do not cross ward boundaries.\nHowever, the City’s recycling pickup is organized based on a regional routing system that does not take into account ward boundaries.\nUnder this option, the City would shift its garbage collection to a regional, grid-based system. By comparing the efficiency of recycling collection with garbage collection, we can estimate what efficiencies might be achieved through a regional, grid-based system of garbage collection.\nAccording to the City’s Mobile Asset Tracking system (CMAT), the City currently has 43 recycling trucks. Assuming that these trucks are all continually operational, the City is providing recycling services to 241,000 households every other week using 43 daily routes.36 The table below compares the difference in annual pickups per daily route of garbage collection and recycling.\nThe table shows that recycling collection, which uses regional routing, averages significantly more pickups per route than garbage collection, which uses the ward system.\nThis is despite the fact that recycling trucks only have one laborer assigned, while some garbage trucks have two. However, garbage collection averages nearly 11 tons collected per daily route per day, while recycling collection averages only 4.65 tons per daily route per day.\nBecause garbage collection is collecting significantly more tonnage per route, workers spend less time collecting because the trucks must make more frequent trips to dump their loads.\nIn 2008, the average load dumped at City-owned dumpsites was 6.65 tons. Based on the average tons collected per route per day, garbage collection averages 1.65 loads per day and recycling averages 0.7 loads per day.\nFor simplicity, assume that garbage collection dumps two loads per day and recycling dumps one load per day, and one load in each program is dumped after the 8-hour collection shift is over through the City’s night shuttle program.\nUnder these assumptions, garbage collection is interrupted by one dump during the 8-hour collection shift, while recycling collection is not. Assuming an average dump takes 1.5 hours, garbage is collected an average of 6.5 hours per route per day, while recycling is collected for the full 8-hour collection shift.\nThe table below compares the estimated pickups per hour for garbage and recycling collection and shows that recycling collection using regional routing is more efficient in terms of pickups per hour than garbage collection based on the ward system.\nIf garbage collection averaged the same number of pickups per hour as recycling collection, the number of daily routes could be reduced to 264, or a 24.6% reduction.\nAssuming that a 24.6% reduction in routes would yield a 24.6% reduction in staffing devoted to garbage collection, the table below details the reduction in personnel and associated personnel costs that would be realized.\nThe table shows that if the City were to move to a grid-based routing system for garbage collection and achieve the same efficiency that the regional routing of recycling is currently achieving, the City might reduce its 2010 personnel costs by up to $24.1 million through the elimination of up to 297 positions.\nBecause of contractual increases in personnel costs, the savings from implementing this option would grow in future years.\nThe 2011 and 2012 salaries of Laborers and Motor Truck Drivers will be higher due to collective bargaining agreements, which call for salary increases of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012.\nAssuming that there are no increases in salaries for the other positions and that the furloughs are continued in their current form, the table below shows the increase in compensation costs over the next two years for the 297 eliminated positions.\nIn addition to the savings from a reduction in the number of daily routes, additional savings could be generated by reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to one laborer per truck.\nWith 264 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 66,000 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 330 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 66,000 routes.\nThis would mean an additional reduction in the number of laborers by 122. At an average compensation of $75,579, their total compensation in 2010 would equal $9.2 million.\nThe 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 122 positions will cost $9.5 million in 2011 and $9.8 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be slightly reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 122 laborers would on average result in 122 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $856,000 in 2011 and $885,000 in 2012.\nAdditionally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off the 269 total sanitation laborers and 110 motor truck drivers, the affected employees would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $3.8 million.\nTherefore, the total estimated savings from switching to regional routing system of garbage collection and reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to 1 would be $29.6 million in 2011 and $34.5 million in 2012.\nOf course, there would be additional savings from reducing the City’s fleet of garbage trucks such as savings in future truck purchases, maintenance costs, gas, oil, etc.\nProponents might argue that organizing garbage collection on a ward-by-ward basis is inefficient and wasteful. They would argue that organizing collection by regional grid would reduce the time it takes for workers to get from the ward yard to the routes and routes could be organized to reduce the distance from route to dumpsite.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform. Additionally, they might cite the fact that Streets and Sanitation decided to organize recycling collection on a regional, grid-based system in order to deliver the service more cheaply.\nOpponents might argue that ward-based system provides better customer service than a more centralized grid system.\nWith ward-by-ward service, City residents have a more direct relationship with the City workers who coordinate garbage collection in their neighborhoods. Some might also argue that garbage collection has long been a primary responsibility of the City’s aldermen and that this has resulted in cleaner streets, timelier pickups, and satisfied residents.\nReduce the Number of Laborers on a Garbage Truck to 1 Savings: $10.3 million in 2011, $12 million in 2012.\nOn some of the City’s garbage trucks, the City assigns two laborers and one motor truck driver..... These employees are responsible for the weekly collection of garbage from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes.\nUntil the last couple of years, the City generally assigned two laborers to each garbage truck. However, due to budget cuts, the City has reduced the number of budgeted sanitation laborers from 816 in 2008 to 599 in 2010. This reduction in laborers means that a significant portion of the 350 daily routes are manned by one laborer.\nUnder this option, the City would further reduce the number of laborers devoted to garbage collection, so that on average one laborer is assigned to each garbage truck.\nWith 350 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 87,500 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 438 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 87,500 routes.\nThis means that the number of laborers could be reduced by approximately 161.50 At an average compensation of $75,579 their total compensation in 2010 would equal $12.2 million. The 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 161 positions will cost $12.6 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 161 laborers would on average result in 161 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $934,000 in 2011 and $967,000 in 2012.\nFinally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off 161 laborers, the affected laborers would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $1.36 million.\nAfter subtracting the reduced savings due to the increased pay for 1-person garbage trucks and the furlough payback provision, the savings from implementing this option would be approximately $10.3 million in 2011 and $12 million in 2012.\nProponents might argue that the City no longer needs two laborers on a garbage truck because the trucks are now semi-automated, meaning garbage carts are lifted and dumped by a mechanism on the back of the trucks.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform.\nOthers might argue that few cities have three staff assigned to each garbage truck. According to 2008 data from the International City/County Management Association’s (ICMA), among the six jurisdictions with over 500,000 people which submitted data only one (San Antonio) had 3 staff per garbage vehicle, and this is likely because collection is done manually.\nThe other five jurisdictions (Phoenix, Miami-Dade County, Dallas, Austin, and Oklahoma City) all had 1 person per vehicle and automated or semi-automated collection.\nOpponents might argue that reducing the number of laborers to one on all garbage trucks would reduce the quality of collection service in the City. They would argue that reducing the number of laborers could result in less frequent service as it takes trucks longer to perform their routes.\nAdditionally, others might argue that in addition to their collection responsibilities, laborers sweep alleys, pick up trash, or remove street-sweeping signs. Reducing the number of laborers would mean a reduction in these services.\nSimple. Organize the wards on a grid system, rather than gerrymandered as they are now. Makes the garbage collection more efficient, while keeping it in the hands of the aldermen.\nThe trucks on the Far North Side are picking up less garbage than a year ago.\nI know this because while they're leaving the garage on Ravenswood Ave. at the same time every morning, they're coming back for the day way before they used to. Now they return as early as 2 PM, while a year ago it was at 3 PM. All the workers cars are gone by 3 PM now, it used to take until 4 PM last year.\nThe only explanation for the ward by ward system appears to be the very least paragraph which to me seems pretty flimsy. How are the residents' or aldermen's relationships with the city workers stronger if they don't cross ward boundaries on any given day? They still have to pick up their garbage every week? I don't get that at all.\n---I also found it interesting that the city apparently picks up about twice the tonnage of trash than it does recycling. In the superboonies where I live, the ratio is more than twice the opposite. We have two wheeled containers for each house; one for recycling, and a somewhat larger one for trash. We fill the recycling container each week, and the trash container has a few things in the bottom of it; some garbage, contaminated paper not suitable for recycling, used facial tissues, the occasional diaper when the grandchildren come visiting. The city's ratio is possibly a residuum of the blue bag program; people just aren't used to a serious recycling program yet.\nAnd oh yes: the collection trucks have a claw on the side that picks up the container, upends it and dumps it. One man per truck, and he never has to get out.\nCut down on high absenteeism while you're at it.\nI lived in Chicago until 1975 and knew that if you wanted to guarantee that the old loveseat or refrigerator that you hauled out to your alley were to be picked up it was a good idea to meet the garbage truck with maybe a cold six pack in a brown bag or possibly a $5 bill discreetly passed to the driver. Actually, you could give it to any one of the three or four'workers' who either drove, rode on the back of, or walked along behind, the truck. Since then I've lived in the suburbs (Alsip, Justice, Worth, Lockport) and have enjoyed simple, cost effective trash collection by various private refuse companies. I have never, in more than 35 years, had to call to complain about the service I've received. This includes picking up couchs, freezers, construction waste or trees. If there's a holiday, flood, blizzard or any other form of delay they're there the day after the normal pick-up day, never later. The most amazing part is, all of this is done by one worker, and has been for the last 20 years. So, until somebody in city government grows a pair and finally decides to attack the real problem, this totally wasteful practice will continue."

        "text": "Az Zallaqa, JNIM’s media branch, branded with other official al Qaeda media wings.\nIn a recently released video, the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) – a jihadist group primarily based in West Africa and the Sahel – went to great lengths to portray its fight against Mali and France as conjoined with al Qaeda’s global jihad. Speeches and footage from several al Qaeda leaders from around the world were shown interlaced with combat footage from the African jihadist group.\nAt the very beginning of the video, JNIM showed its media division, Az Zallaqa, as being in the same family as other al Qaeda media wings. This includes As Sahab (al Qaeda central’s media division), Al Malahem (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), Al Kata’ib (Shabaab), and al Andalus (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). By putting its media wing alongside other media branches of the global jihadist organization, JNIM is portraying Az Zallaqa as another official al Qaeda media organization.\nThis is important as some have categorized JNIM as merely being “linked” or “affiliated” with al Qaeda. However, JNIM clearly sees itself on equal footing with al Qaeda’s official branches around the world.\nAs the video progresses, JNIM depicts its conflict in Mali as being the same conflict seen in various places around the world, such as Nigeria, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. Various killed al Qaeda leaders, such as Osama bin Laden, Nasir al Wuyashi, Anwar al Awlaki, Ibn Khattab, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, Abu al Hasan al Rashid al Bulaydi, Abdelhamid Abu Zeid, Abu Firas al Suri, and Muhammad al Zahawi, are shown in a eulogy segment.\nA speech from Sulayman Abu al Ghaith, a former al Qaeda spokesman who is now serving a life sentence in the US, can be heard over footage of combat from JNIM. “God ordered us to protect the vulnerable, so we protect the vulnerable. God ordered us to terrorize the apostates, so we terrorize the apostates. God ordered us to kill the leaders of disbelief, so we kill the leaders of disbelief,” al Ghaith said as he linked al Qaeda’s jihad to “protecting the vulnerable” around the world.\nThe message then shifted to lambasting both Mali and France for their efforts to combat the jihadist group in the West African country. JNIM used English-speaking political commentators to suggest France’s involvement in Mali is a large conspiracy as part of a wider war against Islam. A JNIM official identified as Abdul Hakim al Muhajir [implying he is a foreign fighter] reiterated in this point in a long-winded tirade against France.\n“France’s war on Muslims in the region is not a economic war … it is between faith and apostasy, and Islam and idolatry,” al Muhajir stated in his speech. That theme was common for JNIM and its predecessor groups in Mali, as it painted France as an occupying force oppressing Muslims in a war against Islam. Speeches and statements from various JNIM leaders, including Iyad Ag Ghaly and Yahya Abu al Hammam – its emir and deputy emir respectively – have focused on this exact trope in the last three years.\nYahya Abu al Hammam continued that trend by also making a short speech against France and the G5 Sahel forces operating in Mali. This was immediately before showing suicide bombers and an assault team training for the April 14 suicide assault on the joint UN-French base in Timbuktu. One actual UN peacekeeper was killed in that attack, while at least 10 others were wounded during the assault. France confirmed seven of its soldiers were also wounded. Additionally, the French military reported at least 15 jihadists were killed.\nDespite a French counter-terrorism operation, UN troops, and troops from the G5 Sahel, JNIM remain a potent threat within Mali. Its violence has also been continuously shifting further south within Mali, as well as pouring into neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso and Niger."

NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world and over the last five years URMC has received approximately $789 million in research funding from the organization.\nCollins traveled to Rochester to deliver a positive message: it is an extremely exciting time for biomedical research. In a keynote address to faculty members, staff, students, trainees and alumni, he detailed several new NIH initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot and the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. He highlighted the work of David C. Linehan, M.D., director of clinical operations at UR Medicine’s Wilmot Cancer Institute and Chair of Surgery at URMC who is studying new immune therapies for pancreatic cancer, as well as Thomas O’Connor, Ph.D., professor of Psychiatry and director of the Wynne Center for Family Research at URMC who is among a group of scientists studying prenatal inflammation and child health as part of ECHO.\n“We are in a time of such amazing diversity of opportunity, with people working in fields that maybe weren’t even invented 20 years ago, making advances in basic, translational and clinical science and everything in between,” said Collins, a physician-geneticist noted for his landmark discoveries of disease genes and his leadership of the international Human Genome Project.\nTurning scientific discoveries into new treatments for patients is priority for the NIH and Collins applauded URMC on its new $19 million grant to continue the “bench-to-bedside” research taking place at the University’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Collins cited translational research conducted by cardiologist Arthur J. Moss, M.D., which has led to new treatments for patients with Long QT syndrome (LQTS), and infectious disease expert John J. Treanor, M.D., which is helping scientists in pursuit of a universal flu vaccine.\nAfter many lean years, Collins reported that the NIH budget is increasing and outlined several new funding initiatives, such as the NIH Director’s Early Independence Award, which is helping Elaine L. Hill, Ph.D.,assistant professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences study the impact of fracking on infant and child health.\nCollins’ trip to the Medical Center included an intimate discussion with graduate students and junior researchers about the importance of communicating science to the public and policymakers, increasing diversity in biomedical research and mechanisms to support young scientists at the start of their careers. Members of the Center for RNA Biology highlighted their most promising work for Collins and Center director Lynne E. Maquat, Ph.D. gave Collins a tour of her lab, where he met more trainees and junior researchers (admittedly, Collins’ favorite part of visits like these).\nCongresswoman Louise M.

        "text": "WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Colin Powell (search) has been evasive about his future, skirting questions about the timing of his widely expected departure after four rough-and-tumble years as America&apos;s chief diplomat.\nIn dozens of interviews, Powell has dismissed questions about his plans by saying with a smile, \"I serve at the pleasure of the president.\"\nPowell has long been considered to be a one-term secretary of state, irrespective of whether Bush was re-elected. Speculation has been rife for months about possible successors in a second Bush term. Among those mentioned are national security adviser Condoleezza Rice (search) and U.N. Ambassador John Danforth (search).\nLast July, Bush suggested during an appearance in Philadelphia that he would be happy if Powell were to remain on. The remark went virtually unnoticed by the media but caught the attention of Powell aides.\nDuring a September interview with The Associated Press, Powell was asked whether he considered Bush&apos;s comment to be an invitation for him to stay on.\n\"Time will tell. We will see,\" Powell replied.\nWhen asked Wednesday about Powell&apos;s plans, his spokesman, Richard Boucher, reverted to the usual language about \"serving at the pleasure of the president.\"\nOne possibility would be for Powell to stay on for a brief period until after the national elections in Iraq, which are supposed to be held before the end of January 2005.\nAs analysts see it, a post-Iraq election departure for Powell would make more sense than one that could occur just days before the balloting in Iraq but after Bush&apos;s second term begins.\nAt a minimum, Bush&apos;s re-election means a series of foreign trips Powell plans will take on a more serious cast than they would have if Sen. John Kerry had prevailed Tuesday.\nAnd the Bush victory means that his own trip to an Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Chile before Thanksgiving will involve substantive exchanges rather than farewell handshakes and polite banter.\nThe 20 or so Asia-Pacific leaders invited there will be eager to hear what Bush has in mind for the region in his second term.\nFor his part, Powell will travel to Mexico on Monday for an overnight visit. The following week, he plans to spend four days in Chile as part of the U.S. summit entourage. He then will fly to Egypt for a major international conference on Iraq&apos;s future, a meeting Powell hopes to use to expand international cooperation for Iraq.\nHe also will attend a NATO meeting in Brussels in December and possibly meetings of other trans-Atlantic groups in Europe. In addition, Powell will attend a meeting in Morocco next month to push the Bush administration&apos;s pro-democracy agenda for Arab countries.\nIn the coming days, Powell will be boning up on issues involving Mexico ahead of his Monday visit. Mexican officials will be eager to hear more about Bush&apos;s proposal to provide legal status — at least on a temporary basis — for millions of undocumented aliens in the United States. Mexico is the principal source of such migrants.\nRenewable three-year work permits would be available for them if they can prove that they have a job and meet other criteria. Mexico strongly supports the initiative.\nBush proposed it last January but little has been heard about it since.\nIf Congress approves, officials say the new rules will make America safer by helping for the first time to document migrants who have no legal standing in the United States."

We must never forget that Sinn Fein were willing and enthusiastic apologists for decades of human rights abuses perpetrated by the IRA.\n“It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is less about recognition and more about trying to impose an ideology that decades of brutal terror could not.\nLord Empey also accused the republican party of “desperately trying to pursue De Valera’s ideal of recreating a mythical nation of true bred gaels, fluent in their ancient tongue – a tongue precious few of them can speak”.\nHe added: “The sub-text is clear. Those who do not speak Irish or who do not regard it as part of their identity and heritage are not truly Irish.\nIn his article, Mr Kearney also wrote: “An Ireland of equals will only come about once partition has been ended and a national democracy is achieved.\nTUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Kearney’s comments should demonstrate to unionists that “Stormont for Sinn Fein is a waiting room for Irish unity”."

Cameras captured Markle and Prince Harry holding hands as they walked into an event celebrating the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Youth Leadership Workshop in London on July 5 at Marlborough House.\nAt the event, Prince Harry gave a brief speech while Markle looked on, dressed to stand out in a sunshine-yellow dress. She was snapped enjoying the day’s activities, as Harry — a Commonwealth Youth Ambassador — extolled their joint interest in getting to know the leaders being recognized.\nSo why is holding hands so noteworthy? Hand holding can be a fraught practice in the world of royal etiquette. While there is no official rule outlawing the clasp, there are situations — depending on the formality of the event — in which it can be perceived as a no-no, as former royal butler Grant Harrold previously explained to TIME. But while Harry’s older brother Prince William and Kate Middleton tend to go “by the book” when it comes to their behavior with each other, Prince Harry has some leeway to go about “re-writing the etiquette rules” for a younger generation.\nNot that there aren’t instances where the pair hasn’t held hands. Just last week, for instance, a video at a formal event with the Queen stirred conversation about public displays of affection for the royal family."

        "text": "As the crow flies Denniff’s Cottage on Ringarogey island in Roaring Water Bay is just a few minutes’ boat ride to Baltimore, Co Cork. In contrast, the scenic route is by car, a journey time around the winding roads, of about 20 minutes.\nThe island, which is joined to the mainland by a stone bridge, part of famine relief work in the mid-19th century, is one of many in an archipelago that includes the better-known isles of Sherkin and Hare.\nOne of its owners, Pat McKnight, then Denniff, hence the name, bought it in 1974 when west Cork was beginning to flourish as an alternative location. Her parents had had a place in the cove in Baltimore since the 1950s. After a drink with estate agent Charles McCarthy in the Algiers Inn in Baltimore, her husband Tim McKnight recalls that locals couldn’t believe that she paid IR£14,500 for a farmhouse on a sprawling parcel of about 16 acres looking out across the estuary of the Ilen river to the islands of Sherkin and, on a clear day, Cape Clear.\nThe property, which dates back to the mid-19th century, is charming in every way. The back door, the one in daily use by its owners, is an old half-door and leads straight into the living room, one of the rooms in the original part of the house.\nHere the beamed ceiling height is low, about 7.5ft. It has an inglenook fireplace set into a bare stone wall, where a wood-burning stove has been installed. Underfoot is a slate floor which was damp-proofed in 2010 as part of extensive works carried out by the owners.\nThe works included rebuilding the kitchen and interconnecting dining room, a gorgeous space with windows on three sides and leading out to a south-facing patio.\nUpstairs there are four bedrooms, accessed via a waxed timber balustrade staircase leading up from the sitting room.\nThe main house extends to about 185sq m/2,000sq ft, and is seeking €830,000 through Charles McCarthy. The lands extend down to the sea where there is a small pontoon and mooring, includes several outhouses, one a potter’s studio which, subject to planning, could become a smart self-contained holiday rental. A second building is used as a boathouse.\nCoincidentally. the Algiers Inn is also for sale, seeking around €350,000 through agent Cohalan Downing."

        "text": "Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, entered a lobby elevator at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York on Saturday.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said he would deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants when he takes office, but he also appeared to soften some of his campaign pledges and took a major step toward the GOP establishment by naming Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus as his future chief of staff.\nIn Trump’s first television interview since Election Day, the billionaire businessman told “60 Minutes” that he will deport or incarcerate “the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,’’ but at the same time he appeared to leave open the possibility that other undocumented immigrants would be allowed to stay in the United States.\n“After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are going to make a determination at that,” Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday night.\nBy choosing Priebus as his chief of staff, Trump went with a mainstream, traditional choice, preferred by Washington insiders.\nA Wisconsin native, Priebus, 44, is known to have close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who would be a key ally in getting Trump’s agenda through Congress. Priebus remained largely loyal to Trump during his unorthodox campaign, although he sometimes struggled to defend the nominee’s many statements about treatment of women and minorities.\nA Globe analysis of the state’s election results showed a reddening of the state’s western counties.\nPriebus, supporters suggest, is a Republican Party loyalist who will bring D.C. experience and political acumen to a White House lacking both. He was chosen over a much more controversial, and less-well known, candidate: Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News and the chief strategist of the Trump campaign. Bannon has a history of using his prominence to support anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and racist messages, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog group.\nIn the Trump administration, Bannon will serve as a chief strategist and senior counselor to the president.\n“Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,” Trump said in the announcement.\nThe developments come at an extraordinarily divisive period in American politics.\nPresident-elect Trump with Reince Priebus on election night. Priebus will serve as chief of staff in Trump’s White House.\nIn urban centers, protesters are speaking out against the presidential election, decrying the bombastic — and sometimes offensive — rhetoric that Trump used during the election season. Republicans, though giddy at the prospect of a conservative White House, Congress, and Supreme Court, are also unclear on just how much of Trump’s lofty campaign promises he will attempt to fulfill.\nIndeed, in the “60 Minutes” interview, Trump signaled that part of his promised wall at the Mexico border — a signature pledge during his campaign — might actually be a fence.\nElsewhere on Sunday, Republican leaders also seemed to back away from some of Trump’s policy promises, including jailing Clinton, building the border wall, and implementing a deportation force.\nSpeaking on Fox News, the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said he does not expect Congress to push any further investigations of Clinton, despite the often-repeated rallying cry of “Lock her up!” at Trump’s rallies. McCarthy also expressed skepticism at the idea of mass deportations.\n‘‘First thing you have to do is secure the border and then we’ll have discussions,” McCarthy said.\nRyan, the House speaker who has rallied behind Trump after months of carefully putting distance between himself and the nominee, was more direct than McCarthy.\n“I think we should put people’s minds at ease. That is not what our focus is,” said Ryan, of Wisconsin.\nRyan’s words and the seemingly moderated tone of the president-elect might not calm the fears of Democrats, protesters nationwide, and historically marginalized communities, many of which felt demonized throughout the Trump campaign.\nSome left-leaning activists have reacted to Trump’s election by rushing to social media to claim Trump is #NotMyPresident, despite the looming truth of Inauguration Day. Others, such as US Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, accepted the election results but pledged to hold Trump accountable for the divisive rhetoric he at times deployed.\nThis sentiment, coupled with a recent flare of incidents in which self-described Trump voters were harassing people of different cultures, has received a mixed reaction from Trump’s closest advisers — and the president-elect himself.\nTrump has made clear that he intends to use Twitter to get his message out, and he continued to snipe at the media over the weekend.\nStephen Bannon, whom Donald Trump named his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist, at Trump Tower Saturday.\n“Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena,’” Trump wrote in a tweet posted at 3 a.m. Sunday.\nIn the “60 Minutes” interview, Trump explained that he uses Twitter to “get the word out’’ and go around traditional media outlets.\n“When you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,” Trump said, “I have a method of fighting back.” He vowed to be “very restrained” in his Twitter posts.\nOn the Sunday morning political talk shows, Trump’s surrogates and advisers downplayed the nationwide anger that continued to surface since his surprising win. Instead, each attempted to recast Trump as a political unifier, a humbled leader capable of compromise and willing to govern for all Americans.\nThere is one area in which Democrats and Republicans agree: the need for Trump to sign a robust law investing in the country’s infrastructure.\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, mentioned public works projects on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” Sunday, and on CBS News, Senator Bernie Sanders highlighted infrastructure as one area of possible common ground.\n“Let’s see the details. But, in general, rebuilding our infrastructure is absolutely imperative for this country,” said Sanders, an independent of Vermont.\nSanders cautioned Trump against claiming any electoral mandate from Tuesday’s results, since Clinton received more votes nationally than Trump.\n“We are the majority,” Sanders said.\nAstead W.

        "text": "What are neutrophils and what do they do?\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps heal damaged tissues and resolve infections. Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions.\nNeutrophils help prevent infections by blocking, disabling, digesting, or warding off invading particles and microorganisms. They also communicate with other cells to help them repair cells and mount a proper immune response.\nThe body produces neutrophils in the bone marrow, and they account for 55–70 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream. A normal overall white blood cell level in the bloodstream for an adult is somewhere between 4,500 and 11,000 per millimeters cubed (mm3).\nWhen there is an infection or another source of inflammation in the body, special chemicals alert mature neutrophils, which then leave the bone marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the site in need.\nUnlike some other cells or blood components, neutrophils can travel through junctions in the cells that line blood vessel walls and enter into tissues directly.\nIn this article, we look at the reasons for high or low neutrophil levels, how doctors can test these levels, and what normal neutrophil levels are for different groups.\nThere are many different reasons why a person may have higher or lower than normal levels of neutrophils in their blood.\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell.\nHaving an abnormally high level of neutrophils in the blood is known as neutrophilic leukocytosis, also known as neutrophilia.\nSome inflammatory conditions can increase neutrophil levels, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, and vasculitis.\nAn abnormally low blood level of neutrophils is a condition called neutropenia.\nA drop in neutrophil blood levels typically occurs when the body uses immune cells faster than it produces them or the bone marrow is not producing them correctly.\nAn enlarged spleen may also cause a decrease in neutrophil levels because the spleen traps and destroys neutrophils and other blood cells.\nA laboratory specialist can evaluate a blood sample for white blood cell levels.\nDoctors can identify changes in neutrophil levels from a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, which identifies specific groups of white blood cells.\nA doctor may order a CBC test when someone is experiencing a range of symptoms related to infection, chronic illness, and injury, such as fever, pain, and exhaustion. A nurse or technician will draw a small amount of blood from the arm and send it off for evaluation.\nIf the initial test shows a higher or lower number of white blood cells than normal, the doctor will likely repeat the test to confirm the results. If the initial results are confirmed, a doctor will perform a physical exam, ask questions about the person's lifestyle, and review their medical history.\nIf there is no apparent reason for changes in white blood cell levels, the doctor will order a more specific test. Laboratory specialists will look for specific white blood cells, such as immature neutrophils called myeloblasts. During an infection or chronic illness, these cells emerge from the bone marrow and mature in the blood instead of the bone marrow.\nIf myeloblasts or other white blood cells appear in significant levels in the blood, the doctor will request a bone marrow sample.\nBone marrow collection involves inserting a long needle into part of the pelvis near the back of your hip. The procedure can be very painful, and a doctor will typically take the sample in a hospital setting with at least a local anesthetic.\nExperts will examine the bone marrow sample to see if neutrophils and other blood cells are developing correctly and are in regular supply.\nLeukopenia is a condition where a person has a reduced white blood cell levels in their bloodstream. Learn about the causes, symptoms, and treatments here.\nChanges in neutrophil levels are often a sign of more significant changes in white blood cell levels.\nIn non-pregnant adults, a white blood cell blood count over 11,000 per mm3 is known as leukocytosis, which is an elevated white blood cell count. Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs when a person has over 7,000 per mm3 mature neutrophils in their bloodstream.\nMinor changes in neutrophil or white blood cell levels are typically nothing to worry about as long as they are temporary. A raised white blood cell count often means the body is responding to infection, injury, or stress.\nSome people have naturally lower levels of white blood cells and neutrophils than other people due to a range of factors, including congenital conditions.\nIf neutrophil or white blood cell levels are significantly altered for no apparent reason or remain raised or lowered, a doctor will order more tests to determine the cause.\nSeverely high or low levels of white blood cells often require emergency care and monitoring. People with severe neutropenia will have an inadequate defense against infection.\nPeople with severe neutrophilia typically have a life-threatening type of infection or other inflammatory illness that requires treatment, such as cancer.\nNutritional yeast is a plant-based source of vitamin B-12.\nThe best way to correct abnormal neutrophil levels is to address and treat the underlying cause.\nAntibiotics can treat bacterial infections, while antifungal medicine treats fungal infections. People can treat certain viral infections with medications that slow viral activity. Otherwise, supportive therapies, such as fluids and rest, may be part of the treatment plan.\nPeople with altered neutrophil levels caused by medications or procedures may need to stop or adjust treatments.\nPeople with severely low levels of neutrophils often require monitoring, antibiotic therapy, and hospitalization to reduce the risk of severe infection.\nThis period of intensive care helps keep people with weakened immune systems away from potentially harmful microorganisms. It also supports the body, giving it time to produce more white blood cells.\nTry not to over-exercise or exercise beyond comfort levels.\nReduce stress levels and treat chronic or severe stress.\nSeek medical attention for signs of infection, such as fever, weakness, fatigue, or pain, and treat infections exactly as prescribed.\nFollow a healthful, balanced diet.\nTreat chronic conditions, such as genetic or inflammatory conditions, exactly as prescribed.\nHowever, people with only minor or mild changes in their neutrophil blood levels often show no symptoms and do not require any treatment.\nHaving a healthy number of neutrophils in the blood and bone marrow is crucial to the correct working of the immune system.\nWhen neutrophil levels are higher or lower than usual for more than a short period, a doctor will order several tests to work out the underlying cause. People with significantly altered neutrophil levels may also require hospitalization to prevent infection and treat life-threatening conditions.\nIt is a good idea to have regular wellness checks at a doctor's office to stay on top of health. Anyone with concerns about their neutrophil count or any medical condition should talk to their doctor who will be able to answer questions they may have.\nHuizen, Jennifer. \"What are neutrophils and what do they do?.\" Medical News Today.

Use of computers and cellphones is linked to higher levels of mental and physical well-being among those over age 80, according to new Stanford research.\nAnd these elders — dubbed “the oldest old,” a generation typically ignored by the youth-obsessed tech industry — are motivated for the same reasons as digital-savvy millennials: to stay connected.\n“Using tech to connect with loved ones was related to higher life satisfaction, lower loneliness and general attainment of meaningful goals — being happy, independent,” said researcher Tamara Sims of the Stanford Center on Longevity.\nThose who used technology to learn new information were in better physical health, her study also found.\nExpansion of elder-focused tech education and support could help those born in an era of Greta Garbo, Model T cars and vacuum tube radio, said Sims.\nAmericans are living longer than previous generations, and many want to stay at home. With digital tools, they can stay socially engaged — and reach out for help, if they need it.\nEvery morning, after his second cup of coffee, he answers emails about the war and his organization. Then he does research, which helps him stay abreast of any newly published academic studies. He also uses his PC to plan upcoming seminars — honoring the centennial of America’s engagement in the war — seeking conference venues, speakers and nearby hotels.\nHe searches the web to find images for his World War I lectures to civic groups and schools, and then puts his presentation on a thumb drive for travel.\nHam radio operator Rudy Bahr, 93, of Mountain View uses a computer program that, in an earthquake or other crisis, can communicate radio messages directly to emergency operation centers, hospitals and other critical facilities. Created by the volunteer-run Southern Peninsula Emergency Communications System, it offers a direct connection that is more reliable than traditional email or cell services.\nSaratoga’s Tsing Bardin, 78, and her husband, 85, use FaceTime with their children and grandchildren in Italy and in New York. “It is free and you can see them as you speak,” she said.\nGoogle Calendar is the tool used by 91-year-old Lois Hall, of Palo Alto, to book appointments for one-on-one tech tutoring of other elders at a Computer Learning Center, sponsored by Palo Alto’s senior center Avenidas. She also uses computers to create informational fliers.\nShe cherishes newsy or humorous emails from her son in San Jose and daughter in Cupertino. She also uses email to plan monthly dinners with friends.\nShe uses Netflix to watch new episodes of the Canadian drama “Heartland.” With the holidays approaching, she’ll use it for shopping.\nSims didn’t expect to find much of a correlation between technology and well-being in adults older than 80 because these elders were considered to be the most unfamiliar with these technologies and the least likely to use them.\nConventional wisdom holds that as people age, they perceive time as more limited — and prioritize meaningful interactions with their loved ones rather than learning new information or meeting new people.\n“I was going into it a little bit skeptical,” according to Sims, whose research is published in the current issue of the Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences. She conducted the study with Andrew Reed, a former Stanford postdoctoral fellow, and Dawn Carr, an assistant professor of sociology at Florida State University.\nThe research team surveyed 445 people between the ages of 80 and 93, online and over the phone. Elders were asked about their motivation for using cellphones, personal computers, video streaming services and other digital tools.\nContrary to stereotypes, most of the adults over 80 said they used at least one technological device regularly, and doing so was related to higher levels of self-reported physical and mental well-being, reported Sims.\n“The key here is that if you get them using these technologies, we could probably see some real benefits to quality of life in very old age,” she said, in a prepared statement.\nInterviewed elders said that tech tools could be improved to ease their use.\nAnother common frustration, said Hall, is navigation — for instance, learning how to move photos from iPads and iPhones to the computer. When she sets up tutoring sessions, she matches elders with specific questions to volunteers with that type of expertise.\nShe, too, was initially stumped — but with time, patience and training, improved."

        "text": "Apple's new Music Memos app captures musical inspiration, while GarageBand adds a new AI drummer and loop arranger.\nWhen a bolt of musical inspiration hits, many musicians will reach for their smart phones, pop open the built-in voice-recorder app, and make a quick recording of some combination of guitar, voice or piano, hoping to capture the essence of the idea before it fades.\nBut a voice memo is a blunt tool for capturing a song idea, and the artist is left on their own to figure out how to translate a rough recording into something more substantial -- or even to remember what chords were played.\nPress this big button to record.\nEnter Music Memos, a new iOS app from Apple. This simple app is a new type of voice-memo recorder, built around capturing musical ideas, giving them a slight polish, and sending the best ones on to a more powerful music tool, such as Apple's own GarageBand or Logic Pro. It's completely free, and should be available on the App Store later today.\nMusic Memos starts with a simple record button in the middle of the screen. Tap it and the app starts recording -- it's optimized for guitar or piano, but you could really record anything: voice, ukulele, klezmer, whatever, although other instruments may miss out on some of the advanced features.\nTrim and loop the recording and edit the chord information here.\nIt's what happens next that makes Music Memos stand out from a standard memo-recording app. If you recorded some acoustic guitar or piano, Music Memos analyses the audio input and attempts to chop your song demo into bars, in the appropriate time signature, and then adds chord labels.\nYou can tweak the recording a good deal, trimming the start and end to form a loop, and overwriting the chord information with your own notations. In practice, I found it worked best with strummy, coffee-shop open chords in 4/4 time. Trying to get a little more complex, such as throwing in jazzy major-7th chords, forced me to manually enter the appropriate chords for each bar.\nSongs can be exported to GarageBand or shared via services including SoundCloud and email.\nBut once that's all set, you can turn on the surprisingly satisfying auto-accompaniment tools, and a simple bass line and drum track will follow along with the rhythm and chords, like a bare-bones backing band. It offers just a few basic beats, and again seems targeted at the strummy, coffee-shop singer-songwriter crowd, but it's also very satisfying to hear a fleshed-out version of a song idea almost instantly.\nSong ideas can also be labeled with tags, and you can add comments or even song lyrics to a notes section for each recording. Music Memo recordings can be synced to iCloud, or you can export the actual files to GarageBand or Logic Pro in order to work on them further in a more full-featured music app.\nThe next step up from Music Memos is GarageBand, Apple's consumer-friendly music recording and editing program. Included on most iOS and OS X devices, it takes an iMovie-like approach to recording, throwing out some of the traditional user interfaces found in programs such as ProTools or Apple's own Logic Pro (which were, in turn, copied from actual real-world recording studios), and instead creating a new, hopefully more intuitive, way to record music.\nHaving used old-school music DAWs (shorthand for \"digital audio workstations,\" a term used to describe computer-based recording programs) such as ProTools and Logic extensively over the years, I've always found the GarageBand approach hard to wrap my head around. But, this new 2.1 update adds some interesting new features that make it easier than ever to get started crafting or arranging music, even if you have little or no experience.\nThe Live Loops interface in GarageBand.\nThe most notable is an entirely new (and entirely optional) interface called Live Loops. It's a performance-friendly sequencer for arranging samples and loops, which can be lined up to play in order, or simply triggered on the fly by tapping on the appropriate square-shaped loop. Apple includes several preloaded templates in different music genres, or you can start with a blank field and import various loops and samples, or original recordings made in GarageBand. With the right tempo and note information (routinely included with commercial samples and loops) the Live Loops interface keeps all the parts in sync and flowing together naturally.\nThe idea reminds me of performance-friendly music programs such as Ableton Live, but this version is much more pick-up-and-play, and my four-year-old was having a great time with it, triggering samples and creating on-the-fly arrangements in under a minute. Live Loops is fun to play with, but probably more useful for live improvisation from the DJ booth or creating EDM arrangements than traditional songwriting and recording.\nOutside of Live Loops, there's also the standard music recording and editing tools in GarageBand, augmented by some new automation features and EQ tools for tweaking the overall sound.\nYou can still record audio via an external mic or your device's built-in mic (although the latter is not really recommended) or play virtual guitars and keyboards on-screen, which is fun but involves a lot of trial and error to get a feel for. \"Smart\" versions of these instruments will play preset patterns based on chord information you provide. That can give you an instant backing band for ideas, but again, there's a robotic sameness to the performances and the styles are on the dry side, so it's not going to replace calling your musically talented friends up and asking them to play on your album.\nNew for GarageBand 2.1 is the addition of Drummer, a high-concept AI drum tool previously found only in the $200 Logic Pro software. Drummer starts with several fictional drummer profiles, each with his or her own music genres and drum kits, and builds a drum track for your song that can be adjusted on the fly to be louder, softer, more or less complex, using different cymbal or kick/snare variations, and with more or fewer fills. The end result is pretty good, and much more human-feeling than basic drum loops or samples. Although, again, the genre choices tend to run towards EDM, straightforward rock, and commercial-sounding hip-hop/R&B. I'm still waiting for a specialized bossa nova drummer, or a virtual version of Bernard Purdie.\nThe Drummer app inside GarageBand.\nMusic Memos is for free for iOS users and will work on iPhone 4s and later, and iPad 2 and later. GarageBand 2.1 for iOS will be included on new iOS devices with 32GB or more of storage, and owners of previous versions can upgrade for free if they have iOS 9."

        "text": "President Barack Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office last Thursday, after the two met to discuss the presidential transition.\nDonald Trump's victory in the race for the White House leaves widespread uncertainty about what's in store for public schools under the first Republican administration in eight years. Aside from school choice, Trump, a New York-based real estate developer who has never before held public office, spent little time talking about K-12 education during his campaign. And he has no record to speak of on the issue for insights into what he may propose.\n\"We're all engaging in a lot of speculation because there hasn't been a lot of serious discussion about this, especially in the Trump campaign,\" Martin R. West, an associate professor of education at Harvard University, said in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election. West has advised Republicans, including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, on education.\nTrump did propose a $20 billion plan to dramatically expand school choice for low-income students. It would use federal money to help them attend private, charter, magnet, and regular public schools of their choice. It's also designed to leverage additional state investments in school choice of up to $100 billion nationwide.\nIn the campaign, the president-elect also embraced merit pay for teachers, without offering details beyond saying he found it unfair that \"bad\" teachers sometimes earned \"more than the good ones.\" And, on the early-childhood front, he's pitched offering six weeks of maternity leave to women who do not get it through their employers, expanding the availability of dependent-care savings accounts, and offering tax incentives for employers to provide on-site day care.\nBut otherwise, the Trump campaign mostly dealt in sound bites with such controversial issues as the Common Core State Standards, the possibility of getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, and gun-free school zones.\n\"I could really see him trying to minimize any role [of the federal government in education],\" Nat Malkus, a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in contemplating the implications of a Trump presidency ahead of the vote.\nWhile education is not a high-profile issue politically at the moment, it's not as if the Trump administration won't have anything to do on school policy.\nAt or near the top of the K-12 to-do list is how the new administration handles the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, the latest version of the flagship federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act that was first passed in 1965. The Education Department under President Barack Obama is relatively close to finalizing ESSA regulations governing how states hold schools accountable and how districts must show they are using federal money to supplement their state and local school budgets.\nRepublicans in Congress have been critical of both sets of proposals from the department, particularly the one governing the supplemental-money rule. In fact, 25 GOP lawmakers recently asked the department to rescind its proposal for ensuring federal funds are supplemental, not a replacement for state and local money, on the grounds that the proposal would give the department too much power over state and local budget decisions.\nThe incoming administration may be on the same page as those lawmakers, said Gerard Robinson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former state schools chief in Virginia and Florida.\n\"I think [Trump's] secretary of education will handle it differently than what we've seen from [current Secretary] John King,\" regarding the so-called supplement-not-supplant rules, Robinson said. Robinson is serving as a member of the Trump transition team, but spoke only on his own behalf.\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton focused more on early education and college affordability than K-12 in her losing bid for the White House.\nHowever, when it comes to ESSA in general, Robinson said he believes that Trump views the law as a result of a \"bipartisan coalition\" and that the president-elect won't get too heavily involved in ESSA's rollout.\nAnd Robinson expects states to have a great deal of flexibility in the ESSA accountability plans that they submit to the Trump administration starting next year—significantly more than they enjoyed under Obama-era waivers from the No Child Left Behind Act, the predecessor to ESSA.\n\"This is a great time to be a state chief,\" Robinson said, adding at the same time that \"I don't want state chiefs to think that when they turn those [plans] in that,'Oh, well, these will just get approved.' \"\nWhat's more, a lot of policies under the No Child Left Behind Act were part of the law but the George W. Bush or Obama administration didn't do much to enforce them. A couple of examples: the requirement that highly qualified teachers be distributed fairly between poor and less-poor schools, and that districts offer free tutoring to students in schools that weren't making progress under the law.\nThere could be similar examples of provisions that are on the books in ESSA, or in the Obama administration's regulations for the law, said Vic Klatt, a one-time aide to House Republicans who is now a principal at the Penn Hill Group. And since the Trump administration will be the first to enforce ESSA, it could be \"easier and less disruptive\" for it to simply ignore parts of the law than it would be for another administration down the line, Klatt said.\nTrump could also discard another key piece of the Obama education legacy: The president-elect could significantly curb the role of the department's office for civil rights when it comes to state and local policies, according to Robinson, and thereby return the OCR's role more to how it operated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. That could have a big impact on everything from action on racial disparities in school discipline to transgender students' rights.\nRobinson also said that he expects the OCR to ensure that students' rights are not \"trampled on.\"\nSome civil rights advocates though, are already concerned, given some of Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric on Muslims and Latinos, that the office won't flex its enforcement muscles.\n\"We're worried,\" said Liz King, the director of education policy for the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"We're hearing what everyone else is hearing from teachers and families that kids don't feel safe.\"\nMuch depends on whom Trump picks to lead his Education Department—assuming that he decides not to seek elimination or drastic cutbacks to the agency, which he has sometimes said he would like to do.\nIn October, Carl Palladino, a school board member in Buffalo, N.Y., and a Trump campaign surrogate, said he believed that if elected, Trump would pick someone from outside the education policy world to lead the department.\nAnother critical decision will be on who reviews states' proposed accountability plans for ESSA next year.\n\"Who are going to be his people? If he brings in a traditional right-of-center group, you can take it from there,\" said Maria Ferguson, the executive director of the Center on Education Policy, who worked in the Education Department under President Bill Clinton.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks at his victory rally on Nov. 9 in New York City. The Republican real estate developer made school choice a key theme when talking about public education on the campaign trail.\nFerguson suggested a traditional conservative policy agenda of expanded charter schools and other initiatives would probably get traction under Trump.\n\"All these familiar themes that the right-of-center groups have talked about will become a version of his agenda,\" Ferguson predicted. She mentioned school choice and groups like the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination. \"But I don't think it's going to come from him.\"\nEarlier this year, Trump tapped Rob Goad, a staffer for Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., to be his education adviser, not long before the Trump campaign released its $20 billion school choice plan. There are some basic similarities between Trump's plan and a push last year to make federal Title I aid \"portable\" for disadvantaged students to use at both public and private schools.\nAnd Trump's transition team for education includes Robinson, the former Florida and Virginia state chief, and Williamson M. Evers, a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, who worked at the Education Department under President George W. Bush.\nMuch also depends on Trump's relationship with Congress and to what extent he empowers key GOP lawmakers on education policy.\nBesides ESSA, Congress has been fairly active in moving education-related legislation. In recent months, for example, the House of Representatives approved reauthorizations of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.\nSome, but less, progress has also been made on renewing the Child Nutrition Act. And the Higher Education Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Head Start federal preschool program are up for reauthorization in the near future.\nTrump has outlined a general plan on college affordability, including capping student-loan repayments at 12.5 percent of income and instituting loan forgiveness after 15 years for certain borrowers. College affordability is a more prominent issue thanks to the 2016 presidential campaign. And since Congress remains sharply divided along partisan lines, Trump and the Republicans likely won't be able to simply roll ahead with all their preferences on higher education.\n\"You're not doing anything legislatively without bipartisan support,\" said West, of Harvard. \"It's not obvious to me that there is a clear Republican agenda in Congress right now with respect to K-12 education, except for trying to ensure that ESSA is implemented in a way consistent with the intent of the law of empowering states to design accountability systems as they see fit.\"\nBut uncertainty prevails, both over what the new president will take an interest in and how much he will push to get education bills and initiatives over the finish line."

The Scarlet and Gray extended the early lead, continued to build upon it and never allowed the Rebels to even feign a threat as Ohio State dominated, winning 54-21 Saturday afternoon at Ohio Stadium.\nRedshirt senior quarterback J.T. Barrett marched his team down the field at will against an overmatched, less-talented UNLV defense, completing 12-of-17 passes for 209 yards and five touchdowns and subbed out before halftime.\nSeven players — wideouts Terry McLaurin, Johnnie Dixon, K.J. Hill, Binjimen Victor, Campbell and walk-on C.J. Saunders and tight end Rashod Berry — caught touchdowns for the Buckeyes, the most in a single game in Ohio State history.\nBarrett overthrew sophomore wideout K.J Hill on one of his first passes of the game, but settled in as the Buckeyes scored on all but one of his drives. Campbell led Ohio State with three catches for 105 yards, but fumbled near the goal line on his team’s third drive of the game.\nThe Rebels offense stood no chance facing off against the Buckeyes’ stout defense. An aggressive, blitz-heavy defensive front pressured redshirt freshman quarterback Armani Rogers the entire game. Late in the first quarter, backed up at the 2-yard line, defensive tackle Dre’Mont Jones stuffed a run and forced Ohio State’s first safety of the season.\nThe Buckeyes racked up four sacks and a season-high 13 tackles for loss. Sophomore defensive end Nick Bosa led the Buckeyes with three tackles behind the line of scrimmage.\nRogers competed 11-of-19 passes for 88 yards. The Rebels, buoyed by junior running back Lexington Thomas’ 55-yard touchdown, rushed for 41 yards on 176 carries.\nWith 3:32 left in the second quarter while leading 37-7, redshirt freshman quarterback Dwayne Haskins replaced Barrett, and first-team All-American center Billy Price subbed out of the blowout.\nHaskins threaded the needle to Saunders for his first touchdown of the game, a 28-yard strike across the middle. The strong-armed quarterback went 15-for-23 and 228 yards and tossed two touchdowns. He hit Berry late in the third quarter who rumbled for a 38-yard touchdown, the first of the defensive end-turned-tight end’s career.\nHaskins later threw an interception to linebacker/defensive back Javin White, who took it 65 yards for a touchdown, the first pick-six thrown by an Ohio State quarterback this year.\nFreshman running back J.K. Dobbins took 14 carries 95 yards. Once again, redshirt sophomore running back Mike Weber did not play. He has dealt with a hamstring injury since the beginning of fall camp and missed the first game of the season.\nDefensive tackle Robert Landers, offensive guard Matt Burrell, linebacker Chris Worley and cornerback Shaun Wade also did not play for Ohio State due to injuries.\nOhio State will look for its third consecutive victory when the Buckeyes head to Piscataway, New Jersey, next Saturday to take on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights (1-2) at 7:30 p.m.\nRewarded with another drop in the polls. Nothing will change until they beat a good team. Penn State will be a challenge. They had a great comeback against Iowa."

        "text": "DENMARK - UK – ASIA - EUROPE – In a bold move designed to out manoeuvre their rivals Maersk, the largest container shipping line in the world, today announced what they consider to be the first major step forward in box transportation for well over a decade. ‘Daily Maersk’ will offer guaranteed delivery times from four Asian ports to three major European hubs for any FCL freight deliveries every day of the week.\nSpeaking at the London launch Eivind Kolding, CEO Maersk Line said that from the company's inception in 1928 very little changed from the monthly schedules offered until in the late 1940’s when twice monthly services appeared. Even with the introduction of containerisation weekly schedules failed to appear until the 1990’s since when little if anything had changed. He said it was Maersk’s intention to offer shippers a ‘conveyor belt’ service with Maersk becoming a natural extension of a supplier’s production line.\nThe service schedules were arrived at after Maersk embarked on a protracted dialogue with their major customers and indeed the product is principally aimed at the heavy hitters, the regular clients with extensive contract commitments to shipping large quantities, which is not to say that spot purchase clients will not necessarily benefit from the reduced delivery times Maersk feel are attainable.\nThe discussion with stakeholders produced three clear requirements including reliability, all shippers were keen to know exactly when their goods would arrive at the destination port as currently around 50% of TEU’s fail to meet the original estimated times of arrival. Complicated systems were another bugbear, consignors wanted a one stop, one touch system rather than the nineteen or so inputs required to send a box on its way which currently exists. The third request was to ensure that wherever possible the customer could claim to maintain their green credentials by utilising a system that was as clean as could reasonably be expected.\n‘Daily Maersk’ is the product of these discussions and Maersk are so confident of its success they are to pay compensation for every container that fails to meet the deadline they have underwritten. The company will pay customers who sign up to the system compensation of $100 for a delay between one and three days. Should the freight arrive 4 days late they will hand over $300. Needless to say Maersk have written in get out clauses for bad weather, port strikes etc.\nOf course there is a downside, at present up to 50% of booked boxes fail to arrive at the port in time to meet the cut off times, or indeed at all, and to the container companies this simply means lost revenue. Containers booked under the new system which fail to arrive will be subject to a penalty which presumably will be negotiated with individual shippers (those which deign to agree to it). Maersk see this system as a way to directly influence the current overbooking problem.\nThe new schedules, from Ningbo, Shanghai, Yantian and Tanjung Pelepas to Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam, will occupy 70 vessels of the company’s fleet, around 25% of Maersk Line’s TEU carrying capacity. Despite the mention of the intent to make the service as green as possible it simply may not be feasible with traffic levels as they are. Only by running the newer, larger yet more efficient vessels closer to their full capacity can reduced emissions of CO2 per tonne be achieved. To ensure vessels make their guaranteed time targets it may even be sometimes necessary to abandon the current slow steaming policy, designed to conserve expensive fuel and reduce pollution levels, simply to stick to schedules.\n“This is the first time compensation will be paid by a shipping company and this is to underscore our confidence in this product. We have been in discussion with a number of customers, including Sony, and they have expressed approval. ‘Daily Maersk’ responds to some key concerns by ensuring on time delivery in Northern Europe. How can we do this? By upping capacity and spreading port calls and having a back up plan for every vessel. All the customer needs is total transport. We see larger customers with sophisticated management systems taking advantage of this and reducing their warehousing needs.\nNo partnerships with other lines will be involved in the provision of this service and, before anyone believes this will be rolled out globally, even Maersk admit that the daily cut off system is currently only feasible on the busy Asia to Europe run. Cynics will note that Maersk are due to collect a lot more of the bigger container vessels they have on order within the next year or two and they need cargo to fill them but there is no doubt that other box carriers will feel a chill down their spines at what is a very inventive and bold move to completely dominate the Asian European freight trade.\nThe first daily cut off will be on the 24th October, the guaranteed transportation times to the three European ports (Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam) are as follows. Ex Ningbo – 36 days, ex Shanghai – 34 days, ex Yantian – 30 days and for Tanjung Pelepas – 26 days. Transportation time is defined as from the cut off date issued for the departure port and the availability of the cargo at the port of destination. If cargo arrives early there will be no demurrage charges until the agreed cargo availability date has passed.\nAround seven million forty foot equivalent units pass from Asia to Northern Europe annually and Maersk currently shift over one million of them. With this set of schedules it is obvious that the Danish giants intend to take up as much of the market as possible by concentrating more than ever on the companies responsible for the bulk of this traffic. The end result remains to be seen but as this scheme takes shape at least two of Maersk’s main rivals will be looked at very closely by industry analysts should it result in an upswing of tonnage for ‘Daily Maersk’.\nPhoto:- The giant Emma Maersk in port."

Kennedy, Sr., sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and widow of the heir to the Devonshire dukedom, died in a plane crash en route to secure her father's blessings on her second marriage. She was born on February 20, 1920, and was only 28 at the time of her death.\nWhen President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed JFK's father Joseph Kennedy ambassador to the Court of St. James, his daughter Kathleen spent a year and a half living in London. She was educated in London at Queen's College.\nBeautiful and spirited, she was named the \"most exciting debutante of 1938.\" In 1943 she returned to England to work in a center for servicemen set up by the Red Cross.\nDespite the opposition of her intensely Catholic mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy, known to friends as \"Kick\", married William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, a Protestant and the eldest son and heir of the 10th Duke of Devonshire on May 6, 1944.\nOther than her eldest brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. who died in a plane crash three months after the wedding, no one from the Kennedy family attended the marriage ceremony. Her husband was killed in action only four months later in World War II, and his younger brother Andrew Cavendish, married to Deborah Mitford, became the heir to the dukedom. See the newspaper report of her death on right.\nPopular on the London social circuit and admired by many for her high spirits - though more traditional members of British society found fault with her boisterousness - the dashing young widow eventually became the mistress of Peter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 8th Earl FitzWilliam. The couple planned to wed after Fitzwilliam's planned divorce. Instead, while on a trip to visit Joseph Kennedy Sr. and gain his blessing for their relationship, Lord Fitzwilliam and Lady Hartington died in an airplane crash in Saint-Bauzile, Ardèche, France.\nOnly her father represented the Kennedy family at her funeral. Her mother, Rose, declined to attend supposedly because of Kathleen's intention to marry outside the Catholic Church a second time.\nIt is also said that Rose Kennedy also discouraged Kathleen's siblings from attending for the same reason. Rose apparently forgave Kathleen not long thereafter, and in 1951, she was reportedly delighted that her first grandchild, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy, was named after her late daughter. However, the family requested that the child not be nicknamed Kick.\nThe Marchioness of Hartington is buried in the Cavendish family plot at Saint Peter's Church, Edensor, near Chatsworth in Derbyshire, England. Among the wreaths that covered her coffin was one with a handwritten note from Sir Winston Churchill. The gymnasium at Manhattanville College is named in her honor.\nOn this day in 2005 the U.S. Department of Defense changed its mind about base closings, and that was the end of Otis NG as an air base.\nThe largest New England facilities saved by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) were the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in Maine, and the Naval Submarine Base New London, in Connecticut -- each with thousands of jobs. Then, on its last day of deliberations, the BRAC unexpectedly reversed the Defense Department's proposed expansion of Hanscom Air Force Base, outside Boston, and voted to close Otis Air National Guard Base, on Cape Cod, with plans to send its fighter jets to Barnes Air National Guard Base, in Greater Springfield.\nOtis was later removed from the list on August 26, 2005, although the jets were still transferred to Barnes."

(WLFI) — Wildlife rehibilators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where 57 others were dumped in December.\n\"It's a crazy situation,\" said Kim Hoover with Hoots to Howls Wildlife Rehabilitation.\nHoover was notified of the dumping on Feb. 28. An attendant at the White County rest stop on northbound I-65 called her. Hoover said nine boxes, identical to those found in December, were filled with pigeons in a dumpster. Four of the 88 pigeons were found dead, Hoover said.\nThe discovery now makes 145 pigeons found dumped in the same dumpster. Indiana State Police recovered 57 pigeons on Dec. 10. Hoover never thought she would see another situation like this again.\n\"I thought it was a rare act, never happen again, once in a lifetime as heart wrenching as it was then it happens two months later and you're like really?\" she said.\nUnlike the December discovery where the birds were buried in the dumpster, this flock was found on top of trash. Hoover said likely, they were dumped overnight between Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.\n\"They're gorgeous birds,\" said Hoover. \"These are some of the prettiest pigeons I've ever seen. It just stinks.\"\nShe said pigeon enthusiasts reached out to her and helped fill in some of the blanks. The pigeons found in the dumpster are Parlor Roller pigeons. They are bred for their ability to somersault on the ground. People roll them on the ground in competitions to see how far they can go. Click here and go to the 3:03 minute mark to see these rolling birds in action.\nThere are pigeon clubs who compete with these birds humanely, but Hoover believes these dumpster pigeons were part of an illegal gambling ring and were abused. She said both times she came to resuce the birds, they had parasites on them and the boxes they were in did not have breathing holes.\n\"There's a lot of money being made and I am told that this fellow could care less about fines because he knows they won't get in trouble,\" she said.\nHoover said the birds found recently had the same tags on them as the ones found in December. The tags had the name and phone number of a Dublin, Ohio man. News 18 attempted to make calls to the number provided and it has been disconnected. The fact that the man is located out of state is causing problems for who is responsible to help.\n\"The animal control of Dublin Ohio which is where they come from say they were dumped in Indiana and Indiana is like well they came from Ohio,\" said Hoover.\nHoover said she is worried that this has happened at this rest stop other times but unfortunately, those birds were not found in time. She suggested the rest stop get security cameras, but found out that the state won't fund it.\nWildlife centers in Valparaiso and Illinois took a majority of the birds from Hoover. She has 11 left in her care. She said she has received offers of help from other people as well, which she is thankful for. So what's next for the birds?\n\"They have got to get their health up and hopefully then adopted out,\" she said. \"They are trying to find people who understand the birds and you don't want them to go back into the same situation they came from.\""

Nathan Sutherland was arrested and charged with sexual assault.\nHacienda HealthCare announced Thursday that it is closing its 60-bed intermediate care facility, where a patient was raped and recently gave birth.\nThe non-profit company said the board of directors, \"after a great deal of consideration, has come to understand that it is simply not sustainable to continue to operate\" the facility, which is at 1402 E. South Mountain Drive.\nGov. Doug Ducey was quick to criticize the decision, calling the announcement, \"concerning\" because state agencies have been actively working to increase oversight at the facility to ensure patient safety.\n\"For some patients at the facility, this is the only home they know or remember,\" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said. \"Forcing this medically fragile community to move should be a last resort. Everyone's first priority should be protecting their health and safety.\"\nOfficials with the Arizona Department of Economic Security were similarly upset by the announcement, calling it \"very disturbing news\" and imploring Hacienda HealthCare to work with the state moving forward.\n\"We want to find a path forward that is in the best interests of the patients — and this approach is not it,\" an emailed statement from spokeswoman Tasya Peterson says.\n\"State agencies are exhausting all efforts to bring this to a conclusion that is beneficial to the patients, some of whom have been at this facility nearly their entire lives,\" she said. \"They are the ones who should come first, without question. This approach simply does not meet that test.\"\nHacienda HealthCare says the board voted on the closure last Friday, which is also when the third party manager the company had brought on board as ordered by the state left Hacienda for good.\nIndiana-based Benchmark Human Services was on site at Hacienda last week but company officials said that at the end of last week they, \"reluctantly stopped this very important effort.\"\nDucey's office said it was aware of the board's vote because Hacienda met with state agencies on Monday morning. Though the board's vote was acknowledged, Hacienda did not provide a notice to terminate, nor did it provide a transition plan, Ptak said.\n\"In fact, through today discussions continued around developing an ongoing plan to ensure the care of patients at the facility,\" he wrote in a message Thursday evening.\nHacienda HealthCare officials on Thursday said they will begin to transition clients and eventually will cease to operate the facility.\nIn its most recent federal survey, Hacienda's intermediate care facility had 39 patients ranging in age from 16 to 68. Most were described as \"non-ambulatory.\" Hacienda officials on Thursday say their patient count is now at 37.\n\"Given what happened recently it's not surprising and I don't think it's going to break too many people's hearts that a facility that did such a poor job of taking care of vulnerable adults is no longer in business,\" said Jon Meyers, executive director of The Arc of Arizona, a non-profit advocacy organization that represents Arizonans with intellectual disabilities.\nBut the problem is that families have no other private alternative in Arizona, which is yet another disservice to the individuals with intellectual disabilities who rely on them for care, Meyers added.\nAll the other intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities are operated by the state, and most don't have the capacity to handle individuals who live at Hacienda, he said.\nThe patient who gave birth is a 29-year-old non-verbal, incapacitated member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe described in court records as needing a, \"maximum level of care.\"\nOne of the woman's Hacienda HealthCare providers, licensed practical nurse Nathan Sutherland, was arrested on Jan. 23 and charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of vulnerable-adult abuse.\nHe surrendered his state-licensed practical nurse license on Jan. 24.\nHacienda HealthCare also operates a 74-bed skilled nursing facility for infants, children, teens and young adults on the 1402 E. South Mountain Ave. campus.\nWhen the patient gave birth on Dec. 29, an employee who called 911 indicated that the staff did not know the woman was pregnant.\nAn option for further testing for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, syphilis and HIV.\nOn Jan. 16, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System and the Arizona Department of Economic Security sent a letter directing Hacienda HealthCare to have a third-party manager in place to operate its skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities by Jan. 30.\nThe company agreed, but when the deal fell through, the state told Hacienda they needed to submit a plan by the end of this week.\nTwo state lawmakers have introduced legislation this session that would require all intermediate care facilities to be licensed by the state, in addition to being certified by the federal government. Facilities like Hacienda have been exempt from state licensing since 1997.\nMany of those patients are non-ambulatory, have seizure disorders, behavior problems, mental illness, visual or hearing impairments, or a combination, and all must qualify financially for Medicaid assistance."

Mitch McConnell can rectify this immediately,\" Stewart said, noting that the Kentucky pol sponsored a health care bill for nuclear energy workers that has cost $11 billion.\n\"How in good conscience can you deny them the very thing that you have proudly brought to the people of your state? Please, personally ask him that,\" Stewart said.\nMcConnell ignored questions about his role in blocking the legislation after a press conference Tuesday. His spokesman denied he was the roadblock.\nSept. 11 advocate John Feal said the group met with McConnell Wednesday and he promised to include Zadroga in an omnibus budget bill, but said money must still be found to pay for it.\nCongress let the World Trade Center Health Program expire in September. The program has enough money to continue treatment for responders suffering from cancer and respiratory disease caused by Ground Zero toxins for now, but it will run out if the feds don't renew it.\nBackers want a permanent reauthorization.\n\"Men and women who answered the call of duty after the gravest terrorist attack in our nation's history stood there on the pile looking for survivors, finding remains, doing the horrible work of cleaning up after such a loss — all the while breathing in so many deadly toxins that are now killing them,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).\n\"They came because they are patriots. They came before they are heroes. So what is Congress doing today? Nothing. The answer is nothing.\"\nStill, she vowed to get the bill over the finish line before Congress leaves town for the holidays.\n\"We are moving this bill,\" she said. \"What we need from our Senate and House leadership is exactly that — leadership.\""

The 14-day combined training exercise expanded operational and cultural knowledge between U.S. and Indian Soldiers and increased knowledge of peacekeeping operations.\n\"This two-week exercise brought these Soldiers together for this increasingly complex exercise. What we've done here through Yudh Abhyas is important. It's important to this relationship between our two countries,\" said Brig. Gen. Raymond Palumbo, commanding general of U.S. Army Alaska.\nApproximately 750 Soldiers from the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (National Guard) and Indian Army soldiers from the 62nd Infantry and 5th parachute Regiment Brigade participated in Yudh Abhyas 2010 and filled the formation during the ceremony.\n\"I thought the outcome of this exercise was great. As far as our training objectives, we met all of them,\" said Maj. Edward Berg, brigade judge advocate, 4th ABCT, 25th ID. \"The thing that will last for me, that I will remember most, is just the time getting to know my counterpart and creating that friendship.\"\nThe ceremony marked the end of many other events centralized on joint cohesion on and off the field of training.\n\"We had a great time getting to know each other on a personal level as well as a professional level,\" Berg added. \"I think it's important not only personally to make friends with people from different nations, but also professionally as we go more towards joint operating environments.\"\nYudh Abhyas 2010 included a command post exercise that focused on combined peacekeeping operations, a field training exercise that included several combined missions, marksmanship and tactical training highlighted by a Javelin live-fire, a combined U.S. and India airborne jump, as well as various cultural activities and social exchanges.\nThe exercise was significant within all levels involved, Palumbo said. It strengthened national bonds between India and the United States, it brought two allied militaries together on the same field, and gave each individual participant a chance to experience an unfamiliar culture and establish new friendships.\n\"It's great that we brought two professional armies together for something like this. I think we've created great friendships for the future,\" Berg said.\nSoldiers and leaders from both armies presented gifts to commemorate the bonds established through the training event, and bid farewell to each other to conclude the ceremony and Yudh Abhyas 2010.\nYudh Abhyas is a regularly-scheduled bilateral, conventional-forces training exercise, sponsored by U.S. Army, Pacific and the Indian army. The exercise is designed to promote cooperation between the two militaries to develop U.S. Army Pacific and USARAK relationships with India and promote interoperability through combined military decision making process, battle tracking and maneuvering forces, and exchange of tactics, techniques and procedures."

The person who does that is not photographed.\nHouseholds that participate will be rated on how efficiently they recycle.\n\"Normally when you throw something away and the lid goes down you forget about it -- out of sight out of mind -- and that&apos;s the end of it,\" said Anja Thieme, one of the postgraduate students in charge of the project. \"But the reality could not be further from the truth.

        "text": "Just a couple of questions in regard to a planned upgrade. Currently I have a POS GF2MX400 and am in search of a card for about 100-150 Aussie Dollars. I've done a bit of research and have found a few cards drawn to my attention the likes being Radeon 9550, Radeon 9550 Extreme and a few from the 9600 series. I'm steering clear of nVidia for that end of the market as they seem to get blasted by ATI.\nMy current frame of mind is: Get the 9550 for <$100 as it will be 100% better than my current card and have no regrets, spend the rest of the money on something else.\nBut looking at some reviews the 9550 Extreme seems to be pretty sweet aswell. it has a clockspeed of 400/500 up from the 9550 clock speed of 250/400. It has got a few FPS on the stock 9600 in some benches.\nBut it costs an extra $50. Are the internals the same on these cards, would I be able to get the same figures from a stock 9550 with an aftermarket cooler?\nHaven't read much about the 9550, but looking at the specs on the card, it's clearly worse than a 9600, but doesn't cost much less. I can't say anything about the 9550 Extreme, though. In any case, they all support Direct X 9.0 adn have similar speeds, so I don't think you'll be too dissapointed with whatever you choose.\nOn the other hand, it would be worth it to get some more money for something from the Radeon 9700/9800 series. The 9800 Pro is probably the best bang-for-buck card in there, but any of them will be much better than a 9600 or 9550 because they are all 256-bit. The 9600 is basically the top of the low-end range of cards, so \"upgrading\" to one isn't really much of an upgrade.\nMost of those R9550's that are less than $100aus will likely only have 64-bit memory access so stay clear of them and get one that has a full 128-bit memory access.\nSorry but I can't really help you on that subject.\nYawgm0th believe my I would absolutely love to go out and buy a 9800 Pro but I simply can't/won't. I don't have the cash, and even If I did I'd prefer to spend it elsewhere.\nOne more question, how well do nonpro 9600 overclock?\nIf I remember correctly, my Sapphire 9600 non-pro got somewhere around 400/560 in an OEM desktop with no case fans.... But again, I might not remember that right.\nBut I wouldn't get too worked up over it. All the overclocking in the world isn't going to make a 9600 play any modern game well. It's okay if you're still into some of the older Quake-3 based games, I guess.\nIt appears to be the same as this, which is 128-bit."

This means sticking to foods that were available to your Paleolithic ancestors during a prehistoric era that ended about 15,000 years ago. While Loren Cordain, author of \"The Paleo Diet,\" is perhaps one of the most well-known proponents of this way of eating, you can find slightly different types of paleo diets.\nLoren Cordain recommends avoiding dairy, eggs, grains and legumes and focusing on lean meat, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts and seeds. Cordain claims the paleo people ate a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, so his approach places emphasis on lean meats above all. On the other hand, Arthur De Vany, author of \"The New Evolution Diet,\" claims that your paleo ancestors mainly foraged for plants and hunted meat when they could. His paleo-style diet places emphasis on vegetables and fruit, not meat. He does not exclude starchy vegetables, and he recommends eating at least 25 percent of your vegetables raw.\nIf you cringe at the thought of avoiding dairy and eggs, perhaps Mark Sisson, author of \"The Primal Blueprint,\" has the diet for you. Although he claims your paleo ancestors thrived on a plant-based diet, he doesn't exclude dairy and eggs. Sisson recommends choosing raw, grass-fed or fermented dairy products, but he recommends having fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of your diet. In addition, Sisson recommends wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat. He, too, recommends avoiding grains, legumes, processed oils and table sugar.\nRobb Wolf, author of \"The Paleo Solution,\" has similar recommendations to Loren Cordain. However, he takes a slightly different approach when it comes to meat. Wolf doesn't seem to think animal fat is a major problem and recommends meat such as pork chops, bacon and fatty cuts of steak that you'd normally avoid on other paleo-style diets. Wolf emphasizes grass-fed meat and wild game meat, which he says is naturally leaner than commercial meat. Wolf also recommends starchy vegetables, which Cordain places on the no-no list.\nThere's no one way to apply paleo principles to your eating habits. However, all approaches seem to agree that it's better to eat as naturally as possible and avoid junk food, processed food and table sugar. Researchers are finding that paleo diets may offer potential benefits. A small randomized study found that adhering to a paleo diet for three months improved blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors in participants with Type 2 diabetes. The results were published in the journal \"Cardiovascular Diabetology\" in July 2009.\nFroek, Barbara. \"Alternatives to Cordain's Paleo Diet.\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/alternatives-cordains-paleo-diet-11384.html.

If the test is confirmed, this would be the first known case of Ebola being contracted or transmitted in the United States.\nThe level of the virus in the woman’s system was “low,” Frieden said, adding that another test to confirm whether she has the virus will be conducted later Sunday.\nFrieden said at least 48 people who came in contact with Duncan before he was admitted to the hospital in Dallas are at risk of contracting the virus.\n“Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola,” Frieden said.\n“The risk is in the 48 people who are being monitored, all of whom have been tested daily, none of whom so far have developed symptoms or fever,” Frieden said.\nAn “intensive investigation” is also being conducted to determine others who may have come in contact with Duncan while he was being treated, because they may have been exposed as well, Frieden added. Some of these workers could have had a breach in contamination control similar to the one that led to the nurse being infected, he said.\nWhen the nurse became feverish on Friday, she reported it and was given a preliminary test for the virus, which turned up positive Saturday night, Frieden said.\nThe CDC and Texas health officials are investigating how many people the nurse came in contact with after coming down with symptoms of the disease.\nFrieden said the CDC has sent additional staff to Dallas to assist with the response. The agency will also enhance training of health care workers who may have to treat patients with the virus.\nThe key to stopping the spread of the disease is to “break the chains of transmission,” he said. This involves promptly diagnosing anyone who has symptoms of the disease, isolating that individual, identifying everyone this person came in contact with and actively monitor those people over a 21-day period. If any of these contacts comes down with Ebola symptoms, then the same process starts over again.\nDavid Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, who also participated in the news briefing, agreed.\n“I firmly believe we will stop it,” Lakey said."

Video and other information on an opponent began flowing.\nBut the Wildcats will prepare differently this time. On top of adjusting to the approach of a new coaching staff, they will have to spend the next two days planning for multiple opponents before locking in on either La Salle or Boise State on Thursday in Kansas City.\nScouting for two teams instead of one will be a challenge. Coaches will come up with two game plans, and the staff will provide players with twice as much video. To help ease the process, Bruce Weber said four coaches will help gather information instead of the usual three.\nSome will argue preparing for multiple opponents puts K-State at a disadvantage compared to other highly seeded teams. Three other teams in the field of 68 have to deal with the same time crunch and challenge of facing a team that has already won a game in the tournament.\nBoise State averages more than 73 points behind Anthony Drmic (17.3 points) and Derrick Marks (16.3).

It’s a return trip to Kansas after Gonzaga’s victory in a neutral-court game in Seattle this season.\nK-State season-ticket holders and Ahearn Fund members will have first opportunities to purchase tickets, with a public sale beginning at 10 a.m. Sept. 13 through selectaseat.com or by calling 855-755-7328.

        "text": "APATZINGAN, Mexico — Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to enforce its orders that no businesses should open.\nThe fire attack came just two blocks from the Apatzingan city center where, the day before, dozens of federal police had paraded in an impressive display of force meant to re-impose order in a region where heavily armed vigilantes have taken up a freelance fight against the drug gang.\nAn employee of the pharmacy said two men pulled up with jerry cans of gasoline and began dousing the store and its merchandise. “They just told us to get out, because they were going to burn the place,” she said.\nThe employee, part of whose hair was burned off in the attack, refused to give her name for fear of reprisals.\nOwners of other stores have said that cartel gunmen have ordered them to close or risk being burned down. Another pharmacy employee, who gave her name only as Norma, said the increased federal security that arrived this week appeared to have done little to discourage the Knights Templar cartel, which has subjected local residents to systematic extortion for years.\nBut federal forces have other challenges, as well. The local police in Apatzingan were considered so untrustworthy that the entire 300-man force was relieved of duty and sent out of town for background checks.\nOfficials from the federal and Michoacan state governments met until late Tuesday with leaders of “self-defense” groups.\nWhile refusing to give up their weapons, vigilante leaders appeared to be seeking a cooling of tensions.\n“We have to be discreet with our weapons and not move up and down the highways with them,” said Hipolito Mora, a lime grower who leads the self-defense group in the town of La Ruana, after the meeting.\nInterior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong confirmed the talks had taken place, and said the government was offering jobs as police to qualified members of the self-defense forces.\nThe spokesman for the vigilante movement, Estanislao Beltran, previously said the vigilantes weren’t interested in such offers. “We don’t want jobs as policemen. We’re fighting for the freedom of our families,” he said.\nThe talks came after soldiers clashed with townspeople in Antunez, where at least two men were reportedly killed during the confrontation that began late Monday. Video of the clash aired by Milenio Television showed a chaotic scene in which angry townspeople scuffled with soldiers and apparently tried to grab the gun and equipment of at least one soldier.\nThe unrest is in a region of Michoacan known as Tierra Caliente, a farming area rich in limes, avocados and mangos where vigilante groups have been trying to drive out the Knights Templar drug cartel. After a weekend of firefights, the government announced Monday that it would take on security duties in the area.\nThroughout Tuesday, federal police officers and soldiers set up roadside checkpoints just yards from roadblocks manned by vigilantes on routes into towns controlled by self-defense groups, but there were no attempts to take weapons from the civilians.\nOne federal officer who was not authorized to speak to the press said they had no orders to disarm anyone, or to try to take towns held by vigilantes, who have surrounded Apatzingan, which is said to be a Knights Templar stronghold.\nHundreds of federal police officers poured into Apatzingan, the region’s main city, in pickup trucks mounted with machines guns, armored vehicles and buses. They massed in the city’s main square.\nCritics have suggested that some self-defense groups have been infiltrated by the rival New Generation cartel, which the vigilantes vehemently deny.\nAfter initially arresting vigilantes months ago, the federal government has appeared to be working with them recently. The army and federal police have provided helicopter cover and road patrols while self-defense groups attacked the cartel, but never intervened in the battles.\nSelf-defense group leaders said they were coordinating the highway blockades in the 17 municipalities they control to keep out soldiers and federal police.\nFelipe Diaz, a leader of vigilantes in Coalcoman, said close to 1,000 men, women and children helped block the main highway until soldiers and dozens of federal police in four buses and 15 pickup trucks left the area.\nAssociated Press writers Olga R. Rodriguez, E. Eduardo Castillo and Katherine Corcoran in Mexico City contributed to this report."

        "text": "LAURA'S is just what Oyster Bay needs and its residents know it. They have taken this newly opened American restaurant to their hearts and made it an instant hit. Even midweek evenings find nearly every table filled; on Saturdays there are crowds waiting in the bar.\nPart of the draw is James Paskins, the restaurant's chef and owner, who acquired a following during his years at the Coach Grill, also in Oyster Bay. His wife and other family members efficiently handle the front of the house. Another crowd pleaser is the reasonable prices. Entrees start at $11 and top out at $18.\nLaura's, named for Mr. Paskins's late mother, looks much as it did last year, when 68 West Main was at this location. It is spacious and comfortable. The dining room is defined by white columns, carved molding, smoky mirrors and crystal chandeliers. In a town filled with casual cafes, Laura's smart good looks make it stand out.\nOne new feature is the entrance through the bar. This, no doubt, eliminates drafts in the dining room but the crowded, smoky bar does not make a positive first impression. The dining room, however, is a place of charm and serenity.\nOther salad sensations are a just-right Caesar and a plate of grilled vegetables served atop baby greens with a balsamic vinaigrette as a dipping sauce. The seafood salad carries a price tag ($12) that is higher than some entrees, but this abundant assembly could be a main course. It stars jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, calamari, scungilli, chopped peppers, red onions, celery and black olives in a lemon-basil vinaigrette.\nOther openers I would order again are tender clams oreganata with a refreshingly spare use of bread crumbs, New Zealand mussels in a sherry pink sauce enlivened by spicy, smoky andouille sausage, a huge crab cake made lighter by the inclusion of shredded vegetables and two big portobellos served on a bed of grilled tomatoes and baby spinach. One creation that does not work, though, is the smoked-salmon-crusted-oysters. The delicate bivalves never had a chance. The assertive bready topping was too much for them. Every day a different homemade ravioli ($13) is featured. On my visit, they were filled with sun-dried tomatoes and black olives and tossed with big chunks of succulent chicken, chopped tomatoes, broccoli and an abundance of garlic. A winner! Another tasty pasta pick was fettuccine hidden under a mountain of sliced shell steak, three types of mushrooms and a chunky tomato sauce.\nFish were all cooked with precision. The herb-crusted tuna was rare as ordered and a special of striped bass in a tomato-basil sauce was moist and flaky as was sauteed tilapia in a mushroom-lemon-wine sauce.\nGood meat selections include chicken medallions in a brown sauce spiked with bourbon and touched with cream, a juicy grilled rib eye, a tasty shell steak marinated in teriyaki sauce and a memorable rack of lamb special, served pink as ordered, atop a bed of barely wilted baby spinach. That spinach aside, the same vegetables show up with every entree. But, it should be said, the creamy mashed potatoes are terrific.\nDesserts are not homemade but high-quality bakery fare. The ganache-like chocolate mousse cake and the creamy New York-style cheesecake are the most noteworthy.\nPrices here are gentle, with 15 of 21 table wines in the $14 to $20 range. A glass of flinty Fetzer Sundial chardonnay costs $5 and a bottle of 1995 Tessera zinfandel, displaying a velvety texture and accessible fruit flavors, is $20.\n68 West Main Street, Oyster Bay, 624-7100.\nRecommended dishes Clams oreganata, crab cake, portobello mushrooms, mussels, all salads, bourbon chicken, rib eye, marinated shell steak, rack of lamb, ravioli, shell steak fettuccine, tuna, tilapia, striped bass, chocolate mousse cake, cheesecake.\nPrice range Lunch, entrees $5 to $11. At dinner, appetizers $4 to $12; entrees $11 to $18.\nHours Lunch, 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday; Sunday brunch 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M.; Dinner 5 to 10 P.M.

        "text": "SPOILER ALERT: Before you read this post, roast yourself a nice pig, pour yourself a bottle of wine (I suggest a fruity grenache with the pork), cork the bottle extremely tightly and watch last night’s Lost.\nWe can spend all day talking about the mythology and background revealed on “Ab Aeterno,” an intense episode of Lost–and I’m sure we will–but let’s say this first: fancy story aside, last night showed us a fine hour of acting, plain and simple.\nI’ve seen Nestor Carbonell in a variety of roles on TV (from Bat Manuel in The Tick to the CBS soap Cane), and it’s not like he’s been a slouch as Richard on Lost. But until this season, he’s had to play Richard on a single, subdued, sustained note of enigmatic cool. In “Ab Aeterno,” he almost literally made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob’s ambassador on the Island.\nIt may have seemed like a lot of time spent to some viewers, but clearly Cuse and Lindelof thought they needed to show, not just tell, the circumstances that brought Richard to his current pass. And Carbonell sold it, embodied Ricardo’s horror as he lived through a Victorian-horror melodrama. Which is important, because they had to place us in the mindset of someone who believes, literally not figuratively, that he is actually in hell.\nSo are they in hell? (That, and Purgatory, were among the first theories fans spun about Lost.) Are they actually in danger, as Ghost Isabella says, of going to hell? No, but Ricardo has come to what he thinks of as hell, and to a place that someone of his era and mindset will naturally interpret as hell. Unlike, say, Hurley, a religious, penitent man living on the Canary Islands in 1867 has not read sci-fi or seen a monster movie in his life. If he ends up in a place where he sees horrors, where the dead come to life (and are seemingly killed again), and a thing made of smoke snatches men up to their death—well, that’s hell, case closed. Someone of another era will give it a different name.\nIt’s not hell–right?–but it is, “Ab Aeterno” told us more explicitly than ever, a metaphysical playing ground, where two forces are battling it out through human subjects, not unlike gods in Greek mythology. So what game are Jacob and Smokey/The Man in Black playing? We got the rough outline at the end of season 5–and fans have inferred or theorized most of the rest–but it was still a bit stunning to hear Jacob say it to Ricardo directly.\nTo wit: Smokey is imprisoned on the Island. He is a malevolent force–call him evil, call him hatred, call him the devil if you want–who, if released, would spread over the world like, well, black smoke. (Or wine. I like the idea of a Wine Monster.) Jacob brings people to the Island, where–whatever they have done in the past–they have a chance to choose good over evil. (He is, metaphorically, the producer of Lost.) Jacob believes people can choose good. Smokey believes (as he said in the season 5 finale) that they always go bad in the end. Smokey tries to manipulate and tempt them toward that end; Jacob believes they must choose of their own free will.\nSo far, so God-and-Devily. But what is “right and wrong” in the endgame of Lost, anyway? I’m glad, if this is the case, that the arc of the series is the characters’ redemption, and that they have agency to choose for themselves. Still, is their goodness going to be defined by which side they pick in this Island-god showdown? Why exactly, is it “good” to pick the jackass deity who strands innocent people in an Island hellhole over the jackass deity who deceives and or kills them once they get there? It’s better, maybe, but I’m not sure Jacob’s role in all this seems so holy. You crashed me on this terrifying rock so you could “prove [Smokey] wrong?” Have a freaking debate society and leave me out of it!\nIn any event, from “Ab Aeterno,” the notion of the Losties finally saying pox-on-both-your-houses and rejecting the whole cosmic game seems less likely. Though I still see signs that Smokey and Jacob may be more alike than they let on: it was certainly interesting to see that, when Smokey tried to enlist Ricardo to kill Jacob, he gave him the knife and the same speech that Dogen (not Jacob, but his servant) gave Sayid to get him to kill Smokey.\nAs all this unfolds, I hope that the other conflicts over the Island built over the last five seasons–the “science-based” story, if you will–aren’t wholly subsumed in the Paradise Lost scenario. How does Hanso, and his descendants in the Hanso foundation, figure into all this? Why did they come to see the Island as significant, and what exactly did Dharma want to achieve on the Island? How did Widmore get there in the first place, and what did he want–and what investment, if any, do Smokey and Jacob have in his war with Ben, and vice versa? The closer I get to the center of the onion, the more I want to revisit the layers.\nThose are all big-picture questions that (I will be a broken record here) are impossible to judge until the season and series are over. As an episode, “Ab Aeterno” again proved Lost’s ability to find the humanity in, and build a connection with, its most seemingly enigmatic characters. Hell of a job.\n* Is it just me, or did Titus Welliver get direction to deliver his lines like Terry O’Quinn—or, specifically, as O’Quinn-as-Smokey-as-Locke? Whether intentional or coincidental, Welliver’s phrasing and manner made clear he and O’Quinn were playing the same character in different bodies. Nice work.\n* So if Smokey gets off The Island, the world will become plagued with evil, hatred and malevolence. As opposed to…?\n* And about Jacob: did he strike anyone else in the 1867 part of this story as more tough and hard-assed than we’ve seen him in the Island’s present? A bit of an Old Testament Jacob?\n* I’ve been reading elsewhere about the parallels between the plot on the Island and Stephen King’s novels, especially The Stand, which at this point I am glad I haven’t read. But when the Man in Black took out the magic weapon and told Ricardo to kill his enemy, was I the only one reminded of HBO’s Carnivàle, and the murderous eternal war among the avatars?\n* When Ricardo saw Isabella in the hold of The Black Rock, the inference was that this was actually Smokey appearing as Isabella to manipulate him. Presumably Smokey had access to Ricardo’s memories after examining and flash-photographing him, yes? I could look this up but I’m not going to: is this the first time we’ve seen Smokey manifest as a person who (unlike Locke, Yemi or Christian) had not physically been on the Island, even as a corpse?\n* That CGI butterfly that fluttered into the Black Rock’s hold–I assume it’s significant, and I have no explanation for it. (My one theory, that the Island is actually Pandora from Avatar, is probably not too likely.) Speaking of CGI, credit to Lost for showing some scenes set on the ocean that did not look like a low-budget video game.\n* OK, this may be immature, but was anyone else wondering if Hurley and Richard were going to share a kiss, a la Ghost, when Ricardo was visited by the shade of Isabella? It would have blown the moment, I suppose, but still.\n* More seriously, when Isabella told Richard he’d suffered enough, were you thinking he was going to die? More to the point, were you, like me, hoping he would die, as a mercy to him? It’s a tribute to the show that it can cause a reaction like this to a character we’ve long known as one of the bad guys–or so, at least, we thought."

        "text": "So now Stephen Harper needs the Indians.\nIt seems everybody does these days — for all the wrong reasons.\nAccording to sources who have seen Harper consultant Doug Eyford’s confidential report, Stephen Harper’s bureaucrats have not done him any favours in moving the Northern Gateway file forward. Eyford told the PM that genuine engagement with First Nations is the only path left. For a variety of reasons, selling the pipeline to First Nations leaders is now an unofficial panic situation.\nAs things now stand, the odds are against a deal with West Coast bands on the pipeline that is supposed to carry Alberta bitumen through British Columbia and out to Asian markets.\nFrom industry and government’s perspective, time is of the essence. They want a delivery system for Alberta raw oil before other countries with energy for sale put a long-term lock on the markets that are up for grabs, particularly China.\nBy contrast, First Nations leaders will not be hustled into a quick or unsatisfactory deal. Northern Gateway is a multiple sore spot for them. They feel as though they have been ignored, marginalized and, to a degree, vilified. There was even a pitiful attempt to buy them off — with a 10-per-cent equity position in Northern Gateway. If it were only a matter of numbers, a deal-winning arrangement would be a stake at least three times as large.\nBut it’s not just dollars. It is a matter of reasonable fears by First Nations leaders about protection of the land and water in the wake of the Harper government’s gutting of environmental regulations in its anti-democratic and notorious omnibus legislation.\nIt is also a matter of trust: The Harper government doesn’t enjoy much of that in the native community these days. Normally, that wouldn’t bother a government that deals with opposition by taking out a baseball bat and going head-hunting.\nBut this time bullying and bulldozing can’t bring the First Nations into line. They have the Constitution and scores of court decisions in their favour. This time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise — if the First Nations decide to give it the chance.\nThe truth is, they might not bother.\nThis time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise — if the First Nations decide to give it the chance. The truth is, they might not bother.\nStephen Harper’s trust account is badly overdrawn. Native leaders will not soon forget how the Conservatives blithely walked away from the work-in-progress that was the Kelowna Accord.\nAlthough former prime minister Paul Martin wasn’t around long enough to implement a program that aimed at ending native poverty in a decade, his plan enjoyed wide support and created something even more seductive: a sense of optimism.\nThen-Opposition leader Stephen Harper claimed that he supported the plan to end native poverty and the principles of the Kelowna Accord, though he differed on how that should be accomplished.\nPut that in the same category with Harper’s promises not to mess with income trusts or the Old Age Supplement. Canada’s First Nations leaders have had their bags packed for that meeting for going on seven years but the invitation, apparently, is still in the mail.\nThat statement covers more than one million people.\nBut when Federal Court Judge Michael Phelan ruled in 2013 that Metis and non-status Indians were in fact “Indians” under section of 91/24 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister did not adopt the advice he once gave with such alacrity to the provinces and the territories to discharge their responsibilities. He decided instead to appeal the decision and dispute the ruling that said 600,000 “new” aboriginals came under federal jurisdiction.\nIt’s the same story on reserves after seven years of Stephen Harper — the water is still poor, the housing Third World and the health outcomes a national scandal. The best Harper could manage during the Idle No More protests aimed at holding Ottawa to its responsibilities was to mock Chief Theresa Spence.\nThe last blow to the PM’s credibility on the aboriginal street may well be the government’s vaunted native education legislation — a plan AFN Chief Shawn Atleo has already panned because it was conceived, as most of this government’s legislation is, unilaterally.\nIt is not, in the end, that Stephen Harper has done nothing for Canada’s First Nations. There has been good work on human rights, for example, and real progress on the thorny issue of matrimonial reserve property.\nThere has also been some progress on First Nation’s governance. But there has been no consistent record of striking the new relationship once promised, and which looked so promising in the lustre surrounding the government’s apology to Canada’s aboriginals for the cultural atrocities of the residential schools.\nThere are things the federal government could do to help win First Nations’ support for pipeline plans. One is to make the bands in B.C. true stakeholders by recognizing the order of wealth transfer that must take place.\nBrian Crowley and Ken Coates of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute came up with some excellent ideas: developing an advanced, evidence-based pipeline and shipping system with input from First Nations and environmental groups; designating the corridor land for pipelines as reserves under the Indian Act, thereby creating another revenue stream for First Nations which could collect taxes; and creating an endowment to cover the cost of oil spills and their clean-up — though no one believes after Exxon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon that any fund could ever hold enough money.\nEven under those circumstances, Northern Gateway is still a very tough sell, and not just to First Nations leaders. The majority of people in British Columbia oppose the project. They know that one major spill could wipe out the B.C. coast, because every salmon, halibut, sea lion, gray whale and sea bird goes past the mouth of the Douglas Channel, where hundreds of tankers would be navigating.\nBut the Conservatives’ push needs to start somewhere and it would probably be a good thing if Stephen Harper opts to meet with Canada’s aboriginals in some place other than court. There will never be progress on this file as long as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada owns the dubious record of having the biggest legal bills in the federal government.\nTrust is earned — not litigated."

        "text": "The arrest of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez exposes Venezuela’s Potemkin democracy and Hugo Chavez’s poisonous legacy.\nA few days after Venezuelan caudillo Hugo Chavez expired, his body saturated with cancer he believed was implanted in him by the CIA, I sat on an MSNBC panel encircled by academics sympathetic to the dead autocrat. Vastly outnumbered by halfwits and fellow travellers, I reached for the most conciliatory point available. “Chavez was no democrat,\" I muttered, after viewing clips of various silly pundits denouncing him as a dictator, \"but words mean things.\" An authoritarian, yes, but he didn't quite rise to the definitional standard of dictator. “You can go to Venezuela, you can be in the opposition, you can read [opposition newspaper] El Nacional...” And on and on I droned.\nIt was a tedious point, and one that, in pursuit of a narrow semantic argument, elided all the undemocratic developments in Venezuela since Chavez began his campaign of political and social polarization, his destruction of the country’s economy and already tattered democratic institutions. But compared to my fellow guests, I was something of a counterrevolutionary, a wrecker, an ideological deviationist serving the interests of the bourgeoise. Or the CIA. Or USAID. A particularly radical panelist, one of those sad little political pilgrims always sniffing out the next Third World utopia, had argued in the days after Chavez's death that \"the biggest problem Venezuela faced during his rule was not that Chávez was authoritarian but that he wasn’t authoritarian enough.\"\nMy academic co-panelist, so disappointed in Chavez’s apparently mild form of Castroism, can rejoice in the disastrous but sufficiently authoritarian rule of his chosen successor, the former bus driver and Chavez confidante Nicolás Maduro. But the Cuban-trained Maduro, who has variously claimed to have seen Chavez’s ghost in bird form and reported that his mentor’s apparition was spotted loitering in the Caracas subway system, rendered the autocrat-versus-dictator debate moot this week when he ordered the arrest of the handsome, telegenic, and Harvard-trained opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. It was Lopez and his allies who helped organize a series of protest marches in the past week, during which three people were brutally gunned down--and the weight of evidence, much of it marshalled by the usually pro-government newspaper Últimas Noticias, suggests that all three were killed by Maduro’s goon squads.\nSo naturally, the government ordered the arrest of...Lopez.\nAnd yesterday, at the start of a large—and illegal—opposition march (the government had a counter demonstration, which oddly wasn’t declared illegal), Lopez gave a short speech and turned himself over to the National Guard. It was an astoundingly brave bit of defiance; after all, is there a place on Earth worse than the inside of a Venezuelan prison? And a lesser man, like myself, would have sprinted to the airport and hopped the next flight to Miami. But there was Lopez, after having tenderly kissed and bid farewell to his wife, being wrenched into a waiting police van, a Venezuelan flag in one hand and a clutch of white flowers in the other. A picture that perfectly illustrated the death blow to Venezuelan democracy. Lopez would soon arrive at a military prison to await charges of incitement (!), homicide (!!), and terrorism (!!!).\nMaduro, in the lunatic tradition of his lunatic predecessor, conjured a sinister plot: “We have been informed that the ultra-right wing of Venezuela, in tandem with the ultra-right wing of Miami, apropos the bench warrant, activated foreign groups to find and kill [Lopez] so as to fuel a political crisis and lead us to civil war.\" It’s not so generous to defame and arrest a political opponent, but look how generous they were in saving his life from his fellow fascists!\nIndeed, outside of the official newspaper of the 1932 German Communist Party, is there any other organized political movement in history that is so profligate in its use if the word fascist? And if we are to allow elastic political definitions when discussing Venezuela—the moderate opposition are National Socialists, for instance—I am going to slacken my rules governing the use of the word dictator: Chavez might not have qualified, but Nicolas Maduro sure as hell does."

        "text": "Veterans Day is a federal holiday, but this year, many banks and credit unions will be open for business. Created to honor men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces, the holiday is observed annually on November 11. However, because the 11th falls on a Saturday in 2017, most government offices and schools will be closed on Friday, November 10.\nWhat does that mean for banks? Will they be closed both Friday and Saturday? Here’s the latest scoop on Veterans Day banking hours. Keep in mind, if your bank is closed, most major banks have mobile apps that allow you to check your balance, pay bills, and transfer funds. And if you need cash, make sure you use an ATM that is associated with your bank so you don’t have to pay a hefty fee to withdraw some holiday weekend cash.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank will be closed on Veterans Day, but some banks have opted to stay open on Friday and/or Saturday. While some financial institutions may open for limited holiday hours, others, including TD Bank, will be open regular business hours on Friday and Saturday.\nAccording to the Holiday Schedule, in addition to TD Bank, many other major banks will also stay open during regular business hours on Friday, including Bank of America, Citibank, Chase, Capital One, Citizens, HBSC, PNC, Santander, SunTrust, US Bank, and Wells Fargo.\nOn Saturday, it’s going to be hit or miss with bank hours. Many banks are open limited hours on weekends, but most will be closed to observe the Veterans Day holiday on Saturday, November 11. Branch offices for some banks located in retail stores and supermarkets may be open, but it’s important to call ahead to confirm hours at the branch office near you.\nTo add to the confusion about what’s open and what’s closed, federal offices — including the IRS, Social Security, federal courthouses, the DMV/RMV, and local social services and food stamp offices — will be closed on Friday, November 10 in observance of the Veterans Day holiday. However, the U.S. Postal Service will be open on Friday and closed on Saturday.\nAlthough banks and government offices will be closed on either Friday or Saturday, rest assured that retail stores and restaurants will be open throughout the three-day weekend. According to a previous report by the Inquisitr, numerous restaurants will be offering free meals for veterans and active duty military this weekend to honor the brave men and women who have served, or are currently serving, in the U.S. Armed Forces."

If she had, permission would’ve been denied.\nDespite her repeated denials, there were at least two attempts to hack into her system. Neither was ever reported to State’s security personnel, as required.\nClinton claimed she used a private system strictly for convenience. But when urged to also use an official email address, she refused, citing the risk that personal emails might become publicly accessible.\nTellingly, Clinton and top aides Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Cheryl Mills refused to be interviewed by the IG.\nHere’s the bottom line: Virtually everything Clinton has said about her emails has been a lie. And no longer can supporters laugh off Emailgate so easily.\nHillary’s culpability and her flouting of the law now seem clear. But that leaves one more shoe to drop: Will Attorney General Loretta Lynch indict the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee? If she doesn’t, she’ll need a good excuse why."

        "text": "The write-up “Doctor had thyself” (Spectrum, October 4) took up the issue of professional ethics among doctors. Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\nAll human concerns and considerations are at stake so much so that each patient is considered a milch-cow. But all this is antithetical to the concept of a welfare state. Healthcare matters more than anything else in India.\nThe government, intelligentsia, law enforcing agencies and charitable organisations must rise to the occasion and curb illegal and undesirable medical practices. The marketing of drugs should be strictly regulated and supervised. Justice should be prompt and deterrent.\nThe role of a doctor in society ought to be consoling, sustaining and elevating in order to revive the erstwhile cordial and courteous bonds in doctor patient relationship. Still a roaring practice laced with milk of human kindness, credibility and self-esteem will bring fame, prestige and money. Introspect deeply and act resolutely.\nVaranasi or Banaras (Spectrum, October 11) was one of the six flourishing places in the days of the Buddha. British resident, Jonathan Duncan established a Sanskrit college there in 1792. Mrs Annie Besant, an activist of the Theosophical Society started Central Hindu School in 1889, which eventually developed into the Banaras Hindu University in 1915.\nWhen the celebrated Vishvanath Temple in the city was demolished and a mosque was built there under the orders of Aurangzeb, poet Chandar Bhan satirically said: “Ba-been karaamat-e-butkhaana-e-mara ai Shaikh/Agar kharaab shavad khaana-e-khuda gardad” (See the miracle of my temple. Even after its destruction it remains the abode of God).\nPeerless poet, Mirza Ghalib, visited Varanasi on December 1, 1827. He was so much enamoured with the place that he stayed there for about a month. In his poem Chiraag-e-dair (lamp of temple) he admired the city. It comprises 108 couplets, a lucky number for the Hindus. Their rosaries have 108 beads. The poet, who described Banaras as the Ka’aba of Hindustan, says, a wise man told him that doomsday would not come, as God did not want the destruction of this elegant city.\nThe practice of giving English titles to Hindi movies (“Desi movies English titles”, Spectrum, Sept 27) is not new, as many movies have had English titles throughout the history of Indian cinema. First and foremost comes to mind films like Street Singer and President which had K.L. Saigal as hero. Mother India (1957) made by Mehboob is considered a landmark in Indian cinema.\nGuru Dutt and Madhubala came up with an evergreen musical comedy Mr & Mrs. 55. Raj Kapoor produced “Boot Polish” (1956) bringing out the struggles of street children. Another one was Love in Shimla (1959) which introduced Sadhana as a new face. Evergreen hero Dev Anand starred in many movies with English titles like Taxi Driver, House No. 44, Paying Guest, CID, Love Marriage, Gambler, Jewel Thief and above all his magnum opus Guide (1966).\nIn “Road to happiness” (Saturday Extra, Sept. 12) the writer has beautifully enumerated eight points to achieve happiness, which has become a rare commodity in this materialistic and selfish world.\nI fully endorse his points. Nathaniel Cotton’s verse, which the writer quoted to buttress his points, was full of wisdom, prudence, reason, sanity and practical knowledge.\nIt is said that sympathy is a heavenly quality and should be shown to everyone in trouble to attain happiness. Kindness, goodness and loving care of one’s aged and ailing parents, contentment and peace of mind, the belief in “live and let live”, “let bygones be bygones” and practice of ahimsa (non-violence) are the key ingredients of happiness. Noble deeds, good food, good thoughts, good conduct devoid of envy, jealousy, rivalry, grudge, malice, back biting and ill-will lead to happiness. The recital of god’s name acts as an icing on the cake.\nLife is a precious gift of God. It is worth living with all its frustrations, impediments and failures. Those who live it as it comes along can solve problems; overcome hardships to achieve their goals and happiness. One should work and not remain idle to be happy. Bad habits like drinking in excess, smoking, taking opium and other such vices should be shunned as these ruin one’s happiness, home and hearth. Punctuality, the mark of civilisation and culture, must be cultivated to gain happiness.\nThinking about common good rather than about one’s own self, caring more for one’s duties than for rights and providing food, water and shelter to the have-nots can increase one’s happiness manifold. To conclude: Happy is the man, whose wish and care, a few paternal acres bound, content to breathe his native air, in his own ground."

        "text": "Robin Gibb, one of the three singing brothers of the Bee Gees, the long-running Anglo-Australian pop group whose chirping falsettos and hook-laden disco hits like “Jive Talkin’ ” and “You Should Be Dancing” shot them to worldwide fame in the 1970s, died on Sunday in London. He was 62 and lived in Thame, Oxfordshire, England.\nThe cause was complications of cancer and intestinal surgery, his family said in a statement.\nMr. Gibb had been hospitalized for intestinal problems several times in the last two years. Cancer had spread from his colon to his liver, and in the weeks before his death he had pneumonia and for a while was in a coma.\nMr. Gibb was the second Bee Gee and third Gibb brother to die. His fraternal twin and fellow Bee Gee, Maurice Gibb, died of complications of a twisted intestine in 2003 at 53. The youngest brother, Andy, who had a successful solo career, was 30 when he died of heart failure, in 1988.\nWith brilliant smiles, polished funk and adenoidal close harmonies, the Bee Gees — Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb — were disco’s ambassadors to Middle America in the 1970s, embodying the peacocked look of the time in their open-chested leisure suits and gold medallions.\nThey sold well over 100 million albums and had six consecutive No. 1 singles from 1977 to 1979. They were also inextricably tied to the disco era’s defining movie, “Saturday Night Fever,” a showcase for their music that included the hit “Stayin’ Alive,” its propulsive beat in step with the strut of the film’s star, John Travolta.\nBarry, the oldest brother, was the dominant Bee Gee for most of the group’s existence. But the lead singer for many of the early hits was Robin, whose breaking voice, gaunt frame and gloomy eyes were well suited to convey adolescent fragility. “I Started a Joke” (with the second line, “Which started the whole world crying”), “I’ve Gotta Get a Message to You,” “Massachusetts” and other heavy-hearted songs brought the Bee Gees to the top of the charts as one of the British Invasion’s most musically conservative groups.\nRobin Hugh Gibb and his twin, Maurice, were born on Dec. 22, 1949, on the Isle of Man, a British dependency in the Irish Sea. (Barry was born there in 1946.) The boys largely grew up in Manchester, England, where the family lived on the edge of poverty. Their father, Hugh, a drummer and bandleader, encouraged his sons to sing. Their mother, Barbara, was also a singer.\nAccording to Bee Gees lore, the boys’ first performance was sometime in the mid-1950s, and unplanned. They had been scheduled to perform as a lip-synching act at a movie theater in Manchester when the record broke, forcing them to sing for real.\nThe family moved to Australia in 1958, and before long the brothers, performing as the Bee Gees — for Brothers Gibb — began scoring local hits and appearing on television. They left for London in early 1967 and within weeks had signed with Robert Stigwood, the impresario who guided them in their peak years.\nThe band’s first single in Britain, “New York Mining Disaster 1941,” was released in April 1967 and reached the Top 20.\nBut in private Robin was far from dull. He and his wife, Dwina Murphy, who survives him, lived in a 12th-century former monastery in Oxfordshire that he had restored and filled with statues of Buddha and suits of armor. In Miami, his mansion was open to celebrities and politicians like Tony Blair.\nRobin briefly left the group in 1969 and tried out a solo career. After he rejoined his brothers, they scored their first No. 1 in the United States with “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” in 1971. But with harder rock taking over, the Bee Gees’ popularity ebbed, reaching bottom in 1974 with a series of supper-club gigs in England to pay off tax debts.\nAt that point their label, Atlantic, sent the brothers to Miami for musical experimentation. There, with the 1975 album “Main Course,” they reinvented the Bee Gees’ sound with Latin and funk rhythms, electronic keyboards and vocals that owed a debt to Philadelphia soul. It brought the band its first hits in years: “Nights on Broadway” and “Jive Talkin’,” which went to No. 1.\nFor many listeners, the Gibbs were the face of disco. Even “Sesame Street” got caught up in the trend, with Robin singing on the disco-themed album “Sesame Street Fever.” It went gold.\nThe Bee Gees’ 1979 album, “Spirits Having Flown,” produced three more No. 1 singles, “Too Much Heaven,” “Tragedy” and “Love You Inside Out.” Then, in 1980, the band filed a $200 million lawsuit against Mr. Stigwood, saying he had swindled them out of royalties. Mr. Stigwood countersued for defamation and breach of contract. They settled out of court and publicly reconciled.\nIn the ’80s the band’s popularity waned in the United States but remained strong abroad. Robin released three solo albums, with limited success. The Bee Gees returned with some moderate hits in the late 1990s and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. With his brothers, Mr. Gibb won six Grammys.\nIn addition to his wife and his brother Barry, Robin Gibb is survived by his sons, Spencer and Robin-John, known as R J; his daughters, Melissa and Snow; a sister, Lesley; and his mother. An earlier marriage, to Molly Hullis, ended in divorce.\nMr. Gibb had recently been working on a classical piece, “The Titanic Requiem,” with Robin-John. It had its premiere in London on April 10, played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but Robin was too ill to attend.\nDespite the Bee Gees’ close association with disco, the Gibb brothers had long insisted that they had no stake in the genre. They had simply written songs that suited their voices and caught their fancy, they said."

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) Six years after saying they wanted to explore alternative sites to downtown St. Petersburg for a new ballpark, the Tampa Bay Rays still are in search of a location.\n”Tampa is obviously very, very attractive on the list, and we expect to at some point, hopefully sooner, look there as well as some other parts of the region,” Rays owner Stuart Sternberg said Tuesday during a panel at the MLB Diversity Business Summit.\nSternberg took control of the team after the 2005 season, and in November 2007 the Rays proposed to replace Tropicana Field with a 34,000-seat, open-air stadium at the downtown site of Al Lang Field, a longtime spring training ballpark. They withdrew that plan the following June, and Sternberg said in June 2010 he wanted to explore potential sites throughout the Tampa Bay area.\nThe Rays’ lease at Tropicana Field runs through 2027. Tampa Bay hasn’t drawn more than 2 million fans at home since its first season in 1998. Despite winning 90 or more games in each of the last four seasons, the Rays haven’t topped 1.6 million in any of the last three years.\n”We haven’t had the greatest success in attracting the what we call enough fans relative to the success we’ve had on-field, and we would like to explore other part of the region, specifically Tampa and parts of St. Petersburg,” Sternberg said.\nHe said the Rays need to undertake ”a full-out exploration” of transportation and access issues.\n”Until we’re able to do all the work that’s necessary there, I won’t really have an answer for it,” he said."

        "text": "The Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York are several hours northwest of New York City, west of the Hudson River and roughly cover four counties. Considered the frontier in Colonial days, the area was dubbed the \"Borscht Belt\" or \"Jewish Alps\" in the mid-20th century for the hotels, resorts, camps and cottage colonies favored by New York City Jews escaping from the city's heat in the summer. With mountains, cool lakes, numerous streams and rivers and small towns scattered among the forests and farmlands, the area is rich in natural beauty, culture and history. The Catskills have lodging options ranging from country inns to chain hotels, cabins and campgrounds.\nApril 1 is the opening of fishing season in many areas of the Catskills, and Roscoe, in Sulllivan County, is billed the \"Fly Fishing Capital of the World.\" The Upper Beaverkill River meets the Willowemoc River in Roscoe, and the stretch of river between Roscoe and nearby Livingston Manor is open to the public. Just off Route 17 between the two towns, visit the Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum for exhibits and programs related to the sport.\nOn Memorial Day weekend, head to the Woodstock-New Paltz Arts and Crafts Fair at the Ulster County Fairgrounds for arts, crafts, music, food and wine. Running for more than 30 years, the fair has been voted one of America's best by \"Sunshine Artist\" magazine. Late May is also the time to head to Tannersville in Greene County for the Rubber Duck and Crazy Boat Races and Festival. Watch as hundreds of rubber ducks are released or build your own boat for the boat race; the festival also has crafts, music and food.\nVisit Bethel in Sullivan County in the summer to enjoy classical, jazz, rock and country music concerts at Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. Built on the site of the 1969 Woodstock Concert, Bethel Woods offers acres of landscaped grounds, with a monument listing the performers at Woodstock at one corner of the property. The museum focuses not only on the history of the famous concert but also on significant events of the 1960s, including the Civil Rights Movement and the Space Race. Just down the road in Monticello, the Monticello Raceway and Casino, or \"racino,\" offers both thoroughbred harness racing and a casino where you can try your luck at the slot machines or table games.\nHead to Greene County's Windham Mountain for the Fourth of July celebration, where you'll find a parade, a barbecue, music and a fireworks display. The mountain resort offers hiking, biking and horseback riding.\nFall, particularly early to mid-October, is the time for leisurely drives to take in the glory of the autumnal display of color anywhere in the heavily treed Catskills. Book a weekend at a resort such as the Villa Roma Resort and Conference Center in Callicoon, which offers golf, tennis, pools and an arcade room, or explore the Legend of Sleepy Hollow at the Washington Irving Inn in Hunter, a bed and breakfast with themed rooms and cottages. Hunter Mountain hosts an annual Oktoberfest on two weekends in October with music, crafts and food.\nHunting is a popular fall activity in the Catskills. Check the Department of Environmental Conservation website (dec.ny.gov) for dates and license requirements for bow and firearm hunting of deer, turkey, bear, bobcat, waterfowl and small game. You'll need permission to hunt on private property, but some public lands are open to hunting as well. Check with the local Department of Environmental Conservation or a New York Forest Ranger for maps and required permissions for public areas.\nThe long, snowy winters in the Catskills make it a destination for winter sports. Top ski resorts in the Catskills include Windham Mountain in Windham, Hunter Mountain in Hunter, Plattekill in Roxbury and Belleayre Mountain in Highmount, although many smaller venues also operate.\nDelaware County offers two ice festivals, the Winter Festival at the Walton Fairgrounds in Walton, with an ice-carving competition, ice skating, snowmobile races and local food vendors; and the Ice Harvest at Hanford Mills Museum in East Meredith, with demonstrations of ice fishing and the cutting and harvesting of ice, horse-drawn sleigh rides and plenty of warm soups and hot apple cider.\nFor an unusual holiday experience, look for a performance by Bells and Motley, a couple who play medieval and Renaissance instruments, sing, dance and celebrate at libraries and other venues throughout the area. Cap off your winter holiday with a visit to one of the area's many tree farms, where you can pick out your own Christmas tree and have it cut for you on the spot."

A mob reportedly beat up a local environmentalist who called for government officials to swim in a heavily polluted river in China.\nWe’d written about the river’s plight a week ago (check out the photo of the river to the right).\nInterestingly, the man who was assaulted was not the local business person who offered big money ($32,000) to a government environmental official if he’d swim in the polluted river, but instead they targeted a 60 year old activist who had backed the call.\nWe’re not immune “to two weights, two measures” in the US either (e.g., Wall Street getting away with economic destruction, while the little guy pays the price) but for the most part, it doesn’t involve street violence.\nIt looks like someone is not interested in cleaning up the river.\n“The whole thing lasted four or five hours until the police arrived. My father got hit in the head by six or seven people, with their fists. He is now feeling dizzy and sleeping all the time,” she added, claiming the attack had been orchestrated by local officials.\nCalls to the mobile phone of the local Communist Party chief went unanswered on Wednesday.\nWe’re heading that way fast… only with more guns.\nI foresee life as a meme for the bizarre “[You] used the internet, you always use the internet!” said by the mob.\nChina’s path to prosperity and national independence has been betrayed at every juncture by the CCP, a rancid collection of Stalinist’s and Maoist’s with a choke hold on government.

Fraud!” Or that guy in Newtown CT getting death threats because he took in a bus driver and a bunch of kids after the school shooting massacre. (Heck, right anybody who gets national attention in advocating for any gun control laws gets death threats now.)

It is so hard to just get a lap in, let alone a quick one but we got a nice clean run,\" Whincup said.\n\"That [pole] means a lot coming to a new track but we all know it is about the race today.\"\nMcLaughlin holds an 89-point series lead over van Gisbergen but appears vulnerable at The Bend after admitting he still had no idea how to tackle the $110 million circuit after spending most of Friday's practice spearing off track.\n\"It's a really unpredictable track. I have no feel for what the car will do but I am looking forward to it,\" McLaughlin said.\nLike Friday's eventful practice sessions, drivers continued to fly off the track during qualifying, spraying dirt across the circuit.\n\"I have more dirt on my car than Russell Coight,\" Nissan driver Rick Kelly laughed.\nMcLaughlin and van Gisbergen set the scene for an interesting race after they tangled during qualifying, with the latter clearly unimpressed as he walked away from a TV reporter as she tried to interview him.\nThe Bend did not discriminate when dishing out the heartache on Saturday – Holden great Craig Lowndes will start fourth last on the 28-strong grid.\nThe Bend SuperSprint round concludes with Sunday's 200m race."

        "text": "How successful has Nato's strategy been in Afghanistan?\nUnder General David Petraeus, a major plank of Nato's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) strategy has been \"kill/capture raids\" - lightning strikes on senior Taliban personnel to either take prisoner or kill.\nBut have they worked? Isaf supplies no consistent data on the policy, other than issuing a string of press releases claiming success after success, releases which often describe several raids in different places simultaneously. Researchers Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn wanted to find out exactly how the missions worked.\nYou can read their full report here. Frustrated by the lack of hard data, Strick van Linschoten scraped the reports, then used the Tinderbox database package to process each incident and extract the key numbers.\nWhat he found is a very different picture to that described by Isaf press releases. \"There are still relatively large numbers of Afghans subject to the capture-or-kill raids,\" he says.\nAlthough, interestingly, there has been a decline in these raids since Petraeus left Afghanistan in July this year.\nThe report is a fund of data crucial to understanding the way Nato has fought the conflict. We've mapped some of the key facts by province, too.\nThis data, painstakingly collated, is the first time we can get a real picture of what is happening.\nAside from occasional scraps thrown to the media by ISAF, this is the first time that we have been able to get a somewhat more nuanced picture of how ISAF is operating, minimum figures for how many people are being detained and killed as well as a makeshift way to evaluate the usefulness of ISAF's own aggregate numbers that supposedly show the successes of the raids in Afghanistan.\nStrick van Linschoten has visualised the timeline of releases below - you can explore it by clicking and dragging - or seeing it on the original site."

Subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher and anywhere else you listen to podcasts.\nThe day before President Trump’s rambling Rose Garden remarks announcing a national emergency on our southern border, I sat down with Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). All that was needed was for Congress to vote on the budget deal to avert another government shutdown and send the legislation to Trump’s desk for his signature. And Bass was clear-eyed about what Trump’s theater was masking.\nBass’s first visit to the podcast came just months after Trump’s inauguration in 2017. A time when the Los Angeles Democrat said her town halls had turned her into a “political therapist.” That all changed, Bass said, when she put anxiety into action.\nSo I asked Bass, who was part of a small CBC delegation that met with the president in March 2017, how successful the caucus could be in thwarting him and achieving its goals with Trump in the White House. “With 55 people and the amount of power that we have on a committee and subcommittee level, it’s all very doable,” she said. CBC members now chair the committees on homeland security, financial services, oversight and reform, education and labor, and science, space and technology.\nListen to the podcast to hear Bass talk more about Trump, the Democratic Party and her thoughts on the freshman House member everyone can’t seem to stop talking about: “AOC,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)."

        "text": "Mir Quasem Ali was hanged after being convicted for offences committed during 1971 war with Pakistan.\nBangladesh has executed a wealthy tycoon and top financial backer of its largest opposition party after his family paid him a final visit.\nMir Quasem Ali, a key leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, was hanged on Saturday after being convicted by a controversial war crimes tribunal of offences committed during the 1971 independence conflict with Pakistan.\n\"The execution took place at 10:35pm (16:35 GMT),\" said Anisul Huq, the country's law and justice minister.\nAli had been imprisoned in the Kashimpur high security jail in Gazipur, some 40km north of the capital Dhaka.\nAfter the Supreme Court rejected his final appeal against the penalty on Tuesday, Ali declined to seek a presidential pardon, which would require an admission of guilt.\nAli was a key commander of the pro-Pakistan militia in the southern port city of Chittagong during the 1971 war, and later became a shipping and real estate tycoon.\nPast convictions and executions of high-profile Jamaat leaders have triggered violence in Bangladesh, which is polarised along political lines.\nRussel Sheikh, a senior Gazipur police official, told the AFP news agency that officials took \"highest security measures\" ahead of the execution for fear of violence by his supporters.\n\"More than 1,000 police have been deployed in the district,\" Sheikh said.\nTalha Ahmad, a commentator and lawyer on Bangladeshi affairs, told Al Jazeera that Ali was different from other Jamaat leaders.\n\"He was a celebrated philanthropist, a very successful businessman and somebody who has done a tremendous amount of work to create free media and with vulnerable people, especially refugees,\" Ahmad said.\n\"He was one of the rare breed of Jamaat politicians who was able to reach out to the wider society. It seems government goes after anybody who is capable of mounting an intellectual and practical challenge to the them. The government has become so authoritarian recently that it doesn't allow any opposition activism at all, whether it is Jamaat or any other party.\"\nThe Supreme Court's decision to reject Ali's appeal was a major blow for the Jamaat-e-Islami party, which the 63-year-old tycoon had helped to revive in recent decades.\nFive opposition leaders have been executed for war crimes since 2013. Ali was the last prominent leader of Jamaat to face execution.\nThe war crimes tribunal set up by the government has divided the country, with supporters of Jamaat and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party branding it a sham aimed at eliminating their leaders.\nAli was convicted in November 2014 of a series of crimes during Bangladesh's war of separation from Pakistan, including the abduction and murder of a young independence fighter.\nHis son, Mir Ahmed Bin Quasem, who was part of his legal defence team, was allegedly abducted by security forces earlier in August, which critics say was an attempt to sow fear and prevent protests against the execution."

        "text": "PARIS – French children go to school four days a week. They have about two hours each day for lunch. And they have more vacation than their counterparts almost anywhere in the West.\nIt may sound a bit like the famously leisurely work pace enjoyed by their parents, most of whom work 35 hours per week as dictated by law.\nBut the nation&apos;s new government says elementary school kids risk classroom burnout, and is moving to help them cope. The issue: French school days may be relatively few, but they are at least as long as a day of work for adults. Even 6-year-olds are in class until late into the afternoon, when skies are dark, attention flags and stomachs rumble.\nAs a candidate, President Francois Hollande promised to change things by adding a fifth day of classes on Wednesday while shortening the school day. For France, it&apos;s something of a revolutionary idea that would overturn more than a century of school tradition. The thinking is that the days are too full for young children under the current system and that Wednesday free time could be put to more productive use.\n\"France has the shortest school year and the longest day,\" Hollande said at the time, promising change.\nHis education minister, Vincent Peillon, will decide this month how to carry out the reform. He has said he may also compensate for a shorter school day by trimming France&apos;s sacred summer vacation. A panel of experts will present their conclusions on Friday, and the president is expected to address the issue on Tuesday.\nNo proposal affects tradition — and potentially family and municipal budgets — as much as what the French call changes to the \"scholastic rhythms.\"\nThere&apos;s been a midweek break in French primary schools dating back to the 19th century, a government concession to the Roman Catholic Church, which wanted children to study the catechism on their weekday off. In today&apos;s secular France, Wednesdays currently are a blur of sports, music, tutoring for families of means, or a scramble for working parents struggling to get by — who must either find a sitter or send their kids to a full day at a state-run \"leisure center.\"\nThings aren&apos;t exactly easy for French kids.\nDespite long summer breaks and the four-day school week, French elementary school students actually spend more hours per year in school than average — 847, compared with 774 among countries in OECD, a club of wealthy nations. But the time is compressed into fewer days each year. The French school day begins around 8:30 and ends at 4:30 p.m., even for the youngest, despite studies showing the ability of young children to learn deteriorates as the day goes on.\nBut many parents are afraid that the changes will force them to figure out extra childcare five days a week, especially at schools where the afterschool program amounts to sitting silently at a desk for two hours or near-chaos in the play areas. Under the education proposal, school would end at lunchtime on Wednesday.\n\"It&apos;s completely unrealistic,\" Valerie Marty, president of the national parents&apos; organization, said of the proposed timetable. \"They have to figure out who will take care of the children after school, who will finance it.\"\nIn France, the answer is usually the government.\nThe state is expected to provide for just about everything education-related: Classes come under the national budget, and lunches and leisure are the domain of municipalities. So if school lets out most days at 3:30 p.m., under the plan most recently floated, more working parents than ever would need afterschool care — and towns would have to figure out what to do with restless children. That would almost certainly involve something more constructive than sitting quietly at desks, kicking around a ball, or playing cards until the evening when parents get out of work.\nThe Education Ministry has proposed more organized extracurricular activities like sports, theater and art to replace the relatively free form time children now have after school. But that means trained staff and, of course, more money from local budgets already strained in difficult economic times.\nMarty, who has three children, proposes something entirely different: lengthening lunch to three hours.\n\"After a meal, children have a moment when they&apos;re tired. They&apos;re not ready for intellectual activities and could do something more relaxing,\" she said, suggesting theater, or quiet time in a library for others. Afterward, she said, classes could resume until evening.\nTrimming the hallowed summer break is another tricky proposition. The school year ends at the beginning of July. Some families take July off, some August. But nearly everyone takes a month, and many French families travel for the entire period.\nPeillon said he was flexible about vacation time: \"If the question of vacation is blocking things, I&apos;ll propose that the prime minister leave it alone.\"\nEric Charbonnier, an OECD education expert supports the proposed changes. He believes the current system isn&apos;t working for the children most in need of a good education.\n\"A schedule with long days and lots of vacation is not one that will help the students who are having problems,\" he said.\nPeter Gumbel, a British journalist who has lived in France since 2002 and written a book about the country&apos;s education system, said the length of the school day is only part of the problem. He says that French schooling is outmoded, dull and grinding. His take is clear from his book&apos;s title: \"They Shoot Schoolchildren, Don&apos;t They?\"\n\"You have to tackle head-on the fundamental questions of the classroom,\" he said, citing \"the sheer heaviness of the national curriculum, the enormous amount of hours, the enormous amount of unbroken attention required, and the sheer boredom and tiredness.\""

        "text": "A lot has changed since the Federal Reserve decided in September once again to take a pass at raising interest rates and normalizing monetary policy. For hawks, not much of it has been particularly good.\nWhen choosing not to move last month, the Federal Open Market Committee referred to some vague \"international developments\" it was monitoring to decide when it would enact its first rate hike since 2006.\nFor Wall Street, the message was clear: Fed officials worried that the slowdown in China would spread to other areas of the global economy, dampening prospects at home and making it the wrong time to lift off from the zero-bound range where it has been for seven years.\nSince then, the news from China has gotten marginally better, with the government reporting that gross domestic product gained 6.9 percent in the most recent period.\nThe news from home, though, has improved little. Expectations for U.S. third-quarter GDP have tumbled in recent weeks, with the consensus now at just a 1.7 percent gain, according to FactSet, down from 3.9 percent in the inventory-inflated second quarter and well off hopes for 2.5 percent or better. CNBC's Rapid Update tracker has the estimate down to 1.4 percent.\nA batch of economic data points Tuesday helped drive home the weakness: Consumer confidence declined and was below economist expectations, orders for long-lasting goods fell in line with consensus at 1.2 percent, and the Markit Purchasing Managers Index survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level since January, with the hiring component particularly worrisome.\nIndeed, the jobs market, considered perhaps the brightest spot in the economy, has tailed off considerably, with September adding just 142,000 positions, according to the latest government report that came out after the last Fed meeting.\nNot to mention corporate profits, which currently are tracking for a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\"Global weakness, a large inventory overhang, economic uncertainty — take your pick. The current environment leaves businesses hesitant to invest in everything from equipment to structures to additional employees,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, said in summing up the most recent indicators.\nThe conditions add up to a headache for the Fed during a year in which Chair Janet Yellen and her top lieutenants repeatedly have expressed a desire to begin the rate normalization process. The first hike was supposed to happen in March, which would have been five months after the Fed ended its quantitative easing program, a series of monthly bond purchases that exploded the central bank's balance sheet past $4.5 trillion.\nNow, the target again appears to be March, but in 2016. Traders at the CME assign just a 1 in 20 chance that the FOMC will announce a hike on Wednesday. The outlook has dimmed so much that traders say there's a 16 percent probability the Fed will still hold steady next September.\nFed watchers should expect the FOMC to tone down its assessment of the economy in the statement it releases at the meeting's conclusion, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"The financial markets will treat the marking down of the Fed's near-term assessment of the economy as dovish, thereby further reducing the probability of a December 2015 rate hike, because the data will simply not be strong enough to convince the financial markets the Fed can actually begin tightening,\" LaVorgna said in a note.\n\"And if the Fed determines that it really wants to raise rates this year, the likely tightening in financial conditions that would accompany such a desire would give policymakers pause,\" he added. \"Therefore, we do not expect a rate hike until the March 2016 meeting at the earliest.\"\nSure, there's been a rebound of sort in the global equity markets, but even that only seems to exemplify how much investors have come to depend on monetary largess from the Fed and its global counterparts. The S&P 500 index had been in a sharp tumble around the time of the September meeting, falling more than 12 percent from its July peak until it cratered 12 days after the FOMC decision.\nSince then, the market is up nearly 10 percent, buoyed in part by hopes of a lower-for-longer Fed.\nSumming up the Faustian bargain between the two entities, Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote, \"Global weakness is OK for U.S. markets as long as the Fed refrains from hiking rates, and vice versa it would be OK from a markets perspective for the Fed to begin hiking rates if global weakness diminishes (but not OK if US data rebounds in isolation).\"\nMikkelsen added that it's important the Fed acknowledge that the U.S. growth story is deteriorating.\n\"Hence risk assets have rallied for three weeks prompted by the turn to weaker U.S. data that began with the weak September jobs report, as the Fed's rate decision is understood to be completely data dependent,\" he said. \"However, clearly for the market rally to be sustained it would be helpful if (the) FOMC statement tilted dovish by acknowledging this turn to weaker U.S. data.\""

        "text": "According to c8sciences.com, “While they share some of their respective symptoms, the definitions of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Executive Function Disorder aren’t quite the same. There is a definite difference between ADHD and Executive Function Disorder. A child or adult with ADHD might be hyperactive, inattentive, and/or impulsive, and while clinicians have always had a grasp on impulsivity and hyperactivity, the concept of inattention has evolved from a simple focus on “inability to stay on task” to a broader concept of “executive functioning”. Executive Functioning problems involve a pattern of chronic difficulties in executing daily tasks.” With that said, this article will describe the difference between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Executive Function Disorder.\nAccording to c8sciences.com, “Wouldn’t it make sense, then, that someone experiencing issues with executive functioning may have problems analyzing, planning, organizing, scheduling and completing tasks? Children and adults with EFD exhibit issues with organizing materials and setting schedules; they misplace papers, reports and other school materials and often times will have similar problems keeping track of their personal items or even keeping their bedroom organized. No matter how hard they try, the failure rate remains.” With that said, children and adults with Executive Function Disorder have difficulty with organization and setting schedules.\nWith that said, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Executive Function Disorder are similar to one another. However, it is also important to note that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Executive Function Disorder are also different from one another. To be specific, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity focuses on staying focused on tasks. In contrast to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Executive Function Disorder focuses more on completing tasks. Therefore, to conclude this article, on a final note, similarities do exist between Executive Function Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder but so do differences, as well."

And it doesn't have to be created with paint on canvas, sculpted from clay, or chiseled in stone.\nSometimes all it takes is a simple piece of chalk and a public sidewalk. That's the theory behind the annual Chalk Art Festival, which is June 13 at the Uptown Shopping Center in Richland. Registration starts at 8 a.m. Chalkers will begin their work at 9 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m.\n\"Chalk art is a wonderful and unique form of creativity,\" said Gus Sako, the event's organizer and owner of the Octopus' Garden novelty store in the Uptown.\n\"Give the smallest toddler a piece of chalk and sidewalk and they will be happy for hours,\" he said.\n\"I get off work and usually just head to the sidewalk,\" she said with a chuckle. \"It's just too irresistible not to take part.\"\nBoth women also say creating chalk art can wreak havoc on the body, especially the knees, the back and shoulders.\n\"It's pretty hard for anyone to whip out a drawing in the hot sun on a dirty sidewalk. And, at almost 66, my knees are pretty creaky,\" Loomis said. \"On the other hand, my kids just gave me a gardening stool with rails that might be just the thing!\"\nCalicoat says creating chalk art is like doing one-arm push ups for hours.\n\"I've been trying to train myself to use my left hand to paint so I'll probably do the same thing with chalk,\" Calicoat said.\nThe Chalk Art Festival was started by the now defunct Corporate Council for the Arts as a regional arts activity, Sako said. The festival moved to several locations until it finally settled at the Uptown a few years ago.\nCategories and registration fees are: Up to age 5 $5; Ages 6-9 $5; Ages 10-12 $7; Ages 13-17 $7; Ages 18 and older $12.

        "text": "Don Keough thinks Ireland should have a Diaspora Minister, saying it would transform Diaspora/Irish relations.\nHe also wants to see Notre Dame back in Dublin playing football in the next couple of years. Tourism leaders will surely salivate after 30,000 US fans showed up the last time they played.\nHe has just helped raise $3 million for a world class 1916 Rising documentary prepared at Notre Dame and already bought by RTE Public Television in the US and the BBC.\nHe also believes that Ireland faced the worst crisis any western government had after the economic collapse and that American business leaders are keenly aware of how well they have handled it.\nHe is the man who brought Notre Dame and Coca-Cola to Ireland. He also brought Bill Gates and Warren Buffett his lifelong friend too, hosting them at the K Club on their first ever visit. He serves on Berkshire Hathaway’s board with Buffett and is still an advisor to the board of Coca-Cola, the company he served for 40 years.\nAs president of Coca-Cola he blazed the multinational trail to Ireland in the 1970s. As Chairman of the Board at Notre Dame he created the Keough-Naughton Irish Institute in 1994 and their Dublin campus and laid the groundwork for the university to play in Dublin in September 2012.\nAt 86 he is far from a back number. He is Chairman of the Board of Allen and Company, the New York investment bank, and co-hosts their annual Sun Valley retreat attended by world business leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch.\nHe divides his time still between New York and Atlanta, his home, and keeps a schedule a younger man would surely tire of. Every year he visits his beloved Ireland with his family and recently paid a visit to New Ross in Wexford and the famine-era replica ship like the one his great-grandfather Michael embarked on back in the 1840s.\nHe has come a long way from Michael’s lonely journey. Warren Buffet once stated that two men he met in business, Jack Welch and Don Keough, could have become president of the United States if they had chosen a political rather than a business career.\nKeough demurs, but there is little doubt that he has been Ireland’s greatest advocate in America for decades now. His sense of the potential of the Diaspora was uppermost in his mind during our New York interview.\nHow would you approach the Diaspora if you were the Irish government?\nIf a person wants to be part of that Diaspora the Irish government needs to acknowledge that. A good start would be a Minister for the Diaspora, who would be charged with creating that welcome and outreach.\nI know when you become an Irish citizen in Ireland there is an event around it. If you announce you are of the Diaspora and coming to Ireland that is important too.\nIsrael has a minister of the Diaspora, I read in the New York Times, where and I quote, “Over the next five years the Israeli government will spend $1.4 billion on a range of initiatives to strengthen Jewish identity abroad and Jewish connections to Israel and vice versa.” That is the kind of thinking we need.\nThere should be someone as Minister who is a constant part of the Diaspora, who is reporting back to cabinet.\nIt is an asset that needs to be used. Just to announce that minister would be huge all over the world.\nI was delighted to see Irish President Higgins mention and dedicate his trip to the Irish Diaspora in Britain in his remarks during the state visit.\nWe are everywhere across this world, this Irish army waiting to help this small country their people left from.\nThink of it – 70 million people worldwide, millions of whom are seeking a relationship with their ancestral home. What an opportunity!\nIf the Notre Dame game can bring 35,000 people to Ireland what could a massive outreach do? The Notre Dame game demonstrated what was possible. It was the ultimate power of the Diaspora that they didn’t just come to the game – they captured the country.\nI was at church last week in Atlanta. A couple who came to the game came up and told me they were returning again, they fell utterly in love with Ireland. They are just one small example of what I’m saying.\nWhat is the upside potential for the Diaspora do you think?\nI think within a matter of five years you would double the number of people who would visit Ireland. That would be my goal.\nIt needs preparation; Diaspora packages need to be put together. A self-proclaimed member of the Diaspora should feel like Notre Dame fans do, part of something bigger, greater than the sum of its parts. There should be special discounts, meetings, and outreach.\nLook what we did with Notre Dame – 35,000 came and there was a massive range of activities.\nThe visit to Ireland is always enjoyable, despite the weather sometimes. Ireland and what it continues to represent is the best argument for itself.\nWhat brought you there first to your Irish roots?\nWell, I wanted to bring my children to Ireland. My father had gone late in his life and he was deeply moved by it. I’ll never forget how proud he was to go.\nIt was the memory of my father. It was the happiest trip of his life, and he said he was so upset he didn’t go when he was younger so that was always on my mind. So the first time I went was when I could afford it. My father touched Ireland for me.\nI brought my children and we drove everywhere. This was the early 1970s. I was so excited. I wanted to get involved. I remember years later reading your magazine Irish America and saying, finally, someone gets it.\nYou first created the links between the University of Notre Dame and Ireland. There was very little connection until you came along. What made you want to do it?\nWell, Notre Dame had an extraordinary Irish background. Almost all the presidents had Irish connections. It was just waiting to be connected into Ireland.\nWhat made me do the Keough-Naughton Irish Institute was Professor Chris Fox, who I had met, and he told me we had an amazing Irish collection of books and major historical links and he had a deep interest in Ireland. I said, “Why don’t you do something?” Then the issue was how do we get it started.\nSo I talked to Seamus and said, “You have some amazing ideas about what an Irish studies program should be like we’ll give you the blank canvas and the paints and you paint the Irish studies program you want at the home of the Irish in America.” By golly, that was what exactly he did.\nOne of the most exciting things in my life has been to see it develop the way it has. It was perfect timing and Chris was a great leader, and the university supported it totally.\nSome 10,000 students have studied there in the past 20 years and thousands go to Ireland. Then Martin Naughton came on board as my partner. He has been amazing.\nMartin and his family played a massive role in the success of Notre Dame game. It became a happening because of Martin and it was great that the Taoiseach was fully involved, and we even got the weather!\nI always remember telling Martin about the idea of the game and really getting the Irish involved. He asked, “What took you so long?” It was a huge boost to the institute and we have enlarged our efforts and numbers in Ireland since.\nYou have a great new Irish project as well.\nYes, the 1916 landmark documentary series. BBC, RTE and PBS will show a three-part landmark documentary about the 1916 Rising and we have raised the money, almost $3 million for it. We are very excited about that. The series will run to coincide with the centenary of the Easter Rising.\nWhat has Ireland meant to you overall?\nIreland has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. To have such an involvement there is a privilege. My family loves it and we have all spent amazing times there. I wanted to buy a house there, but my wife Mickie said I’d never leave it.\nHow is Ireland doing now in your opinion?\nSo the Kenny government had no easy way to solve the problems, and so they had the toughest job of any country in the world.\nThey have done well. You hear a lot of respect for Ireland now over here. They faced the toughest problems and were the first to demonstrate that they were working their way out of it.\nI look on what happened with a lot of pride on how they have done it. It has been very tough on the Irish people I know, but you have to give them credit. I’m very optimistic about what is going to happen. A lot of smart Americans are getting involved there now, guys like John Malone.\nWill you bring Notre Dame football back to Ireland?\nIt is not up to me but my own view is they will be back. The call to Ireland for Notre Dame is very strong. Maybe within the next couple of years.\nAre you still bullish on US?\nWhen I talk about the US I say never bet against it, these are the most resilient people in the world.\nWe have an amazing gene pool a collection of people from all over the world who came not to exploit but to find a new way to grow and develop, many of them were running away from poverty and oppression.\nThey could see hope here those that came. It took enormous courage for people to get up and leave in the first place.\nI’m an absolute optimist; my own journey proves it from a small farm in Iowa to the presidency of Coca-Cola.\nWho do you consider inspirational figures?\nFather Ted Hesburgh at Notre Dame. He is an absolute inspiration; still a simple priest. His most important moment in his life is when he says Mass.\nI took him to Latin America once. We called on several heads of state. The minute I brought him in there they paid no attention to me. He spoke to them in Portuguese, Spanish and charmed them all.\nHe was an incredible visionary who served six presidents on issues such as civil rights and immigration and built one of the great universities. There were those who said a Catholic university could never reach the heights of academic excellence, but Father Hesburgh knew differently.\nWarren Buffet still tap dances to work every day. He has arranged to give all his wealth away, but he’d be rich in every important way with or without it.\nHe lives a very simple life. We have been friends for decades. I lived across the street from him in Omaha many years ago and he still lives there, in a modest house, like the man.\nOutside of my own father, of the people I have worked with Warren Buffett stands out. He is a learning machine, a great philanthropist. He has kept an amazing sense of humility.\nWhat is the best life lesson you have learned?\nThe life lesson I have learned is that wealth has nothing to do with money. It has to do with family, with friendships, with knowing and learning from interesting people, people who make a difference. If I didn’t have ten dollars I’d consider myself one of the wealthiest people in the world with the friends and family I have had.\nI say to my grandkids, you need to be an interesting person, and not just learn how to move your thumbs around an iPhone or iPad. No one wants to be around uninteresting people I tell them. Young people today don’t want to be vulnerable. They want to be cool, the worst possible thing to be.\nI tell them you need to go through life saying this is who I am comfortable in my skin, for better or worse. Take me for what I am."

        "text": "WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said on Monday that the United States wanted a ceasefire in Afghanistan during Eidul Azha because this was also the desire of the Afghan people.\nThe Afghan government announced on Sunday that it wanted a ceasefire in the country during this Eid like the one that was observed during Eidul Fitr, which allowed rival Afghan factions, particularly the Taliban, to celebrate the religious festival peacefully with their families.\nBut Mr Pompeo and Afghan officials both said that for this ceasefire to happen, it was necessary for the Taliban to desire it as well.\n“This plan responds to the clear and continued call of the Afghan people for peace,” Mr Pompeo said.\nHe noted that the last ceasefire in Afghanistan revealed the deep desire of the Afghan people to end the conflict. “And we hope another ceasefire will move the country closer to sustainable security,” the chief US diplomat said.\nMr Pompeo said the US supported this initiative because “it is our hope and that of the international community that the Afghan people may celebrate Eidul Azha this year in peace, free from fear”. He said the US also supported Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s offer for comprehensive negotiations with the Taliban on a mutually agreed agenda. “We remain ready to support, facilitate, and participate in direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban,” said the US diplomat.\nEarlier this week, Mr Pompeo telephoned the Saudi crown prince and also asked him to help arrange a ceasefire during Eidul Azha. The United States hopes that the ceasefire will enable the Taliban to experience the blessings of peace while celebrating the festival with their families.\nMr Pompeo, who will be arriving in Islamabad after the ceasefire, is expected to urge the new Pakistani government to back its efforts for bringing a durable peace in Afgha­nistan. In return for Pakistan’s support in Afghanistan, Washington may drop its opposition to a $12 billion aid package with the IMF and consider restoring its security assistance to Pakistan.\nAfghanistan was on Monday awaiting the Taliban’s response to President Ghani’s proposal for a three-month ceasefire, an offer welcomed by the US and Nato after nearly 17 years of war, according to AFP.\nThe president said his office had cleared “all obstacles” to peace with the announcement following consultations with religious scholars, political parties and civil society groups.\nThe Taliban did not immediately respond to President Ghani’s truce offer, but vowed to release “hundreds” of “enemy prisoners” to mark the Eidul Azha holiday. A Taliban member told AFP that the leadership had yet to issue a formal response to the ceasefire, but suggested fighting might be restrained during Eid even if no announcement was made."

        "text": "SANOK, POLAND — In the far southeast corner of Poland, the warm summer air is resounding with the rasp of old-fashioned iron saws and the satisfying twack-twack-twack of ax blades on wood.\nHere, in the foothills of the Carpathians, an international crew of master timber craftsmen and students has been working on an intensely hands-on project that combines history, art and education. They are building a replica of the tall peaked roof and inner cupola of an ornate wooden synagogue that stood for 300 years in the town of Gwozdziec, now in Ukraine.\nThe replica, which will be 85 percent of the original size of the building, will be installed as one of the key components of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, currently under construction in Warsaw and scheduled to open in 2013.\nIts elaborate structure and the intricate painted decoration on the cupola ceiling will reproduce a form of architectural and artistic expression that was wiped out in World War II, when the Nazis put the torch to some 200 wooden synagogues in Eastern Europe. Many of them, like that in Gwozdziec, were centuries old and extraordinarily elaborate, with tiered roofs and richly decorative interior painting.\nThe Gwozdziec Synagogue, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, was a “truly resplendent synagogue that exemplified a high point in Jewish architectural art and religious painting,” the architectural historian Thomas C. Hubka, an expert on the building, has written.\nConstructing the replica is a joint project of the museum in Warsaw and the Handshouse Studio, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that emphasizes learning by building, particularly the reconstruction of historical structures and other objects.\nThe Browns conducted years of research on Eastern Europe’s lost wooden synagogues before embarking on construction of the Gwozdziec replica in Sanok in May. They studied prewar photographs, drawings and other documentation, built models and made on-site investigations of wooden churches and other buildings still found in Poland and Ukraine.\nThere are also several impressive masonry synagogues within an easy drive of Sanok. The 18th-century synagogue in Lancut, now a museum, has beautifully restored interior painting and other decoration. One in Rymanow stood for decades as a ruin but has been partially rebuilt, with a tall peaked roof now protecting the vigorous but sadly fading frescoes of Biblical animals and Jerusalem that grace its walls.\nIn Lesko, the 17th-century synagogue was rebuilt in the 1960s and today houses a gallery of local arts and crafts. Lesko’s vast Jewish cemetery, just a short walk away, is one of the oldest in Poland, with massive tombstones dating to the 16th century.\nFor the Gwozdziec project, an international team of nearly 30 master craftsmen from the Timber Framers Guild are being joined by groups of students from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where the Browns teach.\nTimber framers came from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Belgium and Japan to lend their skills, all on a volunteer basis.\nAll the work is being carried out using techniques and tools that the builders of the original synagogue would have used: axes, saws, mallets and other hand-held implements. The aim is to gain an understanding of just what went into the building of the synagogue and how its construction would have been envisaged and carried out — and also to lend authenticity to the replica.\n“It brings back the lost story of the synagogue, the town, this culture,” said Patrick Goguen, a student at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.\nThe project is occurring in several stages. Building the timber-framed roof and cupola is the first stage, running through June. Students and artists will hold workshops this summer and next summer to reproduce the intricate polychrome painting that adorned the ceiling of the cupola. These workshops will be held in eight Polish towns in masonry synagogues that still stand.\nThe timber framing is taking place in a corner of Sanok’s Ethnographic Park, a sprawling open-air folk-architecture museum that displays wooden buildings — houses, barns, churches, chapels and even beehives — that have been transferred from a number of villages in the region.\nHere, thick logs are being hewn by hand into flat-sided timbers — a process that can take two days per log — and then manually sawed into thinner pieces. The components are then shaped and joined without nails."

        "text": "The SNP's internal feud reached new depths of bitterness last night when party leader Alex Salmond was told by treasurer Ian Blackford to apologise for criticisms made last week or face being sued for defamation.\nAs moves continued to oust Mr Blackford, the party was also preparing disciplinary action against one of his closest allies, Ms Margo MacDonald, who faces accusations of breaking internal rules by publicly challenging a parliamentary group decision.\nMs MacDonald, a critic of Mr Salmond's leadership style, will be dealt with on Thursday at a meeting which her supporters claim could mark the start of a campaign to have her deselected.\nNationalist spokesmen desperately sought to play down the effects of the furious row which erupted between Mr Salmond and Mr Blackford last week over reports that the SNP was in deep financial trouble.\nPress officer Kevin Pringle refused to give details of the behind-the-scenes leadership attack on Mr Blackford at the weekend party executive meeting which passed a motion of no confidence in him by 18 votes to three.\nSNP rules allow the executive to admonish, suspend or expel a member - which some observers think could be the leadership's next move if Mr Blackford stays put.\nParty insiders have pointed privately to Mr Blackford as the source of recent stories about the SNP's financial state. Mr Blackford has hotly denied any wrongdoing. The cause of the row is Mr Blackford's reputedly hard line as treasurer in drawing up tough housekeeping rules for the party which is in debt.\nHe is thought privately to believe Mr Salmond and former chief executive Michael Russell, together spent irresponsibly during the Scottish Parliament elections and then left him to clear up the financial mess. Mr Blackford has repeatedly said that as a prominent and wealthy banker in Edinburgh he must ensure his conduct is above reproach because his professional reputation is on the line.\nThe latest dispute between the leader and treasurer involves the extent of the party's overdraft and the effectiveness of Mr Blackford's efforts to have it cleared before the General Election.\nHe and Mr Salmond were involved in an acrimonious dispute last summer after The Herald revealed that Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter had made a major contribution - said to be about #200,000 - to the SNP but had not been named as the source. Rules at the time did not require the identity of major donors to be revealed but parties had agreed to abide by the spirit of the new procedures.\nMr Blackford irritated Mr Salmond, who claimed the SNP had behaved perfectly properly, with his insistence that there must be no\"jiggery pokery\".\nRelations between the two men have never recovered and hit a new low last week with newspaper claims that the SNP was broke and had been forced to sell its Edinburgh HQ to help pay off an overdraft believed to be #400,000.\nIn fact, the SNP had planned long ago to sell its offices. The party is believed to have struck an agreement on the sale last week and it must now find a new headquarters.\nProceeds from the sale are not expected to be used in clearing the overdraft which deputy party leader John Swinney predicted last month would be paid off around the end of this year and which was about #600,000 at its worst.\nMr Blackford, who is reputedly wealthy, told Radio Clyde that when he was involved in talks with his bank about personally helping the SNP out of its financial difficulty, Mr Salmond was encouraging former party leader Willie Wolfe to run against him as treasurer. Mr Wolfe subsequently withdrew.\"I don't need lessons from Alex Salmond on integrity or trust,\" Mr Blackford said.\nThe SNP would not confirm a report that Mr Salmond accused Mr Blackford of incompetence and of destabilising the party and had appeared to blame him for the overspend.\nHe rejected suggestions that he and allies like Ms MacDonald were being purged as an offensive against dissidents.\"I don't believe in conspiracy theories,\" he said.\nMr Blackford pointed out that his treasurer's report to the national council last month had been accepted without questioning.\nMs MacDonald incurred the wrath of the leadership when she complained publicly about the parliamentary party's refusal to set aside SNP debating time in the chamber for her ideas for exploring the use of cannabis, particularly as an aid to those suffering pain. She accused some of her colleagues of\"reneging\" on the issue.\nbetween the leader and treasurer.\nLabour revelled in the SNP disarray. Scotland Office Minister Brian Wilson said:\"Alex Salmond's control freak tendencies have finally come home to roost. Having ousted the party treasurer in the night of the long sgian dubhs he has now turned his sights on the independence-minded Margo MacDonald."

        "text": "Quite frankly, thoughts and prayers can only go so far. They have limited ability to protect our families. The time has come for our elected leaders – including President Barack Obama – to stand up and fight for our families and children, and their safety.\nBut the American people support stronger gun safety measures more than he believes or cares to say. Polls now demonstrate this to be true.\nWhen our children are being shot at and killed in their schools, or movie theaters, we have to take meaningful action. These tragedies are too frequent, and are, as the president said, heartbreaking.\nWe need to talk about gun laws. We need an open and honest debate about the tragedies happening in our communities, one after another. There are common-sense laws that can help prevent these tragedies, and Americans support them.\nThe “Fix Gun Checks Act,” if passed, would make it tougher for the mentally ill to legally buy guns by strengthening background checks so people like James Holmes (the Aurora shooter) can’t acquire guns. Ninety percent of Americans want to fix gaps in government databases that allow the mentally ill or drug users from buying guns. Even gun owners support the laws.\nEighty-two percent of gun owners (National Rifle Association and non-NRA members) believe that a criminal background check should be required for anyone purchasing a gun, according to data released by Republican pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns earlier this year, 76 percent of gun owners support prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns, 80 percent support mandatory gun safety training for anyone applying for a concealed permit, and 78 percent of gun owners believe that concealed permits should only be granted to applicants who have not committed violent misdemeanors.\nThe NRA, which fights against all this, is out of touch — even with its own membership. Its power to dictate this debate has to be challenged.\nThe data on assault weapons is just as telling. The man identified Friday as the gunman, Adam Lanza was armed with semiautomatic pistols and a semiautomatic rifle and the killers in Aurora and Portland both used an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle. Sixty-three percent of Americans said they favor a nationwide ban on assault weapons, according to a 2011 CBS/New York Times poll, and 63 percent favored banning high-capacity magazines that hold many rounds of ammunition.\nWe found, in a 2011 survey we conducted for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, that 57 percent of Americans support a law that would limit the size of ammunition clips so that the gun could not fire more than 10 bullets without having to be reloaded. Only a third, or 34 percent, of Americans opposed that law.\nThe Brady Bill, which expired under President George W. Bush, and that Obama said he supported, regulated these kinds of assault weapons (AR-15). Those guns are now unregulated and the result is tragedy after tragedy that won’t end until elected leaders step up.\nSupport for sounder, safer gun laws is not restricted to blue states or big urban cities. In a study conducted by Lake Research Partners earlier this year in swing state-senate districts in Virginia, we found that two-thirds of voters (65 percent) in a rural western Virginia district believe the gun laws should be made stronger — including 52 percent who strongly believe so. Just 24 percent say they should be less restrictive.\nNinety-two percent of voters in a state senate district centered in Roanoke, Virginia, strongly endorsed requiring background checks for people purchasing guns and permits for people who want to carry a concealed loaded weapon.\nThe NRA and those who oppose gun safety measures should welcome a gun-control debate — especially if they think they have the winning hand.\nThe consistent lack of leadership on this issue is stunning. But what is most unnerving is that it does not have to be this way – the American people support common sense gun laws.\nOthers have said, even on Friday, that now is not the time to discuss more gun laws. They said this same thing after Aurora, after Portland, and now after Newtown. They are trying to silence the millions of Americans who want stronger protections from gun violence in their communities.\nThese silencers, led by the NRA, continue to use the 2011 Gallup poll, which we have already explained is problematic, to shut down the debate about new gun laws that will make us safer. That poll said that 43 percent of Americans support stricter gun laws, a 6 percentage point drop from 2008.\nBut as the numbers we have cited here show, this single Gallup question is too shallow to really tell the story of what Americans think about gun safety measures.\nNow is the time to have a discussion about gun laws that will make our communities and families safer. The American people are ready.\nObama showed great courage earlier this year when he stood up for the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry. His courage and leadership is needed here too. These tragedies will happen again and again until our leaders stand up and pass meaningful gun-safety laws that the American public supports.\nNo, the public doesn’t agree.\nThe majority of Americans support the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. This is a fact.\nThe public does not agree. The only reason there were so many deaths is because the federal ban on firearms within 100feet of a school does not permit a responsible citizen from carrying a firearm. Otherwise someone would have dropped this Perp in his tracks. The police and your gov’t can’t be everywhere and make you safe. Grow up and start taking responsibility for your own security. This article represents the psychology of the victim.\nThe Republicans need any and all fringe groups to make up for the fact that they represent a small percentage of the electorate.\nTheir greatest fear is that people will figure them out.\nWhich public is this that you speak of? The 26% as usual? Stop using tragedy to push your BS agendas.\nAlmost every Swiss man has an assault rifle and its ammunition, at home, as part of his obligation to do military service. Yet killings using these rifles are extremely rare. Why?\nThe two writers of this “opinion piece” (you noted, I didn’t call it news, nor refer to the authors as journalists), have managed to present about as much political drivel and spin as I’ve ever seen, in one single story. The vast majority of the article is composed of opinion, half truths, and highly targeted, and vague opinion “polls”. PULEEZE, can we get some real journalism here?\nA species that eats its young or fails to protect them becomes extinct. Think about it.\n@saildog07. You are clearly remarkably ignorant of what the US is, what we face as a people and what “inalienable rights” means.\nI think we should ban meth and heroin, that would keep it off the streets and, keep people from doing it.\nThe Colordao theater killer chose the only movie theater within 20 miles that had a ban on concealed weapons. You want the only people in the world to have guns to be governments and criminals? a naive concept.\nThis guy was insane – lets address the problems with mental illness and get some security at schools for God’s sake.\nFor the first time in my life, I am thinking about buying a gun.\nThe only places where these mass shootings have happened are where guns are not allowed. (Schools, churches, government buildings) These people maybe mentally ill but they still know enough to do this in places where someone can’t shoot back at them. Anyplace that does not allow legal gun owners to carry a firearm should be required to have an armed guard 24/7. Even then the armed guard won’t be in the right place at the right time. I would feel much safer sending my kids to the school in Texas with the Guardian program where some of the teachers are licensed to carry firearms. Outlaw firearms and only criminals will have them.\nThis is not what the public wants. This is what the liberals want for the public.\nI believe in gun control. I control mine very well. How about controlling the pez dispensing of mind altering, psychosis enducing drugs you’re giving people. Even dispensing these harmful drugs to young adults!\nIn the Supreme Court case, Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748 (2005), the court ruled that our local police are not responsible for protecting us. SOOOOOO, who IS responsible for protecting us? We are responsible. That’s why I responsibly conceal carry. I protect my wife and 2 small children. When more responsible people carry, violent crime goes down. The FBI crime statistics don’t lie. Why do the left and gun grabbing crowd ignore this fact? Liberalism is a mental disorder.\nLets look one poll that this particular article is using for it’s numbers.\nThe poll used 2 Senate Districts in the State of VA. District 21 and District 38.\nwith the total numbers of respondents being 305 voters in District 21 and 302 voters in district 38.\nThat’s a fairly small sample size considering Roanoke VA (part of district 21) has a population of 92,376 (2010 numbers) but polls being what they are they can’t call every registered voter.\nSo they are making a statement for the entire state of Virginia with a population of 8 million give or take from the words of 607 people. Now not all of the 8 million are old enough to vote or even care enough to vote. But the statement that such a small group of people are the norm for a much larger population is suspicious.\nLets now look at the generator of the poll and the authors of this piece. Lake Research here is a snippet from their web site.\nNothing unusual there, next check their “outstanding clients” I did not check all of them but the ones I did check are Democrats with a history of voting for more firearms laws or outright bans.\nSo going down to the list of causes that they have worked for I see several that catch my eye, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, MoveOn.org, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. So I think it is safe to say that this is a group that is defiantly not non-bias. Nothing wrong with that, but I would not trust this group to give me honest results any more than I would a Republican think tank on gay marriage.\nSo as to the title of this opinion piece states “Public agrees” there is not enough data in their source material to even make that assumption let alone any reason to believe that the authors are trying to give anything but their own viewpoints legitimacy.\nI think the founding fathers would have had a different opinion if they realized that modern “constitutionalists” were defending the right of 14 year old drug dealers to carry semiautomatic weapons or mentally deranged people to spray bullets into elementary school classrooms. The one part that is frequently lacking in these types of discussions is any realistic alternate solution or approach for stemming the regular occurrence of these types of events. Arming guards at the entrances to all schools? Really? Is that really the statement of our times? Ok, so we are the most heavily armed society in the world and we kill more fellow Americans every year than the combined total of the Gulf War, the Twin Towers assault, the Iraq war and the War on Terror in Afghanistan. Every year. Are there any serious suggestions of how to begin to address these murders?\nA gun is an inanimate tool not deviant behavior and crime is deviant behavior not an inanimate tool.\nYou can’t prevent deviant behavior by regulating tools because tools are incapable of behavior and the number of tools available to the world’s deviants is endless.\nEven if you could legislate guns out of existence, deviants could, would and have used other things that gave them a power advantage over their victims—knives, clubs, rocks or even sharp sticks—all of which are very legal and very accessible."

        "text": "James finished the preseason ranked tied for 14th in scoring (13.7 points per game) among league forwards.\nExhibition numbers mean little, or perhaps nothing, in the grand scheme of a season, but Bosh’s statistical effort during the preseason is anything but irrelevant — or random — when taken in the correct context. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spent the entire training camp drilling his players on the idea of a free-flowing, equal-opportunity offense. That Bosh, Mr. Random Guy, emerged from training camp as the team’s leading scorer means the Heat’s offense is healthy heading into the season opener against the Celtics on Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nMore often than not, Bosh is open on the offensive end. The ball found him during the preseason, and Bosh’s skills did the rest. He led the Heat in field-goal percentage (.551) while also leading the team in rebounds (43).\nJames is the driving force behind Spoelstra’s idea of “positionless basketball,” but Bosh might be the second-most important cog in the wheel. On most nights, Bosh is the quickest big man on the floor, and his consistent jump shot allows him to stretch defenses.\nConventional defensive strategy against the Heat calls for packing the paint to account for Wade and James. Entering his third season with the Heat, Bosh knows where to find the open spots on the periphery. He likes to call those opportunities random, but, when paired with James, the results are more like basketball jazz.\n“He’s open,” said James, who led the Heat with 41 assists in the preseason. “We’re playing with a lot more pace and a lot more space for him, and giving him a lot more opportunities to go at his matchup.\nWade credits Bosh’s big preseason to his work before training camp. Bosh skipped the Olympics to fully heal from the abdominal injury he sustained in the playoffs. Upon his return, he met with Wade and James and vowed to carry more of the load early in the season.\nWhen Bosh first arrived in Miami, the Heat wanted him to pack on muscle mass and bulk up for a life in the paint. Spoelstra scrapped that plan after the playoffs when the Heat used an unconventional lineup to win its second NBA championship. The Heat’s coach instructed Bosh to focus on his natural skill set: speed, quickness and shooting.\nBosh averaged 18.0 points per game last season, but Wade says Bosh is capable of “going for 20-plus a game and probably more effortlessly than” himself and James.\nWhile Bosh has accepted the label of center, offensively he’s more of a hybrid power forward than anything. The position of a traditional center is a dying art in the NBA, so much so that the league has removed the designation from All-Star ballots this season.\nFans will now vote for three “frontcourt players” and two guards rather than two guards, two forwards and a center. Despite the change, Bosh still doesn’t expect to garner any more votes for a starting spot.\n• The Heat finalized its 15-man roster on Saturday, cutting point guard Garrett Temple. Miami begins the season with 12 players from its championship team. Forward Rashard Lewis, forward Josh Harrellson and guard Ray Allen are the new additions."

        "text": "Paddling students is still legal in a third of the country. Kentucky legislators want to ban it.\nAs a 10th-grader in Jefferson County, Ky., Tina was caught cutting the lunch line. She would be disciplined, a school official told her, but he gave her a choice: detention or two “licks,” a sugarcoated term for two strikes with a wooden paddle.\nA male faculty member brought the teen, who was dressed in a cheerleading uniform, into an office and spanked her bottom with a paddle.\nTina Bojanowski’s memory was made more than 30 years ago, yet in a handful of states — including Kentucky — it seems the times have not changed, as the practice is still legal there. Now a member of the state legislature, Rep. Tina Bojanowski (D) is supporting a bill to prohibit corporal punishment.\n“When someone is doing something wrong, the most important thing is to change their behavior. There are more effective measures to change students’ behavior than striking them,” Riley, a former high school principal, told The Washington Post.\nThere’s been a national downward trend in corporal punishment in schools, according to research by Kids Count Data Center. In 2016, the Obama administration called for an end to the practice in all states and school districts. Thirty-one states have barred the practice, but 19 still permit it, Riley said.\nIn Kentucky, 17 school districts permit corporal punishment. According to research done by the Kids Count Data Center, during the 2017-2018 academic year, there were 452 reported instances of such punishment in the state.\nOf those 17 districts, five accounted for 85 percent of cases. Bell County reported 129 incidents, the highest in Kentucky for the academic year. Clinton County, the second highest, reported 128 incidents, a figure more than seven times the 17 incidents reported during 2016-17. Neither county schools superintendent responded to The Post for comment.\nPulaski and Harlan counties reported increases in instances of corporal punishment, to 67 and 30 cases, respectively.\nRiley presented the legislation to the state House Education Committee earlier in February, but the bill was not voted on. Similar bills were also introduced in 2017 and 2018 but not passed.\nThe Kentucky school districts that permit paddling are predominantly in rural areas, according to Riley. Their legislators who oppose the bill argue they want to protect against government overreach. “They say that discipline should be left to local school board, not state government,” Riley said.\nWith eight days left in the legislative session, Riley said, H.B. 202 is unlikely to be voted on imminently. But, he added, “I’m going to keep proposing until it gets passed.\""

        "text": "Lookout Landing jots down a few thoughts on Shoppach as only they can. Marc W over at USS Mariner take s a look at catching defense and trying to measure it.\nFor me, there aren't many ways to statistically measure catching defense. And of those ways -- throwing out runners, passed balls (don't you ever use catcher's ERA, ever) - that's about 1/10th of the responsibilities of the position. And because of that, any stat - namely Win Above Replacement player (WAR) - that uses a defensive metric is kind of flawed when it comes to catchers. So much of a catcher's responsibility cannot be measured or quantified with numbers. I was converted to catcher in college (ate my way out of second base), and played the position for three years. The amount of things that went into just one game were overwhelming - and that was at the NAIA level. So at the big league level? It's ridiculous. It's why I kind of just shrugged my shoulders on WAR comparisons of John Jaso and Mike Morse.\nOne thing that would be interesting is the 40-man roster move the Mariners would make if they sign Shoppach. Who do they designate for assignment? Would it be another young player like Yoervis Medina, or would the Mariners part ways with Mike Carp, who seems to have no place on the team.\nAs for other free agents..... outfielder Michael Bourn met with the Mets (see what I did there?). If you notice in the Sherman story, he views it as a long shot. Why? Well according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, Bourn's agent - Scott Boras - wants 5-years at $15 million per year. And if anyone knows what Boras wants, it would be Heyman.\nFrom what I've been told, there hasn't been a ton of discussion about Bourn in the Mariners' front office. I'm guessing the idea of $75 million is a little too much of a commitment, particularly with their push to sign Felix Hernandez to a contract extension. Of course, that could change if the asking price went down a little. But how often does Boras' asking price go down? Would Bourn help the Mariners? Yes. He would give them a legitimate lead-off hitter that they don't have and another defensive presence in the outfield. Having Bourn and Gutierrez in the same outfield could offset any defensive issues in left field. But I'd be surprised if they go this route. And it's not because they are worried about giving up their first round pick (No. 12 overall) as compensation.\nThe Mariners are still hoping to add a veteran pitcher as well. Joe Saunders' name has been mentioned outside sources, but it doesn't sound like the team is interested in overpaying. Lohse's asking price is also way too high for his value..... here's a list of other pitchers that are unsigned. Any names that interest you?"

The foundation will receive the naming rights for the facility.\n“We just recently finished the scope, so now we know the how many beds and what the kinds of services will be,” Hoffman said.\nThe centre will include 101 inpatient beds, child and adolescent crisis services, a mobile response team and a slew of other services including outpatient support.\nThe centre will be built on land owned by Alberta Health Services east of the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital.\nThe foundation plans to raise the additional funds over the next five years, he added.\nConstruction is set to begin in spring 2021, with completion slated for 2024.

The party doesn&apos;t allow free media, and fears criticism or discussion of its failings on the Internet could lead to social instability and — ultimately — loss of its power.\n\"Nobody can shut our mouth or stop our freedom of expression,\" said a member of the team that administers one of the targeted blogs, Danlambao. \"This is our mission. We will continue at any cost.\" The blogger chatted over the Internet with The Associated Press on the condition that his name and exact location not be published because of the risk of arrest.\nDanlambao, or \"Citizens&apos; Journalism,\" is one of the most prominent of several dissident blogs that have sprung up in the last two years.\nIt has attracted thousands of viewers in recent weeks because of its reporting on suspected power struggles among the ruling elite that it says may have been behind the arrest of a banking tycoon last month. It has speculated that the detention of Nguyen Duc Kien, said to be close to the prime minister&apos;s daughter, was the result of tensions between the premier and the president.\nLate Wednesday, the government said Danlambao and two others sites had been \"publishing distorted and fabricated articles\" against the leadership. It said that Vietnamese state employees were forbidden from visiting the sites.\nIt is not illegal for Vietnamese to visit the targeted sites, but they are blocked by the government&apos;s firewall. Vietnam blocks many sensitive websites, though the firewall is fairly easy to get around.\n\"This is a wicked plot of the hostile forces,\" a government statement said, adding that the prime minister had ordered police to arrest those associated with the sites.\nThe statement led to a surge in visitors to the sites as curious Vietnamese wanted to see what they had been publishing, according to the blogs.\nThe Danlambao blog said it was on course to have more than 500,000 page views Thursday, more than double its normal amount, thanks to what it called the unintended public relations coup handed to it by the government.\nOne of the other targeted sites, Quanlambao, or the \"Officials&apos; Journalism\" blog, said Dung&apos;s threat was meant to lay the legal groundwork for a campaign of arrests against bloggers.\nThe blogger contacted by The AP said Dung mentioned their site by name to try to scare contributors from contacting it.\n\"They (the government) are losing control of the independent blogs,\" the blogger said. \"Not just our one.\"\nThe blogger said Danlambao&apos;s sources of information were other bloggers, journalists who work for state-run media, ordinary citizens and Communist Party members seeking to damage other factions within the party. Some of the material comes from reading between the lines of reports in the state-run media, the blogger said.\n\"They provide us the bullets and we shoot — because they can&apos;t,\" the blogger said.\nInternational watchdog Reporters Without Borders says there are currently at least five journalists and 19 bloggers being held on various charges in Vietnam, part of a gathering government effort to stifle criticism over the last two years even as the country presses ahead with opening its economy to foreign investment. The government labels democracy and free speech activists as terrorists.\nJournalists working for foreign news organization are allowed to live in the country but must ask permission to report outside the capital. That is routinely denied if the subject of the story is seen as sensitive or damaging to Vietnam."

However, it seemed that in a bid to absolve itself from the blunder and the chaotic situation, the SLR kept on stating that they are hoping to send the team but it never materialized.\nWhat was really baffling was the comment made to the media by one of the top ranked SLR officials, where he said: “When it comes to such high profile tournaments, the Ministry of Sports is funding only the teams which have clear opportunity to secure a medal.” Such a statement, it appears gives the impression that SLR was under-prepared.\nThe Women’s Tuskers did reasonably well in the Asian 7’s circuit in 2017 just a few months prior to the Asian Games under the watchful eyes of Sudath Sampath (Head Coach), Inthie Marikkar (Director, High Performance), and Dilan Zoysa (Trainer). Going by some of their performances of this tournament especially of Sri Lanka’s losing margins to Hong Kong (5-10) and Kazakstan (0-12); and the fact that Sri Lanka beat Thailand (24-12 to win the Plate championship) who incidentally lost the bronze medal to Kazakhstan at Asian Games speaks volumes of Sri Lanka’s bright chances. While Japan won the Gold, the Silver went to China. So the top four teams at the Asian Games finally stand as Japan, China, Kazakstan and Thailand. Where would Sri Lanka been placed had they participated?\nIt is indeed a very sad state of affairs why the SLR officials just could not do their home work to come out with a sound assessment. Surely, the authorities who are top administrators in their own rights (may not necessarily be well conversant in sports) would have possibly understood the prospect of a medal on a general analytical perspective. How on earth did the Sri Lanka hockey administrators able to convince the authorities to field a men’s team and got humiliated by India 20 goals to nil at the Asian Games. In that context, the SLR surely had all the rights to impress the authorities. Where did the think-tanks of SLR go wrong? The rugby fraternity’s only hope would be to see that SLR conducts its affairs more sensibly in the future.\nFurthermore what’s really shocking was that 180 athletes and nearly 70 odd officials amounting to a total of approximately 250 people had participated at this year’s Asian Games representing Sri Lanka while depriving the prospect medalists, the women Tuskers. In the overall assessment, it was the 4 x 400 men’s relay team and Men’s 7’s rugby team did perform well to secure fourth place. We wish to reserve the comments on the performance of the men’s rugby team."

Millennials received this info gratefully; finally, a thing we were not responsible for, an errand we did not actually have to do. Unfortunately, this is wrong; in fact, everyone should get the flu shot.\nLast year’s flu season was the worst in a decade, worse than the year of swine flu. Over 80,000 people died. There are many factors at work, but a big one that medical professionals attributed to the unusually high rate of deaths and infections was a drop in the rate of adults who bothered to get their shot — yes, those same people between the ages of 18 and 65 who “don’t need” it.\nTo think about vaccines as they affect each person individually is blinkered; sure, you don’t want to get sick, but more than vaccines prevent individual illness, they prevent illnesses from spreading. We see this already with children in locations where it’s trendy among parents to simply not get their kids vaccinated from preventable diseases like measles out of irrational fears; because of those parents, those diseases spread faster and people die more frequently. Epidemics happen because of new, wild, aggressive disease strains, but they also happen for lack of prevention. More to the point, just because you can afford to miss work or buy medication when you get sick doesn’t mean others can.\nIn the same way you don’t not vote because nothing is bothering you specifically, you don’t not get the flu shot because you are very likely to survive it yourself. This is how social contracts work: How a collective action impacts you personally is maybe the least important thing, especially if you are in the most privileged group. Please get your flu shot."

Opara says he isn't quite so sure.\nBut a long injury history — and a look toward life after soccer — made it more than just a hasty reaction. He played only three games in 2014 before suffering a rare chondral defect in his right ankle.\n\"I've been through a lot with all the other injuries,\" he said. \"I wanted to be healthy for my life.\n\"And I felt like I couldn't catch a break. It was like, this again? I just wondered if it would be worth it to go through all that all over again.\"\nOpara spoke with his family and friends. He told them he was contemplating retirement — only two months after his 26th birthday and only days after national experts put him in the conversation for Major League Soccer's best defender.\nThen? A change of heart.\nIt came slowly. After undergoing a minimally-invasive surgery — a recently-developed procedure designed to expedite his return to the field — Opara learned his season wasn't over just yet. Doctors allowed for the possibility of a 2015 return. Maybe.\nA possibility is all he needed. He began rehab in the following weeks. The pain subsided more quickly than he expected. He regained the urge to join his teammates back on the field.\nAnd that's looking more and more likely by the day. Opara has returned to Sporting Kansas City practice, at least for the non-contact drills, with an eye toward returning to the field this season. His coach, Peter Vermes, expects it to happen — whether it be before the regular season concludes on Oct. 25 or sometime during the playoffs.\n\"That's always been the goal (since the diagnosis),\" Opara said. \"Obviously the way I've been progressing, for now, why not try to push and see where it goes? If we keep doing well as a team and hopefully make the playoffs and make a deep run, I see no reason why I wouldn't be available for that.\"\nThere are still hurdles to cross, of course. While Opara says his lateral movement is \"just as good, if not better\" than it was prior to the Achilles' tendon rupture, the linear movements are still a work in progress. He is noted for his athleticism — which makes him a dangerous aerial weapon — but his jumping ability hasn't fully returned yet.\nThere are signs it's close.\n\"Ike was in an exercise the other day. If you would've come out here and you didn't know the team, and I (told) you to pick that guy that you think is injured out there, you would never pick him,\" Vermes said. \"I can tell you that.\"\nEven so, Opara isn't near 90-minutes fit. And central defender isn't a typical spot for a mid-gme substitution, though Vermes hinted at an exception.\n\"One of the things you can do with Ike is bring him on late in the game, and he can be an extra guy for aerial duels and things like that,\" Vermes said. \"He has value in that respect.\"\nIt's an exciting possibility — and a potentially significant one for a Sporting KC team in need of an added aerial threat on offensive set pieces.\n\"I don't know what my future holds. I'm just taking it day-by-day,\" Opara said. \"But it looks a lot better than it did a few months ago. I know that.\""

Rams. That’s the first game on January 20.\nThen, in the AFC Championship, the Patriots travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs.\nOnline bookie agents must prepare for the huge amounts of action that should land in their sportsbooks before the 2019 NFL Conference Championships.\nCheck out how they’ll do just that using PayPerHead’s Prime Package tools.\nSaints versus Rams could be one of those nail biters, or, it could end up a Saints blowout win.\nObviously, New Orleans was rusty in the first quarter of their 20-14 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Saints came back after being down 14-0.\nNew Orleans should control the clock, as they did with the close to 12 minute drive in the third quarter versus Philadelphia, meaning many pay per head agents might not use their layoff accounts on the total.\nMany will also allow money on the Rams to ride if the Rams are over bet. Just in case, bookmakers will set max betting limits on both moneylines.\nThe New England Patriots are in a strange position on Sunday.\nThe Pats must beat the Chiefs on the road to stamp their ticket to Super Bowl 53. New England has been masterful for close to a decade.\nSunday’s AFC Championship will be New England’s eighth straight.\nLess than 50% of NFL handicappers believe the Patriots cover the spread. Many are pounding the Chiefs.\nSome pay per head agents will try and score big profits by allowing money to ride on the Chiefs and not use their layoff accounts.\nIf the Chiefs don’t cover the spread, those bookies who take that risk could make out big time.\nMost all bookie agents will set max betting limits on both the Patriots and Chiefs. The odds are low enough to where some players will bet massive amounts on both sides.\nKeep that in mind when deciding whether to back a team against the spread or on the moneyline.\nJust as quickly as the 2019 NFL Conference Championship games approached, so to will Super Bowl 53. Each year the Super Bowl brings in over $4 BILLION worth of wagers, over 97% of wagers are placed through off-shore sportsbooks and individual bookmakers.\nDon’t miss out on that $4 billion dollar pie. Become a bookmaker before February 3rd! Sign up for PayPerHead’s Prime Package today to get a 3-week trial at just $3 per head.\nSpeak to a rep today and start cashing-in on Super Bowl 53."

The cutouts and big modular panels give the place a contemporary feel, while the red-brick construction recalls the neighborhood’s traditional housing.\nThe development (at 33rd Street and South Parnell Avenue) also positions every unit to take advantage of the two best local views: the fireworks over U.S. Cellular Field and the city skyline. Each of the 11 units has one upper-floor terrace looking south and another looking north. “You’re never going to want to go inside all summer,” says Jennifer Liu, an Atland Realty agent selling units in the building.\nThe spaces inside are roomy and bathed in light from a two-story gridwork of windows; in most of them, an overlook from one floor to another also helps light reach the lower level. At presstime, three units remained at 33rd Street Square, all ready for occupancy. The lowest-cost unit is a 2,800-square-foot three-bedroom unit priced at $559,000; at the upper end, a 3,400-square-foot corner unit with dramatic cutouts and light wells is priced at $675,000."

        "text": "Let’s try again: what happened to the stock market yesterday? We still don’t know, but it appears that something concrete happened against the background of a market that was already tripwire nervous over Greece and the euro and China and whatnot.\nConsidering that the giant decline happened on pretty much *no* volume, I think other factors are at work. I believe the core problem here was a real order imbalance with lots of volume (which took us down the original 350), then nyse halts these stocks, the market orders get rereouted (regnms and all) to ECN’s where there is much less liquidity, and what liquidity is normally there is mostly provided by the nefarious HF strats who were rightly scaling back risk. So the 10K shares that might have been a downtick on nyse blows throught the BATS book completely.\nIn English, this means that when trading started to get too hot and heavy, the New York Stock Exchange stepped in to slow things down. In the old days, this would have worked, but not anymore. Most trading of NYSE stocks doesn’t actually happen on the NYSE anymore, it happens on electronic communication networks (ECNs) like BATS in Kansas City, which is the third-largest stock exchange in the world. So what the algo guy is saying is that when the NYSE tried to slow things down, the computers responsible for program trading just switched their orders over to ECNs. Unfortunately, ECNs are largely used by high-frequency trading shops, and the HFT guys closed up when the market went kablooey. So the ECNs had no buyers, and even a small sell order could blow the doors off a stock price. Which it did.\nI’m very much in favor of this. Maybe someday we’ll understand all this stuff well enough to control it, but right now we don’t seem to. Our financial system really needs a little bit of sand in the gears to bring it back down to human speeds. This would be a good way to do it, and would probably have other benefits too (quite aside from the money it raises). Count me as a fan."

        "text": "KARACHI: Driving up to Landhi you reach an area on the rather bumpy Mehran Highway where pick-ups and lorries number more than the other vehicles. Those coming in are empty but the ones driving out are loaded with dozens of silver milk canisters. Well, of course, why wouldn’t they be? After all, this is Bhains Colony, the place the entire city gets its milk from.\nYou can pick up some moos coming from various directions. But there are hardly any cattle roaming about freely here or there. That’s because they are all doing the work inside the dairy farms on either side of the road. The animals there eat and drink all day to stay healthy and be able to produce lots and lots of good quality milk.\n“We milk our buffaloes twice in 24 hours — at 4am and 4pm,” says Imtiaz Ahmed, one of the staff supervisors at Shaukat Mukhtar Farms. There are some 450 buffaloes at the farm and almost all are lined up to enjoy their feed as the men milk them manually by hand.\n“Eating keeps them busy. So as they munch on their feed they stay in one place for us to be able to milk them,” he says. To ensure that the dairy workers don’t get kicked in the face by the buffaloes, they also lightly tie up their hind legs while milking them.\nAsked why they don’t have pumps for milking, he explains that there are pumps too at several dairy farms in Bhains Colony, but at their farms they prefer to milk by hand. “Usually, we use pumps to milk cows, not buffaloes. Cows give more milk, too. Pumps are good for milking in quantity. But cows’ milk is thin while buffalo milk is thicker and richer,” he explains.\nThe feed the animals eat has been specially designed and is highly nutritious to help them produce more milk. “It contains wheat, porridge, lentils, mustard, spinach greens, Malaysian palm oil, corn, ghee, etc,” he says.\nThe dairy workers with stainless steel buckets and metal canisters bring over the milk they collect to pour into big metal tubs placed at various points. “Fresh milk is warm. Keeping it in big tubs helps it to cool slightly before sending it off to the market,” shares Aslam Malik, another staff member at the farm. And he adds that the milk better reach the milk shops in a couple of hours otherwise it can go bad.\n“The shops have chillers and refrigerators to store it properly but we here only concentrate on the production part of it,” he says, adding that the milk is absolutely pure at this point. “Forty litres of milk carries about 4kg of cream,” he says gesturing to the layer of cream floating on top of the milk in the tubs. “But once this milk leaves this place, it will be tampered with and diluted according to the conscience of the people who are into this kind of dishonesty,” he says.\nThe milk is sold for Rs70 per litre at the dairy farms and in the shops it is sold for Rs80 or 85 a litre.\n“The price was only increased earlier this month from the previous rate of Rs66 per litre,” he says.\nThe dairy farmers say that everyone should have fresh milk instead of the packaged variety. “What you get in the name of milk in a box is something devoid of the healthy fats, cream and nutrition. It is processed milk where they have taken away the fat for making side products such as cheese, butter, ghee, yogurt, lassi, etc,” says Malik.\nThe dairy farmers buy new cattle every month to replace the ones that have finished their milking cycle and are considered spent. These could then be sent off to the slaughterhouse or to a farm where they can take a short break before insemination and parturition before lactating again.\nThe best cattle, the farmers say, are from Badin in Sindh and from the Ravi area in Punjab. These may cost between Rs160,000 to Rs200,000. They also have foreign cows and buffaloes such as the black and white ones from Australia, which are known for producing more milk than the local varieties, but these are very expensive and delicate so they require more care."

Unfortunately, the hiker seduced to our west coast by such a photo can be in for a disappointment!\nAnd so it was for us in mid-August in Glencolumbkille: a moist warm sector airstream had narrowed our world to a 200m deep slot between grey sea and grey sky. Within this space, as we drove to our start point in Glencolumbkille and to our carsplit finish in Port, mists rose and fell over wet hedges and heather, all seeming to make for an unattractive hiking prospect.\nExcept that, just north of the Napoleonic Watchtower on Glen Head, we quite unexpectedly happened upon an utterly beautiful world that had our heads and hearts reeling. Why was that, we asked ourselves? Well, the beauty that came to us that day on that wonderfully wild and ragged coastline, between the low grey sky and a swirling, noisy sea of dramatic white and sky-grey, was not “picture postcard perfect”, but magical in its ever-changing, elemental play of cloud, sound, sea and rock. And it brought home to us the wonder of the shore and sea, especially our Atlantic Ocean, as walking companions or backdrop in all but the very worst of conditions.\nThis is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it’s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen. We started at Biofán, about 1.5km from Glencolumbkille, and progressed in low mood and mist to the signal tower just north of Glen Head. Soon we were in from under the curtain of mist, with truly awe-inspiring Sturrall pitched before us. Easy cropped grass underfoot allowed us safely to admire this shattered quartzite sea arête, with its fresh and ancient scars of battle with the wildest of Atlantic storms. Below and around it were surf-girdled sea-stack remnants, some undercut into dramatic sea arches. Wraiths of mist rolled up its windward flank, obscuring the sea but seemingly accentuating its sound - a great place to stop for lunch and to appreciate the immense privilege of just being there.\nSoon great stream-cut ravines interrupted the route, forcing encircling swings inland or aerobic descents and ascents, until the wild shore of Port came into view. By now for us, the mist had thickened, adding even more to the age-old elemental “feel” of the place.\nWe meandered carefully the indentations of the coast, staying inside a restraining ditch and fence, joined the marked trail to our car in Port and stood beside the memorial to the 19 crew members lost on the “Sydney” in November 1870. Meanwhile, the arriving rain and enshrouding mist, and thoughts of the terror of the sea as well as its beauty, added a sombre note to the end of our hike!\nSuitability: easy to moderate, care needed on off-trail sections near cliff edges, especially in windy weather."

        "text": "It’s been nearly five years to the day that Ashley Smith made the 9-1-1 call leading to Brian Nichols’ surrender.\nThe story of the seven hours preceding that March 12, 2005, phone call seemed almost impossible to swallow: a polite, soft-spoken waitress from Augusta gets inside the mind of a man fresh off a killing spree, gains his trust, makes him pancakes, stays alive and gets free.\nEditor's Note: This article was published in 2010, five years after the Fulton County Courthouse shootings. In 2015, the 10th anniversary of the shootings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is taking another look at the case of Brian Nichols and the events around that violent day. 2015 Coverage: Brian Nichols shootings 10 years later.\nShe recounted the events of the night Nichols forced his way into her home on television two days later, and the nation saw the same calm demeanor and steady blue eyes that had soothed Nichols as he showered, ate, watched television and did his laundry after murdering four people. Days later when she returned to the scene, she discovered that in the time after he let her go and before the authorities arrived, he’d hung a mirror she’d been meaning to put up in her new apartment.\nToday, Ashley Smith Robinson – she married Daniel Robinson in June 2007 – says that was “the one event that really changed my life.” She earns a living from speaking engagements, mainly before religious groups, retelling her ordeal and the self-transformation that followed.\nShe’s also on track to complete the radiologic technology program at Lanier Tech in September. She someday hopes to do ultrasounds.\nBut people will always know her for the poise under pressure that led to the media moniker, the Atlanta Hostage Hero.\nSix months after the public first marveled at the details of March 12, with its bizarrely squeaky-clean images of scrambled eggs and the pair huddled over Rick Warren’s “The Purpose Driven Life,” a second wave of news stories added a different veneer. Smith Robinson’s book about the ordeal, “Unlikely Angel,” revealed she’d given Nichols a few lines of methamphetamine to snort from her stash.\nWhen Nichols pulled a gun on her outside Bridgewater Apartments in Duluth, Smith Robinson was trying to get her life back on track, kick meth and get a career going to prove to her family she was capable of being a mother.\nThe book showed that this pretty blond Georgia girl had a dark side of her own, a well she drew from to elicit compassion from Nichols. She writes about a past that includes drug-induced psychotic visions, hospitalization, sending her daughter, Paige, away to be raised by an aunt so she could have more time to party, and holding her first husband, Paige's father, in her arms as he died from a knife wound after a violent fight in a parking lot in 2001.\nBut that was then. Paige, 10, now lives with her mom, and Smith Robinson’s post-Brian Nichols life seems safe and successful. She coaches Paige’s basketball team, has learned to Scuba dive, runs marathons, attends classes and is active in her church.\nUntil now, she's spurned offers to make a movie about her life. But she’s recently OK’d preliminary plans with “Amazing Grace” producer Ken Wales to make a Christian-themed movie about the event. She’s not sure when it would be released.\nNichols himself predicted the windfall of positive change that would grow out of her time with him. She writes in her book that just before he let her go he said, “Everybody’s going to praise you and talk about how wonderful you are.” Soon after, Nichols surrendered peacefully in front of Ashley’s apartment and admitted his crimes.\nSmith Robinson immediately left Atlanta at that time and sought shelter with her aunt and uncle at their house in a gated community near Augusta.\n“It was very important that I went from one extreme to the other after that happened,” she said. Her aunt, Kim Rogers, who had been raising Paige for the past three years, walked her through it all.\nWhen Smith Robinson talks about the night with Nichols, she says it was God, not her, who made the psychological maneuvers to relate to his outrage. On March 14, 2005, when she apologized on his behalf, she seemed in the odd position of serving as a bridge between the killer and his victims. She’s since been in contact with immediate family members of all the victims, save one.\nShe’s not sure yet if she'll ever have further contact with Nichols. She said she couldn’t look at him during the five and a half hours she spent repeating the facts in the 2008 trial that led to his imprisonment with no chance of parole.\n“From day one, I always said, ‘God, if you want me to have anymore contact with this person whatsoever, I need for you to lay it heavy on my heart.' For a very long time, I haven’t felt that. Recently, I’ve felt like maybe I’m supposed to write a letter, but I need to be sure this is God talking and not something else.\n\"I don’t know what that letter would say. The only thing that comes to mind is that when we were talking, he asked me what his purpose in life was. I told him maybe it was to minister to people in prison. I think that’s one thing I would write: What are you doing with your life? I’ve made something positive out of mine. What are you doing with yours?\""

The BBC reports this, and so does Al Jazeera.\n“We are in constant contact with local and national authorities to ensure everything is done to protect them,” both ministers said.\nSo, these are not cheap words, or political posturing. Something is actually being done.\nBravo, France! You are a secular republic that sees, in true secular fashion, the human needs of people in distress, and wants to do something about it.\nBravo, France! You have form in this matter already. For France it was that received thousands of refugees from Russia in the aftermath of the revolution there, and also took in thousands of Armenians who survived the Ottoman genocide of 1915. Now, once more, you are helping those who need a safe haven.\nBravo, France! You have expressed outrage at the treatment of the Christians of Mosul, and you have not taken the line that these are merely one oppressed group among many: there has been no ‘universalise to minimise’ strategy here.\nItaly and the Vatican acted over the case of Meriam Ibrahim; France is now prepared to act over the persecuted Christians of Mosul. (Entry to France may well give them entry to the entire European Union.) Over to you, David Cameron and William Hague."

        "text": "Archives|Is Mr. Gorbachev Turning Tail?\nJust who is Mikhail Gorbachev? The reformer whose unconventional thinking encourages the Soviet Union to transform itself, or a pushover for reac tionaries who want him to arrogate authority and save the Union at all costs? Americans have reason to wonder, and cause for concern. But they'd be wrong to ignore the continuing revolution in Soviet society amid the moment's political machinations.\nSoviet reformers are themselves uncertain of what to make of Mr. Gorbachev's increasingly conservative behavior. Sensing a mood swing in Moscow, some actually applaud his efforts to restore order. Their hope is that he will thus tame the tiger of reaction and consolidate reform before renewing it. Others, like the most reform-minded of his inner circle, Eduard Shevardnadze and Aleksandr Yakovlev, warn of impending dictatorship. Yet even they have warm words for him.\nMr. Gorbachev's reformist critics fall into two camps. One is composed of radicals who favor the breakup of the Soviet Union. They, along with those who cheer them on from outside, call for Mr. Gorbachev's overthrow. But they've always underestimated his radicalism and his perseverance, while overestimating their own support.\nThe other camp consists of reformers who have grown disenchanted with the pace of change. They fear that he has been co-opted by apparatchiks who identify freer speech and markets with chaos.\nBut these critics do not include Mr. Shevardnadze or Mr. Yakovlev. The real enemy, they still say, is not Mr. Gorbachev but the forces of reaction deeply entrenched in Moscow's ministries, the security forces, Communist Party apparatus and regional military commands.\n\"We are witnessing the rise of a vengeful and merciless conservative wave,\" Mr. Yakovlev said last week. \"I'm extremely worried by the indifference and fatigue of the democratic forces.\"\nNow both he and Mr. Shevardnadze are on the outside looking in. And both may have lost power on what is now the central issue confronting Mr. Gorbachev -- how to reconstitute the Union.\nBoth men favor decentralization to allow reformers in the Russian Republic to plunge ahead, while republics in Central Asia proceed more slowly. And they want to cede more power to the republics as a way for leaders who favor the Union to head off independence movements. The exceptions are the Baltic republics; Mr. Yakovlev admits that they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, implying they eventually deserve independence.\nSuch fine distinctions seem to be lost on Mr. Gorbachev just now. The immediate task, as he sees it, is to restore order. And to do so he has turned to the bureaucracy, the military and the K.G.B.\nThe great fear -- not only in Moscow but also in Washington -- is that Mr. Gorbachev's alliance of convenience will restore the reactionaries and torpedo reform. That could happen.\nBut the social revolution has moved too far for any lasting return to the days of Stalin, or even Brezhnev. No longer a peasant society, the Soviet Union is increasingly urban, educated and cosmopolitan. Mr. Gorbachev knows all that, and more: he knows that technological accomplishment cannot proceed without freer discussion and that social renewal cannot come without relaxing central command. For now, and as long as the transformation of the Soviet Union continues, it still warrants America's watchful encouragement."

Ryan Flaherty reports.\nThe National Lacrosse League (NLL) announced Thursday it reluctantly has no choice but to cancel the first two weekends of the 2018-19 season due to a labour dispute with its players.\nNLL has been negotiating with the Professional Lacrosse Players’ Association (PLPA) — the exclusive bargaining agent for players — and a collective bargaining agreement has not been reached.\nLeague officials said the PLPA has instructed its players not to attend training camps or submit to physicals.

There is only one moral answer, and that is to end our support for their intervention in Yemen,\" Khanna said on Twitter.\nThe coalition supports the internationally recognized government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, which is fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels who seized control of Sanaa in 2014.\nUS Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a separate statement endorsing the certification, saying the UAE and Saudis are making \"every effort\" to reduce the risk of civilian casualties and collateral damage.\nMattis last month warned that US support for the coalition was \"not unconditional,\" noting that the coalition must do \"everything humanly possible to avoid any innocent loss of life.\"\nPompeo said Washington would work closely with the coalition to ensure Saudi and UAE support for UN peace efforts and to allow unimpeded access for commercial and humanitarian relief supplies to reach Yemenis.\n\"The Trump administration has been clear that ending the conflict in Yemen is a national security priority,\" Pompeo said.\nLong-awaited, UN-brokered peace talks between the Saudi-backed government and the Huthi rebels failed to take place as planned last week in Geneva.\nThe Huthis said the UN had failed to guarantee the safe return of their delegation from Geneva to Sanaa and to secure the evacuation of wounded rebels to Oman."

        "text": "He was in the airline business. He was American. And he knew his golf.\nYou know, he said, the American golfer who makes a first foray across the Atlantic typically goes to Scotland first.\nThen the golfer goes to Ireland.\nThis, of course, begged the question: why?\nI’ll attempt to answer, but first an admission.\nI am biased because I am from Ireland and much of my youth was spent of golf courses there, one in particular, where my dad and other family members enjoyed membership.\nThat said, I am also objective enough to know that in writing about Ireland as one of the planet’s prime golf destinations I am on very firm ground indeed, anything but a voice in the wilderness, or the rough.\nAnd here’s another thing. I have played the game all over the United States and that includes Hawaii.\nI have walked the walk at the likes of Augusta National and Pinehurst. I have cast an admiring eye over Pebble Beach.\nAnd yet I still close my eyes and imagine a fair Irish day on a green Irish fairway.\nI also imagine better shots than I’m capable of hitting, but that’s another story.\nAt the end of this homage to Irish golf - being penned just days before the U.S. Open in a place called Erin Hills (Wisconsin) no less - I will repeat what has been said to me by more than one American golfer, this with regard to where arguably the most spectacular golf course on planet earth can be found.\nIt’s an Irish course…of course.\nAnd, yes, this is a subjective point of view. It’s really impossible to rate a course as being “best” in the world. But “spectacular” leaves a little more wiggle room.\nAnd, as stated, the affirming with regard to this particular course opinion has been directed at yours truly more than once.\nI have not played this course, but have played a fair few other Irish courses that certainly rate in global terms.\nSo let’s take a little trip around the island and name a few.\nFirst up though, it’s important to note that golf, along with a number of other sports, is an all island affair in terms of governance.\nThere is no border in Irish golf.\nThis fact led to all the ballyhoo a while back regarding Rory McIlroy and whether he would represent Ireland or Great Britain in the Olympics.\nHe didn’t play in the games, but had he done so it would have been for Ireland.\nRory is a pivotal figure in Irish golf in more ways than one.\nHis foundation is a prime sponsor of the Irish Open, this year being played in Portstewart, County Derry in early July.\nMcIlroy’s success in golf majors, along with that of Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, both from Northern Ireland, has been instrumental in the decision to bring The Open to Royal Portrush, just down the road from Portstewart, in 2019.\nPadraig Harrington’s name being twice inscribed on the Claret Jug is also a factor.\nThis return of The Open to the Antrim coast draws a link back to 1951 when the oldest of golf’s majors was played there and won by Max Faulkner, a player remembered for his preference for plus fours instead of golfing slacks.\nFaulkner was a standout in more ways than just dress.\nThe story has it that after three rounds through the rolling Portrush dunes, Faulkner was signing autographs that already proclaimed himself as the winner of the tournament.\nTrue, he was six shots up after 54 holes but stranger things have happened. In this case they didn’t.\nI met Max Faulkner when I was a kid.\nHe was playing at that course where I spent so much of my youth, Woodbrook, which straddles the line between Dublin and Wicklow.\nI remember those odd looking plus fours. Faulkner was also a nice guy, or at least a tolerant one as he was being buzzed by whippersnappers like myself eager for player monikers.\nRoyal Portrush and Portstewart rate highly then.\nAnd in Ulster there’s another brace to add to the list of must-plays. Royal County Down for sure, and I have fond memories of a nice stroll around Rosapenna links in County Donegal, a place where you could tee off on the eighteenth at 10.30 on a midsummer’s night and, assuming no diversions into the rough, finish in a manageable gloaming.\nBeing an island, Ireland has an abundance of links courses but also some truly beautiful parkland venues.\nThe K Club in Kildare and Mount Juliet in Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny come to mind.\nIn the case of the latter, there is a claim that this is the best parkland course on the island. Well, it was designed by Jack Nicklaus so that’s an argument that would be difficult to refute.\nDruid’s Glen in County Wicklow is definitely worth a visit. Killarney, which I have battled my way around, is for sure another as is Adare Manor in County Limerick.\nThe aforementioned Woodbrook, which hosted a number of Ireland’s top tournaments in the 1960s and 1970s, is beside the Irish Sea but is rated a parkland course because it is fronted by mud cliffs.\nThe wind has had its wicked way with some of the course trees, not least pines that end up leaning this way and that.\nSometimes, with a quick glance at certain corners of the course, you would actually be reminded a little of Pebble Beach.\nIt is probably fair to say that the American golfer, when thinking in terms of an Irish foray, first and foremost considers a links.\nNo shortage of those of course. From those northern bastions mentioned above come on down the coast stopping at Rosses Point in County Sligo, Lahinch in Clare and also in the Banner County, Doonbeg and its mountainous dunes.\nDoonbeg has Greg Norman’s name on the designer credits. He is reputed to have turned up, cast an eye over the landscape only to proclaim that there was nothing he could do here that God had not already done.\nHaving played Doonbeg, I would confidently second that assertion.\nHaving played it in a fresh Atlantic wind I would throw in the devil himself for good measure.\nDown the coast a bit there is mighty, and mighty famous, Ballybunion with that opening tee shot that invites you to land your ball in a cemetery.\nA fitting metaphor for my game so when I stood on the tee I made sure that I aimed well left of the headstones.\nWaterville in County Kerry is another course to tackle. This was the late great Payne Stewart’s home from home. He used to tend bar in the clubhouse and was proclaimed honorary captain.\nThere is a statue of Stewart at Waterville that is the Irish match for the bronze that can be viewed at Pinehurst in North Carolina.\nThe Waterville website mentions that less than one percent of the world’s golf courses rate as true links courses, and that 85 percent of them can be found in Ireland and Britain.\nWaterville asserts that it is the greatest links in the Republic, while granting the title to Royal County Down in Northern Ireland.\nThere would be argument over that of course, but both courses are for sure prominent in said argument.\nCloser to Dublin there are a fair few fine links tracks, notably Royal Dublin and Portmarnock, while down the coast a bit, in County Wicklow, there is a true gem called the European Club.\nBut what of that as yet unnamed course so beloved by those peripatetic American eyes?\nMany years ago, the great journalist and broadcaster, Alistair Cooke, spun out a tease on television.\nAt the end of the broadcast he promised that he would deliver his verdict on the woman that he believed was the most beautiful in living memory.\nWell, he went this way and that until the very end at which point he proclaimed his belief that the actress Ava Gardner was his one and only.\nSuch a proclamation was certain to inspire debate of course.\nEvery Hollywood star has a fan club. Every great golf course has a fan club.\nAnd Irish golfers will spend many a long evening arguing for this course and that course – and never quite reach a conclusion.\nBut this assertion is based on the verdict, arguably more objective, of a slew of American golfers who have played this course, or have simply clapped eyes on it, and who have come within earshot of yours truly while announcing their verdict.\nSo this jury is in.\nTo describe it as the “best” course is not applicable because that invites subjective argument from here to eternity.\nBut to describe this course as being the most stunning sight in the most spectacular setting invites greater consensus.\nSo without further ado….Well, with just a little because the reader can have a moment to guess.\nThe course in question can be found on a clenched fist of land off the Cork coast.\nI am speaking (of course!) of Old Head.\nThis promontory peach has prompted a unanimity to a degree and pitch that I have not heard applied to any other golf course in Ireland, and from some, the world.\nReaders might beg to differ, but best to do that after playing Old Head which is just a few miles from Kinsale.\nIn a way, Old Head is itself a metaphor for the entire island when it comes to golf.\nIt reaches out into the sea from a much larger landmass, just as Ireland itself sits in the sea off a much larger landmass.\nBoth metaphor and reality share their other worldly and spectacular natures.\nAnd that’s beyond any argument in any club house bar.\nWe will be reminded of this very soon with the Irish Open at Portstewart, and again two years from now when The Open returns to Royal Portrush.\nFinally, back to that question at the top: Scotland, Ireland, Ireland again. Why?\nNow that’s a tough one but I suspect that the “craic,” as they say, might just be a little mightier in Hibernia than Caledonia.\nOne to argue over a wee dram.... of Irish, of course."

Three years later, the Escondido Country Club Homeowner’s Organization – ECCHO- continues to fight the scaled down project on the 106 acres and said the project is too dense.

It had been reported for much of Friday that Nancy taught at the school — and that Adam may have targeted children in her classroom — but that hypothesis got much murkier late Friday night.\nA former school board official in Newtown called into question earlier reports that Nancy Lanza had been connected to Sandy Hook Elementary School, possibly as part of the teaching staff.\n\"No one has heard of her,\" said Lillian Bittman, who served on the local school board until 2011. \"Teachers don't know her.\"\nAt least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher there.

The team is currently contending for a spot in the MLS, and Berding said he needs a stadium deal hammered out before the end of the year.\n\"We're not here to ask that you only support FC Cincinnati because we have many needs in this community,\" Berding told the three-member commission. \"But we're probably asking to be among the first, given the timeline of the decision.\"\nFC Cincinnati's ask to be first in line is still a big deal.\nThe county is grappling with an overcrowded jail, a dated courthouse and an aging Jobs and Family Services building -- all of which serve hundreds of county families. In 10 years, the county will be grappling with a $266 million maintenance backlog, Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Aluotto said.\nThe city's two current major league sports teams -- the Reds and the Bengals -- will eventually come knocking on the county's door for a new deal. The Bengals stadium lease with the county expires in 2026, and the Reds' lease expires a few years after. Combined, the two stadiums could need more than $200 million in upgrades within the next decade.\n\"While no one is talking about demoing these stadiums, we know there will be substantial maintenance (needs),\" Alutto said.\nCounty taxpayers will need to help pay for some of the $330 million overhaul of the Western Hills Viaduct. Hamilton County Engineer Ted Hubbard has proposed paying for some of that project with an additional $5 driver's license fee.\n\"It needs to be addressed and now,\" Portune said Tuesday.\nA $230 million upgrade of the Duke Energy Convention center is necessary to keep visitors -- and their money -- flowing into the city, experts say. Another $10 million renovation of Sharonville Convention Center is also needed, Sharonville's mayor said Tuesday.\nU.S. Bank Arena owners have asked the Port Authority to buy the deteriorating facility and for taxpayers to finance a $342 million demolition and rebuild it. The building's small and old conditions have caused the city to miss out on huge conventions, most notably the Republican National Convention last year, that would have pumped millions of dollars into the city's economy.\n\"It allows Cincinnati and the county to compete,\" said Nederlander Entertainment COO Ray Harris. \"We're willing to work with anybody to try and make Cincinnati better.\nThe Banks, which taxpayers have already invested $135 million to carve out on Ohio's river, remains unfinished.\nMeanwhile, any money that would be used to pay for these projects is nearly tapped out.\nCounty is painting a bleak picture here for available $. Hotel tax - tapped. Sales tax - a quarter left. None = new stadium or arena.\nThe county can't collect any more hotel tax. Parking revenues generated from garages at The Banks are being used to pay down the debt on those garages. And the county can only legally collect a quarter percent more in sales tax, which would mean buyers pay 7.25 percent on every purchase, bringing in roughly $38 million every year. Hamilton County currently charges a 7 percent sales tax.\nThat little room to fund even one or two of the projects discussed Tuesday.\n\"There is not now, and never will be, enough money to ever fund every major capital project that is before you for consideration,\" said Tim Mara, a Cincinnati attorney and government watchdog who led the charge against a tax increase to pay for Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ball Park more than 20 years ago.\nMara was one of a few speakers who urged commissioners to oppose any taxpayer funding for a new FC Cincinnati stadium.\n\"It makes no sense to divert scarce money to building a soccer stadium when these vital needs remain unfunded,\" he said.\nCommissioners are bracing for a fight over the quarter percent sales tax increase, currently used to pay for a restoration of Union Terminal, that expires in 2020. That sales tax generates roughly $38 million every year. It's been floated as a way to pay for the Western Hills Viaduct, the FC Cincinnati Stadium and, now, U.S. Bank Arena.\nIn a statement released just moments after Tuesday's meeting ended, U.S. Bank Arena leaders called for the county to use that sales tax money for a $342 million overhaul of the 42-year-old facility. That plan would require a seven-year extension of the sales tax.\nBut the clock is ticking for the county to strike a deal that would keep FC Cincinnati on the Ohio side of the river, dozens of soccer fans draped in orange and blue reminded the commissioners Tuesday night.\n\"We have time to do the other projects later, this one needs to take precedent,\" FC Cincinnati Max Ellerbe said."

Doctor had diagonised her with pharyngitis and prescribed amoxicillin for 5 days and paracetamol to reduce the fever.\nDay 1 - she was getting fever 101-102 F temperature and we used to give paracetemol dose each 3-4 hours to control the temperature.\nDay 2 onwards she is having fever of 100-101 and giving paracetamol dose each 8-9 hours time. fever occurrence gap has increased.\nDay 3 we went back to doctor and expressed the concern. Dr said baby is improving and continue with antibiotic and no need to worry about fever, just give paracetamol and it will settle down after 2-3 days.\nParacetamol is an antipyretic that can reduce fever by affecting the part of the brain known as the hypothalamus that regulates the temperature of the body. Any fever that does not go away within seven days, especially while taking paracetamol. Should definitely be seen by a doctor. If your doctor won’t do anything about it, then you should seek an advice from a different pediatrician."

        "text": "I met several customers in the past few weeks who are evaluating Application Performance Management (APM) solution. They are facing a lot of challenges with their existing investments in old generation of APM solution. In this blog, I will outline some of the shortcomings with APM 1.0 tools that make them unfit for today’s applications.\nCustomers have been managing application performance since early days of mainframe evolution. However, Application Performance Management as a discipline has gained popularity in the past decade.\nLet me first introduce what I mean by APM 1.0. The enterprise applications and technologies such as Java have evolved in past two decades. The APM 1.0 tools were invented more than a decade back and they provided great benefits to resolve application issues that were prevalent with the early versions of Java and.NET technologies. However Java/.NET application servers have become mature and do not have those challenges any more. Also enterprise application architecture and technologies have changed drastically and the APM 1.0 tools have not kept up. The following figure shows the evolution of enterprise Java in the past 15 years and when APM 1.0 and APM 2.0 tools have started emerging.\nFollowing are few challenges with the APM 1.0 tools that you will run into when trying to manage your enterprise applications.\nThe application owner and the application support team primarily cares about the user experience and service level delivered by their applications. APM 1.0 tools were primarily built to monitor applications from an application infrastructure perspective.\nThese tools lack the capabilities to monitor applications from real user perspective and help you isolate application issues whether it is caused by the network, load balancers, ADNs such as Akamai, or the application, database, etc. Some of these solutions were quick to add some basic end-user monitoring capabilities such as synthetic monitoring. However an application support personnel has to switch between multiple consoles and depend on manual correlation between end-user monitoring and application deep dive monitoring tools.\nThese tools do not allow you to track a real user request to the line of the code. That means you are blind-sighted when users are impacted and struggle to find what is causing the application failure.\nAPM 1.0 deep-dive monitoring tools were primarily built to diagnose issues during the application development lifecycle. These tools morphed into production deep-dive monitoring tools when the need arose for APM in production environments. So, These tools were not optimized for production monitoring and hence require a lot of effort to tune for production.\nFirst off, the complexities of agent installation and configuration hinder deployment in production environment. Second, these tools usually require configuration changes every time new application code is rolled out.\nMost damagingly, they have high overhead on application performance and do not scale beyond 100-150 application servers. This means that most customers use these in a test environment or enable deep-dive monitoring retroactively after an application failure - assuming the problem will recur.\nFinally, these tools do not provide operation friendly UIs and because they were originally built for developers.\nAs I alluded earlier, the old generation APM tools are very complex to configure because these require application knowledge, manual instrumentation and complex agent deployment. Hence expensive consultants are required to deploy and configure and maintain these tools. These tools also have multiple consoles - adding to total cost of ownership. Some customers told me that they spend a lot of time managing these APM tools rather than being able to manage their applications.\nThese tools were built more than a decade back, and have not evolved much although the application architecture, technologies and methodologies have gone though drastic changes.\nAPM 1.0 tools certainly cannot satisfy these needs. In the next blog, I will discuss how an APM 2.0 solution like BMC Application Management addresses the challenges with APM 1.0 products and help you manage applications better thus improving customer satisfaction and resulting in better bottomline."

I like pitching in Yankee Stadium.\n\"For the right opportunity, I would happily shave this beard off,\" Keuchel said, channeling his inner-Johhny Damon who did so in 2005. \"It's all about winning. I've made that very clear from Day 1 of my career starting to this position right now.\"\nBut don’t stock up on shaving cream just yet, Yankees fans.\nWhile Keuchel, 31, has a history of tormenting the Yankees stretching back to the 2015 wild card game, he struggled a ton this past season.\nThe Yanks, who have made pitching a priority this winter, had their way with the southpaw, tallying seven runs in two wins against Keuchel.\nIt was an overall down year for the 2015 Cy Young winner, who posted career highs in hits allowed, walks and WHIP.\nThe Daily News’ Wally Matthews suggested Brian Cashman stay away in his Yankees free agency primer."

Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, left, before speaking at the Brainerd Kiwanis Club meeting at the Chattanooga Choo Choo on April 21, 2015, in Chattanooga.\nAnyone seeking to unseat U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann next year will need deep pockets.\nTennessee's 3rd District Republican got a big jump-start on fundraising Friday during a private event at the Mountain City Club in Chattanooga.\nThe room was packed with monied supporters from across the 11-county district, and Fleischmann was joined by U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and 8th District U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn.\nWhen Fleischmann arrived, federal reports show his campaign had nearly $147,000 on hand. By the time he left, he had more than $500,000.\nThe Ooltewah lawyer raised more than $370,000 Friday afternoon alone.\nFor perspective, in 2013 and 2014 combined, Fleischmann raised a total of $1.6 million.\nThe purse was the biggest Fleischmann has ever collected at one time.\n\"This time, I am making sure we have the financial wherewithal early, so we can defend any primary challenge,\" Fleischmann said after the event. \"I'd prefer to have no primary challenger, but I'll be ready.\"\nFleischmann has never had an easy primary run in three elections to date.\nLast year, he eked out a win against then-27-year-old Republican challenger Weston Wamp, son of former Rep. Zach Wamp. Fleischmann won the race with 51 percent of the vote to Wamp's 49 percent.\nAnd in 2012, he battled the younger Wamp and Athens, Tenn., dairy icon Scotty Mayfield in the primary. Fleischmann got 39 percent of the vote, Mayfield got 31 percent and Wamp pulled 29 percent.\nHis first run in 2010 was a six-candidate scrum.\nMcCarthy said Friday the Tennessee Republican has been \"very effective\" for the 3rd District by getting funding for Oak Ridge National Laboratory and helping to move things along at the Chickamauga lock from his coveted spot on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen someone get on that [committee] faster than our own Chuck Fleischmann,\" he told the crowd.\nNo one has officially announced a campaign to challenge Fleischmann in the 2016 primary, but politicos have nodded toward state Sen. Bo Watson. And Watson hasn't denied the rumors.\nIn March, Watson said he was focusing on his job in session, not a campaign. But he didn't say whether he would run.\n\"I have people encourage me all the time,\" Watson said. \"I don't rule that out..... I think every election cycle you look at what opportunities might come up.\"\nWatson did not return a telephone message left Friday afternoon for comment.\nWeston Wamp has said he would not seek to run in 2016, but he didn't rule out future bids.\nContact staff writer Louie Brogdon atlbrogdon@timesfreepress.com, @glbrogdoniv on Twitter or at 423-757-6481."

She’s a curator at Pasadena’s Norton Simon Museum, where she has worked since 1987 shortly after earning her master’s in art history at USC.\n“The best thing about Gloria is she knows so much about art, yet she is so happy to share it in a way that does not make you feel you don’t know anything, even though, really, I know nothing about it,” she said. “She makes art enjoyable and she’s so open to accepting all different kinds of art,” said Betty Astor, a friend.\nWhile Williams Sander does not consider herself an artist, her husband is a painter. And for her family of three, including their son Ian, Glendale is a blessing.\nAnd though she’s put considerable effort into lobbying for North Cumberland Heights to become a historical district, it’s been worth it, she said.\nAccording to Jay Platt of the Historic Preservation Commission, for North Cumberland Heights to become a historical district, the city needs to see support from more than 50% of the area’s property owners.\nRoyal Boulevard, Cottage Grove and Ard Eevin Highlands encompass Glendale’s three historical districts. They achieved that designation in 2008 or later."

It determines whether your bank will lend you money to buy a house or car; whether your landlord will accept you as a tenant; which employers will hire you and how much they will pay you. It can even affect your marriage prospects.\nAnd in the present Reputation Economy, it’s getting more powerful than ever. Because today, thanks to rapid advances in digital technology, anyone access huge troves of information about you your buying habits, your finances, your professional and personal networks, and even your physical whereabouts at any time. In a world where technology allows companies and individuals alike to not only gather all this data but also aggregate it and analyze it with frightening speed, accuracy, and sophistication, our digital reputations are fast becoming our most valuable currency.\nToday everything depends on the social score, and everyone is desperate to move up in the rankings. But the omnipresent rating game has one big catch: ranking up is incredibly hard, while ranking down is rapid and easy, like a free-fall.Welcome to the reputation economy, where the individual social graph the social data set about each person determines one’s value in society, access to services, and employability. In this economy, reputation becomes currency.\nOn the web or via mobile, we can now share almost anything. The reputation economy is based on the simplistic, but effective star ratings system. Anyone who’s ever rated their Uber driver or Airbnb host has actively participated. But what happens when algorithms, rather than humans, determine an individual’s reputation score based on multiple data sources and mathematical formulas, promising more accuracy and more flexibility via machine learning to effective star ratings system. promising more accuracy and more flexibility via machine learning?\nOver 60% of companies in Malta currently use social media to screen employees. And many AI-enabled startups are competing in the HR assessment market, using AI to crawl potential candidates’ social media accounts to filter out bad fits. What unifies all current platforms is a reliance on our ability to get enough information about the person we are exchanging with to feel comfortable setting the terms on an individual basis. In other words, they are economies of reputation.\nMuch of the growing interest in these platforms springs from the conflicts we’re seeing in traditional markets. Lack of access to capital, slow market growth, poor employment rates all of these are driving people to find ways to leverage value from other areas of their lives.\nBack In 2012, Facebook applied for a patent that would use an algorithm to assess the credit ratings of friends, as a factor in one’s eligibility to get a mortgage. And China is aiming to implement a national social score for every citizen by 2020, based on crime records, their social media, what they buy, and even the scores of their friends.\nBeing able to accurately or even reasonably accurately measure reputation has immense value. It makes it far easier to find suppliers or business partners and this lowering of transaction cost can create a far more fluid and efficient economy. If you are investing in or supporting small businesses especially in developing countries. It means your resources can go far further. We will increasingly have reputation scores attached to content, to publishers and to journalists, making it easier to find trustworthy information and it might even make dating a little easier. The reputation economy will increasingly drive business and society. Your reputation will precede you wherever you go."

        "text": "President-elect Barack Obama’s transition team held an hour and 15 minute meeting on Tuesday with just over a dozen social justice groups that presented what they see as the concerns of Catholics. In response, some Catholic bishops and commentators have told CNA that they don’t believe these groups’ concerns resonate with those of the Church.\nThe discussion between the Obama transition team and the different representatives touched on international development and trade, health care reform, reducing abortions, immigration, domestic policy and poverty reduction, and the environment.\nThe meeting of the 14 different organizations was organized by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and the lobbying group “Network,” which describes itself as \"a progressive voice within the Catholic community\" that lobbies Congress on justice and peace issues.\nSr. Simone Campbell, director of Network, told the National Catholic Reporter that the meeting was called to \"acknowledge the work that some of the Catholic groups had done in the Catholic community during the election and to begin to develop relationships for ‘post-Jan. 20,’ when the new administration takes over after Obama’s inauguration.\"\nJames Salt, Organizing Director of Catholics United, explained to CNA that Catholics United participated in the meeting by highlighting \"key policies that are important to Catholics.\n\"Specifically we want the new administration to take seriously its commitment to reduce abortions in America. People of goodwill from both sides of the conversation can agree that 1 million abortions a year are 1 million abortions too many. We wanted to make sure that the Obama administration knew this was one of our highest priorities.\"\nYet, when Salt was asked if Catholics United planned to hold Obama accountable for his pledge to work to reduce abortions, he was cautious. \"We're hopeful that the Obama administration is with us on abortion reduction. We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\"\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \"many efforts underway and planned\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops’ Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish…the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\n\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation's 60 million Catholics,\" Wenski said.\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting’s make up. \"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they're far less clever than I think they are. This strikes me as simply a pay-off to people who, from the Obama campaign's point of view, helped with the ground game in 2008.\"\nThe proof of the social justice groups’ commitment to promoting Catholic concerns will be in \"how these ‘Platform for the Common Good’ folks help the rest of the Catholic Church defeat the Freedom of Choice Act and maintain the Bush administration's AIDS and malaria-reduction initiatives in Africa, which has helped millions more poor people than any of these groups has ever managed to do,\" Weigel explained to CNA.\nBishop of Madison Robert Morlino also added that the transition team must do more to dialogue with the Catholic Church. \"Recognizing the stark contrast between the positions on abortion of the President-elect and the teachings of the Catholic Church, it would be a mistake for the President-elect's transition team to pretend that this meeting satisfied his promise of dialoguing with the Catholic community,\" he said.\nThe bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, also weighed-in on the meeting by addressing what a Catholic organization should be emphasizing. He told CNA that “Being'right' on any number of other issues will never outweigh the taking of human life through abortion. It would be my hope that any group calling themselves'Catholic' would make this message abundantly clear, and express grave concern over the possibilities that the new administration may increase funding for abortions with public money or even erode conscience protections for Catholic hospitals and healthcare workers.\"\nFinally, Brian Burch, who heads a group of four lay Catholic organizations in the political, legal, research and educational fields, also expressed misgivings about the ability of the social justice consortium to rein in Obama’s policies.\n\"We are pleased to hear that the Obama transition team is interested in talking with Catholics, but caution that such conversations must be weighed against his reported plans on abortion policy, including his Cabinet selections thus far. Specifically, we remain concerned that the new Administration is composed of leading abortion advocates who are preparing to overturn a large number of existing pro-life laws, while proving hundreds of millions of new taxpayer dollars for abortion.\n\"The fact that transition officials are consulting a select group of Catholic organizations who supported Obama's candidacy is not surprising. Whether these groups, some of whom claim to adhere to Catholic teaching, are able to hold him accountable on the issue of life, remains doubtful.\""

        "text": "(Conakry) – The fifth anniversary on September 28, 2014, of the Conakry stadium massacre should be the last before justice is done, seven Guinean and international organizations, in unity with the victims, said today. More than 150 people were killed, some 100 women were raped and several hundred people were injured on September 28, 2009, as government troops attacked peaceful demonstrators.\nSince legal proceedings began in February 2010, close to 400 victims have been interviewed by the judges leading the case. But only eight people have been charged, though offenses were committed by scores of members of the armed forces, particularly the Red Berets. The military junta in power at the time of the massacre was headed by Moussa Dadis Camara.\nThere has been real progress in justice in recent months, the groups said. The establishment of a High Judicial Council in July, the ongoing improvement in the status of judges and the start of justice reform are all likely to help the judges complete their work.\nThere has been some progress in the legal case in recent weeks, including questioning of the director of Conakry stadium, the former Minister for Youth and Sport and, through an international rogatory commission, Dadis Camara, who has taken refuge in Burkina Faso. These new developments are in contrast to the slow pace that long characterized the proceedings.\nAdministering justice for the victims is all the more urgent because scores of victims have died in the past five years from their injuries or disease without being vindicated, the groups said.\nDespite the government’s stated commitments, a lack of financial and political support has been a major obstacle to the progress of the investigation. The government needs to guarantee that all of the people summoned for questioning, including members of the security forces, regardless of their rank, answer the summonses issued by the judges. On several occasions, despite repeated summonses, the judges have not been able to interview people summoned for questioning about the events of September 28, 2009.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC), which opened a preliminary examination on October 14, 2009, and which is continuing to monitor this case closely, has already alerted the national authorities to the need to conduct these proceedings within a reasonable time frame."

Opposition from family and society is natural. I guess that���s how the society reacts. But some of us are just not made to follow the societal norms. My immense love for music coupled with my adamant nature didn���t let me settle for anything apart from music. For me, music is like medicine.\nDespite hailing from Kolkata, you never thought of composing for Bengali films.\nOf course I do. I���d love to work with Srijit Mukherji and Kaushik Ganguly.\nHow much are you clued in to Bengali film music?\nI left Kolkata around eight years back and Bengali film music has come a long way since then. I love Anupamda���s (Roy) songwriting and compositions. He is brilliant. The song Ek baar bol tor keu nei is one of my favourites.\nHeard you used to fight with your mother as a kid because you were forced to learn Rabindrasangeet?\nOh yes! Protidin ma er sanghe jhogra hotoh gaan sekha niye! But now Rabindrasangeet is my fave. There are times when I just sit quietly and listen to the songs. During my college days, I used to love rock. Fossils was at its peak then. I grew up listening to Kabir Suman, Anjan Dutt and so on.\nDo you catch up with your old friends whenever you come down to Kolkata?\nI do meet my school friends when I come here. Right now, Kolkata seems to be brimming with joy as Durga Puja is just weeks away. But sadly, I���m going to miss it this time as I would be out of the country for work. What I will miss the most are pandal-hopping and eating out in the wee hours.\nAre you in touch with other Bengali music directors based in Mumbai?\nOf course. I have known Pritamda very well since I was nominated for my debut in Jism2 and for my second film, Yaariyan. I was lucky to score the soundtrack along with him, Mithoon and YoYo Honey Singh. We won the best music award for it too. Pritamda is very warm and often invites us over to his house. Jeetda (Gannguli) is like family to me. His wife is my mom���s student and they are the sweetest people on earth. We often hang out in a group for adda where we don���t talk work. I don���t know Shantanu Moitra personally, but whenever we meet he is extremely encouraging and supportive.\nHow is the competition in Mumbai music industry?\nQuite tough, but fair at the same time. What matters there is your song���s merit and nothing else.\nMost of your songs, which are also penned by you, are hits. Does that create a pressure on you when you compose your next song?\nThere are certain expectations when you work with big stars and banners. But I take it more as a compliment than a burden.\nWell the list is endless -- my childhood, daily experiences, the people around, my lovers, travelling and imagination.\nWhile promoting Rustom in Kolkata, Akshay Kumar crooned Tere sang yaara, which is composed by you.

Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune President Thomas S. Monson's empty seat during the afternoon session of the 187th Annual General Conference at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City Saturday, April 1, 2017. Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune Elder Neil L. Andersen, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, speaks during the afternoon session of the 187th Annual General Conference at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City Saturday, April 1, 2017.\nDuring a time of jarring political polarity and town hall meetings marred by shouts and boos, several top Mormon officials Saturday strongly condemned hostility and hatred as anathema to Christian discipleship.\n\"Someday I hope a great global chorus will harmonize across all racial and ethnic lines,\" apostle Jeffrey R. Holland said, \"declaring that guns, slurs and vitriol are not the way to deal with human conflict.\"\nHolland was among more than a dozen speakers who addressed tens of thousands of Mormons in downtown Salt Lake City and millions more around the world, tuned into the LDS Church&apos;s 187th Annual General Conference.\nOne voice the faithful didn&apos;t hear during the morning and afternoon sessions was that of LDS Church President Thomas S. Monson. The increasingly frail 89-year-old leader presided over the morning gathering after being helped to his seat.\nIn the afternoon, that chair  between Henry B. Eyring and Dieter F. Uchtdorf, his two counselors in the governing First Presidency  sat noticeably vacant.\nA spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said Monson, viewed by Mormons as a \"prophet, seer and revelator,\" was \"conserving his energy\" for the remainder of the weekend&apos;s sessions.\nMonson has led the 15.8 million-member church for more than nine years; Mormon presidents serve for life.\nTwo years ago, the Utah-based religion announced Monson was \"feeling the effects of advancing age.\" Since then, the longtime LDS leader, who also didn&apos;t attend last Saturday&apos;s women&apos;s meeting, has been scaling back his conference sermons.\nOther speakers had no trouble preaching with passion about current ills.\n\"Economic deprivation is a curse that keeps on cursing, year after year and generation after generation. It damages bodies, maims spirits, harms families, and destroys dreams,\" Holland said, decrying poverty and lamenting that \"so many around us suffer from mental and emotional illness or other debilitating health limitations.\"\nThe former president of LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University pleaded with members to stay in the faith&apos;s expanding fold.\n\"There is room for those who speak different languages, celebrate diverse cultures, and live in a host of locations. There is room for the single, the married, for large families and for the childless,\" he said. \"There is room for those who once had questions regarding their faith and room for those who still do. There is room for those with differing sexual attractions.\"\nIn short, Holland proclaimed, \"there is a place for everyone who loves God.\"\nFellow apostle Robert D. Hales said as Latter-day Saints follow Christ, \"there will be no disparity between the kindness we show our enemies and the kindness we bestow on our friends. We will be as honest when no one is looking at us as when others are watching. We will be as devoted to God in the public square as we are in our private closet.\"\nLike the parable of the good Samaritan, true believers \"cross the road to minister to whomever is in need, even if they are not within the circle of our friends,\" Hales said. \"We bless them that curse us. We do good to those who despitefully use us. Is any attribute more godly or Christlike?\"\nIn the morning, apostle Dale G. Renlund cautioned Mormons against railing on opponents.\n\"We must guard against bigotry that raises its ugly voice toward those who hold different opinions. Bigotry manifests itself, in part, in unwillingness to grant equal freedom of expression,\" he said. \"Everyone, including people of religion, has the right to express his or her opinions in the public square.\"\nRenlund, a physician by training, spent his teen years in Europe in the 1960s, where he felt \"picked on and bullied\" as an American, he said, \"as though I were personally responsible for unpopular foreign policies.\"\nDuring that time, he also witnessed the \"ugliness of prejudice and discrimination suffered by those who are targeted because of their race or ethnicity.\"\nIn LDS history, Mormons were persecuted for their faith, Renlund noted. \"How ironically sad it would be if we were to treat others as we have been treated..... Let us fully mirror [Jesus&apos;] love and love one another so openly and completely that no one feels abandoned, alone or hopeless.\"\nEyring, who spoke first Saturday, addressed Mormons&apos; theological drive to seek out their ancestors  a practice they believe opens the door of the LDS gospel to long dead kin  and the growing fascination with genealogy among millions of others.\n\"Interest in exploring one&apos;s family history has grown exponentially. At ever-increasing rates, people seem drawn to their ancestry with more than just casual curiosity,\" he said. \"Genealogical libraries, associations and technologies have emerged around the world to support this interest.\"\nHe said the \"hearts of the children  you and me  have turned to our fathers, our ancestors. The affection you feel for your ancestors is.... deeply seated in your sense of who you are. But it has to do with more than just inherited DNA.\"\nThe morning&apos;s concluding speaker was Russell M. Nelson, senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and next in the line for the church presidency.\nNelson touted the power of faith to change lives.\n\"True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from people of the world,\" the 92-year-old leader said. Faith \"propels us to do things we otherwise would not do. Faith that motivates us to action gives us more access to his power.\"\nWhen believers \"reach up for the Lord&apos;s power.... with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air,\" Nelson promised, \"power from Jesus Christ will be yours. When the savior knows you truly want to reach up to him  when he can feel that the greatest desire of your heart is to draw his power into your life  you will be led by the Holy Ghost to know exactly what you need to do.\"\nIn the afternoon, apostle Neil L. Andersen emphasized the importance of \"overcoming the world,\" rising above earthly concerns and focusing on God.\n\"Overcoming the world is not a global invasion, but a private, personal battle, requiring hand-to-hand combat with our own internal foes,\" Andersen said. \"The world, on the other hand, is more interested in indulging the natural man than in subduing him.\"\nOne of those indulgences is social media. \"A disciple of Christ is not alarmed if a post about her faith does not receive 1,000 likes or even a few friendly emojis,\" Andersen said. \"Overcoming the world is less concerned with our online connections and more concerned with our heavenly connection to God.\"\nFellow apostle M. Russell Ballard advised the faithful to set goals for their lives and make plans to achieve them, \"within the framework of our Heavenly Father&apos;s eternal plan.\"\nThe most important aims, he said, are \"to return to [God&apos;s] presence and to receive the eternal blessings that come from making and keeping covenants.\"\nBallard warned about \"loud voices\" used by Satan  including the mass media, the internet and social media  \"that seek to drown out the small and still voice of the Holy Spirit that can show us &apos;all things&apos; we should do to return and receive.\"\n\"We must keep the doctrine and gospel of Jesus Christ at the center of our goals and plans,\" Ballard said. \"Without him, no eternal goal is possible, and our plans to achieve our eternal goals will surely fail.\"\nNo women spoke Saturday, but three new female leaders were named to lead the women&apos;s Relief Society.\nEditor David Noyce and reporter Sean P. Means contributed to this story."

        "text": "A plan to build fifty giant wind turbines in the province of Drenthe may interfere with the operation of a radio telescope and do ‘disastrous’ damage to scientific research, according to the Dutch Institute for Radio Astronomy (Astron).\nAstronomers claim that the placement of the 200 metre high windmills will interfere with the low-frequency array (Lofar) which uses thousands of low-frequency antennae to survey the universe. Because of their height, the windmills reflect other radio and television signals towards the Lofar station.\nMinister for economic affairs Henk Kamp has a year to decide whether to continue with the project. The plan has already been criticized by local residents and municipalities.\nThe Dutch telecom agency is currently looking into whether windmills interfere with radio telescope operation in Drenthe.\nMinister Kamp gave the project the go-ahead based on a study by a British company, which found that the operation of the telescope would not suffer if windmills were placed nearby. However, Astron argues that the British researchers didn’t have sufficient knowledge to make that claim.\nAstronomers at the Lofar site would prefer if the windmills were at least 15km away from the telescope. The current plan would see seven of the fifty turbines placed within a 15km radius of the Lofar site.\n‘It might not sound like too much of a difference, but going from a few kilometres to fifteen really makes a big difference when it comes to the strength of the reflected signals,’ said Garrett."

While its initial objective was to serve its global clients having Chinese operations, the company has now started addressing the regional and local market. Currently, it has 1,300 employees working in China. In its latest annual report, TCS said its China operations had managed to break even.\nAccording to Girija Pande, executive vice-president and head of Asia Pacific division at TCS, the Chinese IT market is growing by at least 20% annually and revenue from the company’s Chinese operations will grow by around 45% in the next two years.\n“In the short term, we will be expanding our presence and increasing the headcount to at least 5,000 by 2011,\" said Pande.\nSimilarly, Infosys has a 1,000-strong workforce in China and said it is in expansion mode. “We have expanded our operations in two cities Shanghai and Hangzhou,\" a company spokesperson said in an email response. The company’s Chinese subsidiaries, however, were still loss-making as on 30 September, according to the company’s second quarter results.\nSatyam admitted it is yet to make significant headway with its China operations but said it is in expansion mode with an eye on the long-term.\nThe company currently employs around 1,000 people in its two subsidiaries in China and plans to scale up headcount to nearly 2,000 by 2010. It is also investing in a training centre in China, which will have a capacity of at least 2,500 by 2010.\n“It is still a mystery why Indian companies have not been able to get any significant share of outsourced work from China and Japan,\" said Virender Aggarwal, head of rest of the world operations for Satyam.\nAnalysts acknowledge that China has been a rather difficult market for a variety of reasons.\n“So far, the Chinese domestic market has been one that is difficult to engage, primarily because of state and public sector dominance,\" said Milan Sheth, partner and head of IT outsourcing advisory at audit and consulting firm Ernst and Young. “It is critical to have a well connected and established Chinese local partner who can help penetrate that market,\" he said.\nTCS said it views China as a better base to address the Japanese market. “A significant share of outsourced work from the Japanese market is cornered by Chinese companies, as they have a relative cultural and linguistic advantage over their Indian counterparts. We see being present in China as the first step in building the right relationships,\" said Pande.\nBoth TCS and Satyam are betting on local talent to succeed in their Chinese operations and help the company better address the local market as well as help build bridges with Japanese companies. At least 90% of TCS’ workforce in China comprises local hires.\nNasscom’s Som Mittal said that the size of the Japanese IT market and the potential for outsourcing presents a huge opportunity for Indian IT firms, but, he added that the market has been relatively insulated due to language and cultural barriers. “However, we see an increasing desire among Japanese companies for sourcing competitively priced IT services from foreign companies. More importantly, the factors limiting market penetration by Indian companies are being recognized and addressed by the Japanese themselves.\"\nNasscom has set up a Japan desk to explore ways for Indian IT companies to adapt themselves to compete more effectively in the Japanese market.\nBoth China and Japan are long-term plays, said experts.\n“It is very important for Indian IT companies to understand that investments in the Chinese market should be done with a long term view. Given the nature of that market, it is unrealistic to expect quick turnarounds,\" Sheth said.\nWipro and HCL did not respond to queries on their China and Japan strategy."

On Saturday, he and the other members of the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players will perform\"Iolanthe,\" a satire set in a fairyland, at the Palace Theater in Stamford.\nAs a\"patter\" man, Mr. Reed must speak lines that are exercises in rapid-fire phonetics.\n\"It's just fast and furious,\" said Mr. Reed, a native of northern England who now splits his career between Britain and the United States.\nOne of the most famous patter songs in the Gilbert and Sullivan repertory is\"The Nightmare Song\" from\"Iolanthe,\" which he performs.\n\"It goes on forever,\" Mr. Reed said.\n\"Iolanthe\" will treat lovers of breathless buffoonery to not one but three such exercises in elocution, all performed by Mr. Reed.\nMr. Reed has to have impeccable diction to get the lyrics across to the audience. And every single note has to be right. But in 1951, when he joined the famous D'Oyly Carte Company in London, which was founded in 1878 by Richard D'Oyly Carte, the producer of the first operas by William S. Gilbert and Arthur S. Sullivan, things were different.\nBut by 1959, Mr. Reed had taken over all the company's comedic roles. There were eight performances every week, then seven or eight tours in England and abroad.\"I wonder how we did it,\" he said. His efforts were deemed worthy by Queen Elizabeth II, who bestowed him with the Order of the British Empire in 1976.\nMr. Reed left the D'Oyly Carte two years before its demise in 1981.\nThree years ago, Mr. Reed performed in the Washington Opera production of\"Trial by Jury\" at the Kennedy Center. That is where he met Mr. Bergeret, and they have performed together several times since.\nNow Mr. Reed spends half his time performing and the other half directing.

        "text": "The Moto Z2 Play and Z2 Force give you maximum customization at a minimal price.\nWiredYou won't find mods as useful or well-designed on other phones. Motorola's gestures are handy. Fantastic battery life, especially on the Moto Z2 Play. Storage is expandable via MicroSD.\nTiredWhere's the waterproofing? The Z2 Force has no headphone jack. The best Moto Mods are pricey, as are these phones. The cameras are acceptable, but still need work.\nA lot of Android phones claim to be different, but Motorola’s Z series backs up that claim. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, the Moto Z phones have something that other phones just don’t. The new Moto Z2 Force and Moto Z2 Play have magnetic Mods that snap onto the back of them, adding new features. What you think about those Mods will determine whether either of the two Moto Z2 phones are right for you.\nWhatever you’re doing, Moto wants to have a Mod for that. Snap on a battery pack if you’re going off grid, or maybe a 360-degree camera so you can capture everything on that nature hike. Pop on a speaker and you can pump up the jams, or attach Motorola’s brand new Polaroid printer Mod that lets you instantly print out any photo you take. You can even buy a Mod that turns your phone into an Amazon Echo speaker, complete with a glowing blue ring.\nThere are more than a dozen of these Mods, and they all magnetically cling to the back of the rather svelte Z2, which feels almost too thin and flat without one. Moto Mods are the defining reason to buy a Moto Z2 Play and its more expensive sibling, the Z2 Force. But they don’t come cheap. Many of these doodads cost upward of a hundred bucks.\nMy Moto Z2s have worn a lot of Mods in the last few weeks. I found most of them fun, but I didn’t want to keep any of them snapped on forever. Many of them make the phone a little too fat. My favorite was a battery pack, which I kept in my back and snapped on whenever I had a long day ahead of me. Oddly, I rarely needed it. Both the Z2 Force and Play get excellent battery life without augmentation. I was able to use the Z2 Play for two days straight after forgetting to charge it, though it was gasping for a charge by the second evening. That kind of battery life is hard to come by these days.\nBoth Moto Z2 phones are nearly identical from the outside. They have large glass 5.5-inch screens above a nice fingerprint sensor. The sides and back are smooth, brushed aluminum with a large circular bump for the rear camera. Ridges on the power button make it easy to distinguish from the volume keys, all of which sit on the right side of the phone. Charging via the USB C slot on the bottom is also pretty standard.\nInitially, I was bothered by how flat the back of the phone feels. It doesn’t contour to your palm like some phones. After a few days, I got used to it and now appreciate how thin these phones feel, though I still recommend a bumper case, like this one from Lenovo.\nSetting aside the lack of waterproofing on either phone, the only problem with the design is that it’s large for one-handed use. This is an extra-large phone, and if that bothers you, consider the smaller and cheaper Moto X4.\nBoth phones also run Motorola’s slight twist on Android 7 Nougat (the new Android 8 Oreo is promised, but not out yet). Most of what’s here is identical to other Android phones, but there are a few Moto Action gestures that I like to use. You can twist the phone to open the camera and swipe it down and up like you’re swinging an ax to turn on and off the flashlight. Even better are the home button gestures, which let you dump the onscreen back, home, and multitasking buttons in favor of swiping left, right, and pressing on the home button. It takes a good day to get used to it, but swiping is very intuitive, and a great reason to stick with a phone with a home button fingerprint sensor, like this one.\nThe 12-megapixel rear cameras perform similarly, as well. I snapped some lovely night photos on a trip to New York City, and the camera did a decent job balancing dark areas and bright Christmas light displays at Saks Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Center. The Moto Z2 Play has been my go-to camera for three weeks now. Despite what feels like a second of lag when pressing the shutter button, it hasn’t hampered my ability to take timely shots. The 5-megapixel front camera on each is decent, but has had some trouble in low-light situations. The rear camera’s 4K (30fps) video support is also nice. If you’re picky about your photos though, neither of these can match the shooters on the new iPhone X or Pixel 2.\nBoth Z2 models will work on most wireless carriers, have 64GB storage (with MicroSD slots), and 4GB of RAM. Still, there are a few vital differences between these phones that I’m going to sum up quickly.\nThe Z2 Force is the fancier $720 version. It has an extra rear camera (that, to be honest, does not add a whole lot to the experience), a cutting-edge Snapdragon 835 processor (this does speed the phone up substantially if you use intense apps or games), and a higher-resolution Quad HD screen that will supposedly withstand falls better. It also comes with a \"Shattershield\" screen cover stuck on it that’s sharp around the edges. What you lose is a headphone jack and a few hours of battery life. It’s also imperceptibly thicker.\nThe Moto Z2 Play has a weaker Snapdragon 626 processor, larger battery, FM radio, and standard HD screen. I was legitimately shocked when I found out both screens had a different resolution, which shows just how adequate a 1080p screen still is. Both Super AMOLED displays look excellent.\nI still like having a headphone jack and the slightly slower performance of the Moto Z2 Play is an easy tradeoff for the savings. The $500 64GB Unlocked version of the Moto Z2 Play is my favorite model (linked in the Buy buttons on this review), though there is a Verizon-only edition for $408.\nThere are a few truly high-end phones you can buy for $500 or less, like the OnePlus 5T or Essential Phone, but neither of them have Moto Mods. That’s the reason to choose a Moto Z phone.\nThe 64GB Unlocked Moto Z2 Play is a fantastic phone, if Moto Mods interest you. If they don’t, I can’t help but direct you to the other Moto in the room, the Moto X4."

Lauletta did not play against the Bears but made his NFL debut with a 40-0 fourth-quarter lead against the Redskins.\nLauletta went 0-for-5 with an interception as the Giants won 40-16.\nRookie quarterback Kyle Lauletta debuted for Giants in the 40-16 blowout win against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, December 9, 2018 (12/9/18) at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. His teammates and Richmond coaches say there is much more coming than the box score showed.\nThe Giants did not hide their disappointment with Lauletta after the game.\n\"I don't think we had enough there to evaluate how he did,\" coach Pat Shurmur said after the game. \"I would've liked a couple more completions and to not throw that interception, certainly.\n\"We felt like,'OK, let's take a look at him and see.' I fielded enough questions regarding Kyle Lauletta that we were interested in seeing him. Hopefully, you got a chance to see what you were looking for.\"\nIf the true reason the Giants were interested in seeing him was because of the amount of media questions about him in the weeks when the team started 1-7, that is troubling.\nAfter all, they used a fourth-round pick on Lauletta when an offensive tackle, pass-rusher or cornerback could've helped immediately.\nIf the Giants feel Lauletta is far off being able to play in a game, that is more of a question of the pick than of the people asking if he should be inserted into a game during a lost season, especially considering Giants owner John Mara saying it was a mistake not to play a rookie quarterback (Davis Webb) last season.\nShurmur said Wednesday that Lauletta was the No. 2 quarterback but subject to change. He also declined to commit to a backup quarterback when asked Friday.\nAsked if he saw anything encouraging from Lauletta beyond the box score, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Shula succinctly said, \"Yeah, he got experience.\"\nThe Giants still are alive in the NFC playoff race and can't be eliminated this weekend if they beat the Titans. A loss spells elimination.\nWill the Giants re-open the door for Lauletta under those circumstances? Shurmur admitted more evaluation is needed, but Lauletta is going the wrong way on the depth chart, rather than nipping at Manning's heels to be the starter in 2019.\nManning has stepped up his play of late, with the Giants offense averaging more than 28 points per game during a 4-1 stretch over the last five games.\nThe purpose of the switch back to Tanney is unclear, though Shurmur does like having a veteran quarterback as a backup on gamedays.\nOnce he made the move to Lauletta, however, he is risking shaken confidence for a rookie handling a setback with seemingly little to gain because the Giants will not bench Manning and he is as injury-proof as any NFL quarterback ever."

During the brief hearing, counsel for the NGO Ambareesh Singh Bhadauria said that there should be “preventive action” by the government to protect the public from buying or renting “illegal” premises.\nCiting the example of the Coca Cola building in Mumbai, the PIL alleges that buyers are usually unaware of the legal status of the properties and may be put under the impression that the property is “authorised”. “By the time the buyer realises that the property is an unauthorised development and that the developer has cheated and defrauded, it is too late,” the plea states.\nArora said under the present rules, any unauthorised construction is “booked” and the information is sent to the sub-registrar in the Delhi government’s Revenue department, so that the sale or rent deeds of the property cannot be registered.\nThe High Court asked the government and the South corporation to give a status report on the number of properties that have been booked and the details of the guidelines to prohibit the “transfer of properties that are unauthorisedly constructed or booked”."

        "text": "The Solar Decathlon is a wonderful idea, where teams from all over the world compete to design the most energy-efficient buildings which are, of course, solar powered. Most have tended to be the size of mobile homes, so that they can be built at the universities and shipped to the decathlon, and then shipped home. Most entries act like mobile homes, being detached buildings that will stand alone.\nThe DPD is a uniquely syncretic product of our study of two proven traditional housing typologies born of different cultures. The row house typology, typical of Montreal’s urban fabric, accommodates single-family scenarios in a long and narrow low-rise form. The Siheyuan courtyard house demonstrates an environmentally and culturally specific approach to city dwelling of great historic, social, and functional value.\nThe DPD is also designed to the Passive House standard, which can be a challenge in a city like Montreal; there is a reason that an unofficial anthem for Quebec is Gilles Vigneault’s “Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver” (My country is not a country, it's winter). So it has a lot of insulation, an energy recovery ventilation system, and is designed for serious air-tightness. I looked in vain to see who the Passive House consultants were but see that they are “using passive design and construction principles” to design “a net-zero energy capable dwelling”. A press release says that it is a “Passive House-inspired design”.\nAnother feature of the house is that it is prefabricated.\nA key innovation of the DPD is the utilization of off-site (factory) prefabrication methods of construction. It is designed for both modular & panelized options. Prefabrication addresses issues of affordability, reduction of waste, health and safety of workers, greater export capacity, and quality control to achieve high-performance building standards. Quebec’s prefabrication industry is one of the most robust in North America and its expansion into the high-performance building industry is a key to its development.\nBut they are not doing Passive House quality prefabs in Quebec yet, so the team turned to Ecocor in Maine, which builds houses from Passive House quality panels. Chris Corson, founder and President of Ecocor tells TreeHugger that there was nobody in the Province who could deliver this and having seen Ecocor’s work at the North American Passive House Network conference last year I can believe it, these are closer to cabinetry than wall panels. They had to be modified so that they could be easily taken apart in Montreal and reassembled in China, and the insulation was changed from Corson’s preferred, cellulose, to what everyone in Canada loves (it’s made there), Roxul rock wool.\nIt has all the smart home stuff, including “Sensor networks and Internet of Things technologies installed throughout the home for performance and durability monitoring, consumption, and automation.” But with that much insulation, and being a townhouse with neighbours on either side, it is also what I like to call a dumb home- it is resilient in the face of power outages, and could keep people warm and safe for weeks.\nTeamMTL’s goal is to employ socially, culturally and technologically advanced architecture that embodies energy efficiency, comfort, wellbeing, affordability, environmental sustainability and ecological awareness. Sustainable building starts with quality construction and design, and Ecocor’s 21st Century, prefab approach to building the most energy efficient homes on the market today helped us reach our objectives.\nIt really does press all the buttons; small, urban design built with the most sophisticated prefab technologies to the highest standards of energy efficiency and comfort. Most solar decathlon designs are one-offs but I hope this one gets multiple printings."

        "text": "For more than a decade, Daveyton's Mayor, Tom Boya, was Pretoria's evidence of the legitimacy of the municipal councils running its segregated black townships.\nAs president of the United Municipalities of South Africa, an organization of black municipal officials, Mr. Boya put aside his mayoral duties and traveled as far afield as the United States and Brazil to discourse on the concerns of local government.\nBut he recently stunned a crowd of 80,000 residents of Daveyton by announcing that he was quitting his posts. He said the system with which he had become identified had no future. Whether motivated by conscience or survival, his unexpected resignation elicited wild cheers and seemed to signal the beginning of the end for black township governments.\nMr. Boya, who is 39 years old, said the handwriting appeared on the wall after the African National Congress was made legal and Nelson Mandela released in February. \"I realized there was no room any more for a person to serve in a structure created by the Government,\" he said.\nHis decision to quit, he said, was prompted by his inability to stop the state-owned power company from switching off Daveyton's electricity for four days recently because of unpaid bills. He said it illustrated the frustrations he had faced in Daveyton since joining its town council in 1978.\n\"The weakness of the black local authorities was simply lack of funds, lack of local sources of revenue,\" Mr. Boya said. But, he quickly added, \"the structures were illegitimate\" because the white minority Government had imposed them on blacks.\nTheir resources are not shared with the satellite black townships, which began as stark dormitories for blacks working at menial jobs in white areas and which suffer chronic poverty and unemployment.\nAnti-apartheid civic associations have organized boycotts of rent and utility payments to protest inferior living conditions, which deprive municipal governments of the modest revenue upon which they depend. The associations have accused municipal officials like Mr. Boya of being puppets of apartheid.\nSatisfied that the crisis had been resolved, Mr. Boya flew to Rio de Janeiro for a conference. In his absence, the deal collapsed when the Transvaal Provincial Administration insisted that most of the money paid go to pay municipal wages and only a little to the utility company. He returned home to find the electricity turned off and his constituents irate.\n\"I felt so lonely,\" Mr. Boya said. \"I felt rejected. I felt betrayed.\"\nThe electricity was turned back on after residents took the utility company to court.\nMr. Boya's foreboding about the future of black local government was heightened when he went to a United Municipalities conference recently and found only 8 of its 60 municipal councils represented.\nMr. Boya said he went to the other rally and decided to quit. \"You could have heard a pin when I went over to the podium,\" he said. \"I then offered my resignation.\"\nJames Ngubo, chairman of the Daveyton Interim Committee said that \"Mr. Boya coming out really symbolizes that the system is bankrupt.\" He said the white minority Government had set up Mr. Boya as a \"good black man\" to make black local authorities palatable. His group had pressed Mr. Boya to resign, Mr. Ngubo said, and the power cuts \"must have been the last straw for him.\"\nFour other Daveyton councillors have followed Mr. Boya's example.\nMr. Boya predicted the inevitable collapse of all township government structures. \"I think it will be very healthy when it happens,\" he said. \"From those ruins, we can build.\"\nHe said municipalites must encompass white and black communities together and pool their revenue. And municipalities, he said, should be defined by region instead of race.\n\"The Government should abolish black local authorities and white local authorities and call for an election of local authorities under one umbrella,\" he said."

        "text": "ZTE, Huawei: Can China ever become a true innovation powerhouse? A Future Tense event.\nWill China’s Scientists and Technologists Ever Be Truly Innovative?\nFrom left: Adam Segal, Denis Simon, Yifei Sun, and Steve LeVine.\nJust this week, a House of Representatives committee issued a report warning the United States against doing business with two major Chinese tech firms, ZTE and Huawei. The companies were closely tied to the Chinese government, the report said, and could be stealing information from the U.S. government and American businesses.\nIn opening remarks, Steve LeVine, Washington correspondent for Quartz magazine and a Bernard L. Schwartz fellow, established the questions for the day: Can China ever become an “innovation juggernaut,” just as it is a world leader in manufacturing? Does “innovation” have to mean breakthroughs, or is incremental innovation—small tweaks on Western-made technology to make it cheaper and sometimes better—enough? And should the rest of the world be worried?\n-Creativity isn’t encouraged: Segal argued that while we focus on the “hardware”—the more tangible results of innovation, like patents filed—China needs to focus on the “software” problems of culture. In China, researchers aren’t urged to think creatively, nor do they feel free to fail. “No risk, no reward” may be a cliché, but it is also a truism.\n-Quantity is valued over quality: According to Huang, the number of journal articles published by Chinese researchers has exploded in recent years. But outside of the life sciences and biology, the level of impact from this research has remained fairly flat—indicating that the research is not high-quality. In part, this may be because researchers are paid per publication, so repetitive research and short-term work is incentivized.\n-Intellectual property rights are not respected: Since patents and copyrights are frequently violated, there is less incentive to create.\nChina’s leadership understands all of these things, said Segal. In fact, they have probably visited Silicon Valley “more than anyone,” he joked. Accordingly, China’s 2006 mid- to long-term plan for science and technology development emphasized the need for better intellectual property protection, for startup culture. But politically, introducing these elements will be very difficult—especially, as Simon noted, because the politicians have other significant worries on their minds, like domestic protests. Still, they understand that the “transition to a knowledge economy” is critical, and accordingly they want to be the No. 1 or No. 2 country in the world for innovation by 2049—China’s centennial. That’s one reason why they are expanding investment into R&D, going from 1 percent of GDP for a long time to 2 percent of GDP in 2011. But China isn’t doing this only for financial reasons, according to Segal—the country also wants not to have to depend on the West for its technological and scientific needs.\nThere are some positive signs here for China. For instance, Simon said that more and more research funding is coming in at the local level, not from the national government—a “systemic change,” he termed it. And while many Western companies opened their research labs in China initially because the government effectively made it a condition for selling goods in the country, said Sun, they are increasingly producing interesting work. No breakthroughs yet, he acknowledged, but they may come soon. China’s most successful fields—nanotechnology, life sciences, biology—are those that have been open to international collaboration.\nWatch the entire event on the New America Foundation website."

        "text": "WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators voted Wednesday to require companies to reveal more information about how they pay their executives amid a public outcry over compensation.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-to-1 to expand the disclosure requirements for public companies.\nCompany policies that encouraged excessive risk-taking and rewarded executives for delivering short-term profits were blamed for fueling the financial crisis.\nThe SEC also changed a formula that critics say allowed companies to understate how much their senior executives are paid. At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings. Such awards often make up most of top executives' pay.\nThe new requirements include information on how a company's pay policies might encourage too much risk-taking.\nSeparately, the agency voted unanimously to require thousands of investment advisers who have custody of clients' money to submit to annual surprise exams by outside auditors.\nThe surprise audits would allow independent accountants to review the books and verify that the money is there. The snap audits would apply to about 1,600 investment advisers that don't use third-party custodians, out of roughly 11,000 advisers registered with the SEC.\nThis move is aimed at plugging gaps that allowed disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff to deceive investors.\nThe expanded executive pay disclosure rules will take effect next spring, when companies send annual proxy disclosures to shareholders.\nThe changes will help investors make better-informed voting decisions for the companies in which they hold stock, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said.\n\"By adopting these rules, we will improve the disclosure around risk, compensation and corporate governance, thereby increasing accountability and directly benefiting investors,\" Schapiro said before the vote.\nBut Commissioner Kathleen Casey said she opposed some of the new requirements, such as added information on qualifications of directors and candidates for the board, that she said could be \"unduly burdensome.\"\nAs a result, Casey said she was voting against the rule as a whole.\nIt was the first final rule adopted by the SEC this year under Schapiro's tenure. Numerous proposals have been made by the commissioners.\n—Legal actions involving the company's executive officers, directors and nominees for the board.\n—The role played by diversity as a factor in choosing candidates for the board.\n—Potential conflicts of interest on the part of compensation consultants retained by the company.\nThe Obama administration imposed pay curbs on banks that received federal bailout money. Since then, eight of the largest such banks have either repaid or said they will repay their federal money, largely to escape caps on executive pay.\nThe Federal Reserve has set a February deadline for the 28 biggest U.S. banks — including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. — for submitting 2010 compensation plans. The Fed also will be encouraging, though not requiring, banks to revise this year's pay plans if they are out of step with principles the Fed has proposed to limit risk.\nAnger over lavish Wall Street pay has led some U.S. banks to take pre-emptive action. Goldman Sachs, for example, has said it won't give cash bonuses to 30 top executives. Instead, the bonuses will be paid in stock that can't be cashed in for five years.\nCompanies will have to disclose how pay is determined in departments involved in the riskiest activities — or departments that produce a big chunk of company profits.\nThe new requirements were proposed by the SEC and opened to public comment in July. They build on rules the agency adopted in 2006.\nUnder current rules, companies don't have to reveal the full value of stock options they give an executive. Instead, they must disclose in their annual proxy statements only the portion of an options award that vests that year.\nThe new rule will require companies to show in a summary table the estimated value of all stock-based awards on the day they are granted. The SEC's 2006 rules had relegated those totals to a separate table that investors often overlook or find hard to decipher.\nAn example is the case of a company that decides its CEO deserves $10 million worth of stock options, to vest in equal installments over four years. Under current rules, the company would have to include only $2.5 million — one-fourth of the total of the $10 million total — in the summary table."

        "text": "The black, glossy background in the Nike store took attention away from the brand's shoes.\nIn February, I visited Nike and Adidas' flagship stores in New York City.\nNike's displays were confusing, and the store didn't do enough to highlight the striking visuals that have always been one of the company's strengths.\nAdidas' design instincts were much better, and the store found a number of smart ways to allow customers to interact with products.\nThe rivalry between Nike and Adidas has been one of the top stories in athletic apparel for decades. While Nike has often landed bigger athletes for sponsorships, Adidas has surged in recent years by anticipating and responding to customer demand with stylish, versatile products that make sense for exercise or everyday use.\nNow, Nike is rethinking its retail approach in an attempt to keep Adidas from overtaking it as the top-selling athletic apparel company in the United States.\nI started at Niketown on 5th Avenue. Niketown was previously Nike's flagship store in New York City, but it closed in the spring and was replaced by a new store in November.\nThe first floor played to Nike's strengths.\nNike's acclaimed print and television ads have long played up its eye for striking visuals. Niketown's first floor reflected that skill set by highlighting images rather than products, creating excitement before customers even saw any merchandise.\nIt also promoted an inclusive, culturally relevant message. Nike's \"Equality\" ad campaign promoted diversity and tolerance.\nMost of the products shown on the first floor were inspired by that message. The items associated with the \"Equality\" campaign were some of the best I saw in the store.\nUnfortunately, the product displays (and many of the products themselves) on the other floors didn't quite live up to the hype. The store didn't have a consistent aesthetic, and many of the displays failed to highlight — and sometimes even detracted from — Nike's products.\nThe glossy black background on this display drew attention to its reflective qualities rather than the shoes.\nBasketball shoes have long been one of Nike's signature products, but Nike made some confusing decisions with its basketball shoe displays.\nPlacing a shoe off-center in the middle of a net-less basketball rim made the shoe line designed for LeBron James — perhaps Nike's most recognizable American athlete who isn't retired — look cheap rather than aspirational.\nIt didn't help that many of the shoes themselves were unattractive.\nIt would be difficult to make the raised, scale-like texture on Nike's \"Lebron 15\" shoe line look desirable in any environment. Considering the clout that Air Jordans still have with sneaker enthusiasts, it's surprising how badly Nike missed the mark with products associated with an athlete who will likely become one of the brand's most legendary icons.\nOne of Niketown's biggest problems was that it didn't consistently take advantage of Nike's best assets.\nThroughout its history, Nike has been able to land elite athletes for sponsorships more consistently than its competitors. But Niketown didn't do enough to highlight those athletes. This Lebron James display was a step in the right direction, but it wasn't reflected in the store's overall strategy.\nSome displays hinted at a strategy the store should have adopted.\nThis display for soccer shoes did a great job of creating an environment where the products could stand out, while complementing the products with eye-catching visuals of elite athletes. If Nike had applied this formula throughout the store, it may have been more compelling.\nBut more often than not, Nike wasted opportunities to show off the qualities that make it stand out from its competitors. I was drawn to the framed, black-and-white photos on each floor, but they were placed near the elevators and away from the merchandise.\nI went to Adidas' Fifth Avenue store next. Adidas opened the 45,000-square-foot store in December 2016.\nAdidas' flagship store also had a notable entrance. The Adidas store was designed with sports stadiums in mind, and the entrance was meant to look like the tunnel some athletes walk through before games. Like Niketown, the Adidas' store's entrance emphasized design over product.\nThe Adidas store had a more subtle and effective strategy for showing off its products, often placing shoes against walls with muted colors and using small, rectangular posters to separate the shoes into smaller groups that were easy to visually process.\nThe products were better, too. Adidas has gained an edge on competitors with its \"lifestyle running\" shoes, which are more stylish than the typical running shoe and are often worn as fashion accessories.\nNo matter their purpose, Adidas' shoes looked way better than anything Nike had to offer, often using sleeker designs, more sensible color schemes, and versatile textures that made sense for exercise and everyday use.\nThe store also highlighted the customer's ability to customize its products.\nThe second floor had a section that appealed to more creative types. Situated in the middle of the floor, the custom-design display wasn't intrusive, but it was obvious enough to draw the attention of a customer who might be interested in designing a custom shoe.\nCustomers could then make and order their own designs in the store.\nThe computers weren't quite as intuitive as they could be — they didn't indicate that users were supposed to scroll down at the beginning instead of clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the screen — but they were a smart way to engage customers who liked the brand's designs but weren't entirely satisfied with the color combinations available in the store.\nThe store also emphasized interactivity in creative ways.\nRather than only using a treadmill for customers who wanted to try out shoes (there was a treadmill available on the bottom floor), the second floor had a test track where customers could use clip-on sensors that would analyze their strides and allow salespeople to give them customized recommendations. The track was a smart way to encourage customers to reach out to salespeople, rather than the other way around.\nThe store allowed customers test out products in non-running contexts as well. On the bottom floor, a testing area with soccer balls and other sports equipment let customers get a sense of how products might work in sport-specific contexts.\nBetween the first and second floors, there were two sets of bleachers where people could watch sports while their friends, family members, or significant others shopped.\nBy integrating the bleachers into the staircase, they gave non-shoppers a place to hang out without getting in the way of customers.\nOverall, Adidas was the clear winner.\nI've preferred Nike to Adidas products for most of my life, so I was surprised by how impressed I was by the Adidas store. While it wasn't quite as flashy as its entrance indicated, it excelled where it mattered: in smart, carefully designed product displays and creative spaces where customers could test products in a wide variety of contexts. Add in the fact that Adidas has a significant edge on Nike in product design, and the result wasn't close.\nNike may still be the top-selling apparel brand in the US, but if it doesn't step up, Adidas could overtake it in the coming decades."

        "text": "Gaza is an open air prison where one and a half million people are deprived of adequate water, electricity, opportunities to farm, and the right to move about their own land or the world freely. Palestinian children are detained without charge for months and when charged, they are tried in military courts. Gazan schools are insufficient and the funds often cut. An Israeli museum is built over a centuries old Muslim graveyard. Ancient olive trees, the livelihood of Palestinian farmers are burned. Homes are bulldozed. A blockade prevents goods from coming into and out of Palestine, inhibiting commerce and the means for a livelihood. Water is diverted from its source directly to Israel where it is abundantly available, including for swimming pools, while Palestinians have to buy water from tanker trucks. (A Durham Presbyterian church funded water purifiers for Gaza schools after the bombing of U.N. schools.) The wall closing off Israel from Palestinians makes everyday life difficult. Israeli settlements take more land from Palestinians every year. Drones fly 24 hours a day spying on and frightening the residents of Gaza.\nThe asymmetry of the two sides is extreme. A few rockets a week fall into north Israel and if they hit an Israeli citizen, Israel attacks with an over-the-top force, killing hundreds of Palestinians. Palestinians have only stones, and now knives, to express their frustration and anger.\nThose who support Israel based on religious beliefs do not realize that Palestine Christians also suffer under the burden of the Israeli occupation. The Presbyterian Church of America, and The Episcopal Peace Fellowship have spoken out about the repression in their book and DVD called, “Steadfast Hope” for their parishioners. It is painful to watch and read.\nPalestinian student campus organizations face bureaucratic harassment, severe restrictions on and censorship of their columns, even cancellations of their speakers. If they do win the battle to publish their viewpoint, Jewish organizations immediately spring into action to overwhelmingly deny and refute their message.\nMovies, media and games perpetuate stereotypes with Palestinians depicted as terrorists and villains, vicious gunmen, wide-eyed maniacs killing anyone, anywhere, any time for any reason. Movies and television programs such as “Tyrant,” “Dig” and “Homeland” depict Arabs as the lowest of human beings.\nThis in contrast to positive portrayals of Israelis, such as Ziva David as a Mossad agent in “NCIS.” Europeans are speaking out about the Gaza tragedy, but American voices are silenced out of fear of being accused as anti-Semitic. A major conference, “The Israel Lobby: Is It Good for the US, Is It Good for Israel?” received no main stream media coverage.\nHow to get the message out? Jewish organizations inside Israel and the U.S. are working for peace and to let the world know of the suffering of the Palestinians. That is the message the protesters want to bring to the council and the public.\nEleanor Kinnaird is a former state senator and mayor of Carrboro."

        "text": "MURFREESBORO — I guess my older son’s mother and I always knew it would happen: college move-in day.\nI’d been noticing on Facebook where co-workers, friends and others had incoming freshmen moving into their dorm, and this past weekend, actually just a really long Saturday, it was our turn.\nMy son Jonathan is officially a Middle Tennessee State University freshman. He went down Saturday in one car and his parents in another.\n— Even with a GPS, things don’t always work out as planned. His mother and I headed down Interstate 81 and then I-40 toward Nashville. He ended up taking I-75 toward Chattanooga at the I-81 and I-40 split east of Knoxville. However, his phone GPS directed him a different way after his southern turn and he beat us there by at least 20 minutes.\n— If you travel with a gumball machine, don’t put the gumballs in until you get to your destination without a top on the machine. My ex’s rear floorboard was full of gumballs before we left Kingsport.\n— If you ever make a trip to Murfreesboro, when you make the exit off I-40 to I-840, be forewarned there are no gas stations until you reach Murfreesboro, about 22 miles. We realized this as the gas gauge was about on empty. On much of I-40 there are gas stations galore, often at every exit.\n— Once we got to Mufreesboro and then campus, we relied more heavily on GPS to guide us since we weren’t familiar with the campus or the city. After the third time of being directed to turn left onto Mount Sue Boulevard, I realized the GPS meant MTSU Boulevard. Hmm, Big Blue of Mount Sue? At least it rhymes.\n— Always check to be sure the dorm refrigerator works and have a checklist of items. After his refrigerator didn’t cool, he told me it had been about two years since the fridge had been used. As of last word, it was still not working. I guess a new fridge might be in his future unless he snags his sister Erica’s refrigerator from her old room at home. He also forgot his backpack and extra car key and remote but plans to get those, and maybe another fridge, when he visits here in September. He also didn’t take his 50-plus-inch television, at least yet.\n— Listen to the keynote convocation speech. This one was by attorney Bryan Stevenson, author of “Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption,” the freshmen summer reading selection. A black man who grew up on the proverbial wrong side of the tracks, he went to Harvard Law School and became a defender and champion of the downtrodden. He has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and is to do so again later this year.\nHe has spent his career fighting against racism, against other discrimination and for justice and for equality. His message was for the class of 2022 to become involved and try to make things better, to get up close and personal with people so they could make a difference just like an attorney needs to get to know about his clients before helping them.\nFunny, he didn’t say a thing about GPS pronunciations, spilled gumballs and not-so-cool refrigerators. Maybe there’s a book there? Future convocation keynote speech, here I come."

        "text": "When Thanksgiving preparations are concerned, I favor recipes that can be cooked ahead. The only thing I make on Thanksgiving day is the turkey. This avoids the situation where I'm so exhausted from cooking by the time my guests arrive that I can't enjoy their company. So bit-by-bit, during the past several weeks, I've been cooking and refrigerating or freezing all the other items on my menu.\nBeing an avid iDevice user, and a huge fan of recipes found on epicurious.com, I decided to focus my efforts to go paper-less, if not totally paper-free, on this combination of software and hardware. The Epicurious app, available for both Apple and Android devices, is free and has many useful features, including the ability to set up your own recipe box and create shopping lists that come in handy during trips to the grocery store – for example when I am trying to remember how many apples go into the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup. If you're looking to expand your repertoire, the app also gives you access to the full library of Epicurious recipes.\nI sprung for the upgrade ($1.99) that would keep these treasures in a culinary cloud and enable me to sync my recipe box across platforms – my iPhone, iPad and desktop computer.\nThe question was how well the app would import the “keepers,” which I have gleaned from a variety of sources.\nNot surprisingly, it worked best with recipes that originally came from Epicurious. The only keeper that actually falls into this category is a recipe I use for Thanksgiving leftovers – Moroccan Chicken Pot Pie, which for obvious reasons I make with turkey instead of chicken.\nImporting The New York Times recipe for Apple And Butternut Squash Soup was more cumbersome. It first required that I download the “Epi Clipper,” tool and drag it to the toolbar of my browser. This was easily enough accomplished on my desktop computer, though since the tool is powered by ZipList, I first had to enter a bunch of personal information and sign up for ZipList, which I would have preferred not to do. Nor, after a handful of attempts, was I able to install Epi Clipper on the browser of my iPad – this despite the fact that I am a reasonably tech-savvy person.\nThe next thing I discovered was that although it is now possible for me to access the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup recipe on my iDevices, what I get is just the recipe title and list of ingredients. For the full instructions I must click on a link that takes me to The New York Times website where the original recipe appeared. This is fine provided that you have Wi-Fi or a cellular data plan that works in your kitchen.\nAll this said, I did make the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup several weeks ago using the recipe on my iPad rather than on the very yellowed, water-stained original that I clipped from The New York Times in 1989 and have been referring to ever since. The soup can be made far an advance of Thanksgiving and frozen. When doing that, I don't add the half-and-half until I am ready to serve it.\nWith one exception, I have found this recipe is a crowd pleaser. My son eats it for breakfast, dunking toasted French bread in it. And I once delivered a quart of it to a neighbor after a sudden death in his family, and he told me it was great comfort food. But I will never forget the pain of watching a guest who obviously did not like this soup. He swirled it around in the bowl with his spoon, taking tiny mouthfuls, and washing them down with big gulps of water, until I swooped down and took the bowl right out from under his lifted spoon.\nAnother thing you need to know about this recipe is that although it is one of my keepers, it takes many hours to prepare. One guest who asked for the recipe later told me that she decided it was easier just to eat it at my house than to make it herself.\nIn my march (actually it was more of a crawl) towards a paper-less kitchen, I had less success with another New York Times recipe that is one of my Thanksgiving keepers: Cranberry-Pineapple Chutney, which by the way, can be made several weeks ahead and kept in a jar in your refrigerator. This recipe was part of a 1988 story, “Where Do Cranberries Come From, Anyway? The Answers.” When I used Epi Clipper, the only ingredient that appeared was a pinch of salt. I took this snafu with a grain of salt, entered the rest of the ingredients manually on my desktop, and then synced the Epicurious account on my iDevices.\nThe app was of no help with the various sources of instructions for cooking the perfect turkey. Trussing is critical to this effort, and I continue to rely on the diagram (it’s actually for trussing a chicken, but a turkey has the same basic anatomy) on pages 237-239 of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1, by Julia Child et al. (My copy of the book falls open to this page.) Other tips, from Bobby Flay, were originally published in the Nov. 22, 2002 issue of Newsweek, and are summarized here.\nAnother recipe that will not migrate to my iDevices is my grandmother’s famous noodle pudding. As a child, I used to help her make it. First she let me crush the Sugar Frosted Flakes that she used for topping. When I got older, I was promoted to the job of running the KitchenAid mixer as she added the eggs, sugar and other ingredients.\nI still have a yellow index card, written in an insecure adolescent’s script, with the recipe that she dictated to me. But a more cherished memento is a copy of the recipe in her own handwriting. She gave it to my sister-in-law, Lisa, welcoming her into our family. After Nanny (a name that stuck from the days when I couldn’t pronounce “Granny”) died, Lisa duplicated it and gave each family member a laminated copy.\nThe Epicurious app has a feature that would allow me to type the noodle pudding recipe into my electronic recipe box. But doing that would expel Nanny from my kitchen. And I wouldn’t dream of it."

That means I disbelieve in the whole ten thousand or so gods who have been held by some to be of utmost importance since hominids first stared at the stars and asked,\"Why?\"\nPeter Sellick only disbelieves in 9,999 or one less that I do.\nChristianity has only been around for 0.1% or less of the time which has elapsed since the first hominid started hunting for a living. We managed to survive without Christianity and domineering popes and other clerics for much of that time.\nIf they had their way we would go back to giving them the power over life and death as they had during the Inquisition and the Thirty Year War.\nAs Terry Lane said in a radio interview after writing \"God; The Interview\" all theologians make it up as they go along.\nPeter, I think you've explained the situation clearly. Unfortunately, apart from those who attack Christian faith from a scientistic (not merely scientific) viewpoint, there are also some within the church who don't understand that God is not supernatural.\nThe article is not about the institution but about some concepts central to Christian understanding. And I would suggest that the Christian path is about being fully human: far more than survival.\nI may be wrong, but you seem to be suggesting that God is simply constructed to explain the material world and the position of humans in it. I think that for many people the starting point of faith in God is not an intellectual effort to find a God to fill the gaps in knowledge. Rather it is an awareness, however faint, of the presence of God in their lives. The intellectual efforts to describe and understand this awareness become what we often call theology.\nSell, I think your whole argument falls down because the Christian church believes that God becaome flesh in the form of Jesus. This is an oxymoron if you wish to continue to believe in God as a spiritual being. He may be one or the other, but not both.\n\"there are also some within the church who don't understand that God is not supernatural.\"\nis an understatement. In a room of intellectually leaning church men and women I had the distinct feeling that I was the only one in the room that thought that God was not supernatural and who did not exist in the world as supernatural being. It seems that most of them wanted God to act somehow in the material world apart from the power of the Word in the Spirit. The providential God is alive and well!\nThank you Peter, for an interesting article.

        "text": "But those numbers are actually troubling. In contrast to our dominance in sports, African-American men make up less than 5 percent of all males enrolled in medical school. A recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges highlights that there actually was a slight decline in the number of black men applying to and enrolling in medical school from 1978 to 2014, a finding unique among all demographic groups. The numbers of black men in law, business, academia and engineering are also disproportionately low.\nThe AAMC report describes some of the persistent barriers: underperforming K-12 education, lack of positive role models, negative or limiting public perceptions of African-American men. For decades, any listing of prominent African-American men would almost exclusively contain athletes and other entertainers.\nThese perceptions all too often become reality. I grew up in the 1980s in a working-class black neighborhood near Washington where sports and entertainment framed our dreams. I can’t remember anyone aspiring to become an astronaut or engineer or a senator or governor. Many of us did play competitive sports in high school, and a handful made it to the college level (me included). But only one went to the pros; the rest had to face the reality of finding regular jobs. Some had serious struggles with this transition. While we encouraged one another to practice our jump shots and perfect the art of throwing and catching a football, spending more time on the education road would have surely been a better strategy.\nLet’s be honest, though. Becoming Barack Obama or Ben Carson is just as unlikely as becoming Michael Jordan or LeBron James. The difference is the process and where you’ll land if you fall short of their status. While going to law school (like Obama) or medical school (like Carson) isn’t likely to land you anywhere near the White House, it can lead to a very comfortable life. The average annual salary for a physician, which can be earned for 30 or 40 years, is over $200,000.\nPutting all of one’s efforts into sports has enabled the exceptional few to become rich while leaving the majority with resumés ill-suited to economic success. The best sports-related options for those who don’t become professional athletes (sports agent, front office executive, sportswriter or coach) usually require a college degree. Unlike our dominance on the field or court, African-American men – unless they are well-known former players – are far less likely to wind up in these ancillary positions.\nIt’s unfortunate that Obama and Carson are so polarizing – politics has a way of glamorizing and denigrating people all at once. The shortcomings in how they are perceived underscore the need for more black men to reach the highest levels of achievement in other fields – whether it is in science, communications or business/technology. In the meantime, let’s take a step back to acknowledge the important example that Obama and Carson offer to young black men.\nAnd while recent racial tensions at Duke, UNC and other colleges across America illuminate some of the challenges that black students can face in academic settings, education remains our best path toward long-term success. That’s a message that my sons, and every other young black male, can’t hear too much."

All learners should speak English or Afrikaans and an African language.\nOpenness: to stimulate children to think for themselves, to be open to new ideas and hungry for knowledge; a richer reading and debating culture needs to be nurtured.\nAccountability: in a climate where public perceptions about both schools and teachers are negative, teachers need to dedicate themselves to their profession and view it as a vocation. A fellowship between all those involved in education should ensure that “quality learning and teaching take(s) place”.\nI promise to be loyal to my country, South Africa, and to do my best to promote its welfare and the well-being of all of its citizens.

        "text": "It soon became apparent that Gov. Jerry Brown had insisted on having the reserve limit in the bill, which was a little surprising.\nIt not only defied common sense by potentially forcing local districts to spend down financial reserves against their will, but clearly violated Brown’s own oft-voiced principles of “subsidiarity” – leaving decisions in local hands – and building reserves as prudent hedges.\nIt was clearly a sop to the powerful California Teachers Association and other unions which might have otherwise opposed Proposition 2, which was to be the focal point of Brown’s re-election campaign.\nForcing districts to spend down reserves could potentially free money for salary negotiations. Thus, placing the reserve limit in SB 858 would, it appeared, persuade union leaders to not oppose Proposition 2’s passage and give them cover vis-à-vis their own members – even though it’s unlikely that conditions for invoking the limit will be met in the foreseeable future, and school officials could probably sidestep it with creative budget-writing.\nAs the Legislature reconvened this week, the California School Boards Association demanded repeal of the limit, citing a study saying it could force districts to spend as much as $17 billion, including emergency reserves, against their better judgment.\n“This is bad law and needs to be repealed,” the group’s president, Josephine Lucey, declared.\nIt may have been an acceptable tradeoff to Brown, ever the pragmatist willing to set aside even his principles when political exigencies intrude. But it’s still bad public policy and he has dropped hints that with Proposition 2 now passed, he might entertain repealing or modifying it.\nHowever, a Brown flip-flop, if it happens, would make the whole episode look even more cynically manipulative and would also present a political dilemma for the unions."

This event is all about acknowledging the important work underway in Ireland thanks to the support of the HRB. There’s a fascinating mix of research projects on display here which really brings home the difference that good research can make to individual patients.\nThe impact of the facilities and networks are evident already. For example, Ireland was at the forefront in testing Oncotype DX, a genetic diagnostic that helps women and their doctors determine the best course of individualised treatment in breast cancer and which helps patients avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.\nIreland also led a trial which examined 1,100 babies experiencing growth restriction in the womb. The study changed international guidelines when it found that intervention to prevent serious health complications for a small baby in the womb is only required for those in the bottom 3% from a weight perspective, not the bottom 10% as previously thought. This is improving survival rates and outcomes for small babies, reducing stress among mothers-to-be and ensuring effective use of health service time and resources.\n* What does the HRB Clinical Research Infrastructure entail?\nThree HRB Clinical Research Facilities on hospitals grounds in Dublin, Galway and Cork where, to date, more than 10,000 people are participating in clinical trials. These facilities provide the physical space, facilities, expertise and culture needed to support patient-focused research studies and clinical studies aimed at understanding a range of diseases and translating the knowledge obtained through this research work into regulatory approved advances in patient care as fast as possible.\nThe Wellcome-HRB CRF in Dublin also houses the HRB Centre for Advanced Medical Imaging (CAMI). This is the only 3 Tesla MRI scanner dedicated to research in Ireland and plays a crucial role in a wide range of studies from breast cancer to dementia.\nFive HRB Clinical Trial Networks in the specialties of Primary Care, Stroke, Cancer** Perinatal Care and Critical Care which will show whether specific interventions work, or indeed don’t work. **This is the cancer clinical trial network funded with the Irish Cancer Society for many years now – the All-Ireland Cooperative Oncology Research Group (ICORG).\nHRB Trials Methodology Research Network which will strengthen the approach taken to trials and the way they are reported in health and social care so they are relevant, accessible and influential for patients, other service users, practitioners, policy makers and the public.\nHRB Clinical Research Coordination Ireland a ‘hub’ which will coordinate Ireland’s involvement in clinical trials, promote our network internationally and increase our capacity to successfully deliver multicentre trials led by Irish or international investigators."

        "text": "FILE — Michael Larobina, Director of Legal Affairs.\nSTAMFORD -- Director of Legal Affairs Michael Larobina defended his handling of legal issues related to the ongoing ethics proceedings and explained the city's settlement with former Board of Finance Chairman Joe Tarzia during a meeting with city representatives last week.\nLarobina appeared before the Board of Representatives Legislative and Rules Committee on April 25 to explain the February arrangement that resulted in Tarzia's abrupt resignation from public office. Tarzia, first elected to the Board of Finance in 1987, had been battling several ethics violation charges at the time of his departure.\nOne charge, filed by Human Resources Generalist Tania Barnes in April 2010, alleged Tarzia asked two city employees, Director of Operations Ernie Orgera and Parks Superintendent Mickey Docimo, to intervene in the disciplining of a vehicle maintenance worker.\nAnother complaint, filed by City Fleet Manager Michael Scacco, alleged Tarzia, along with City Rep. Sal Gabriele, R-16, and Republican finance board member Bob Kolenberg, \"led a campaign of harassment and retaliation\" against him after he attempted to discipline city equipment mechanic James Fasoli.\nThe city's deal with Tarzia ended public ethics hearings on the complaints. The arrangement was a settlement of a federal lawsuit Tarzia had filed against the city in October 2010, Larobina said.\nAn ethical dilemma: Who should pay?\nTarzia was paid $45,000 in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, resigning from municipal office, and withdrawing all ethics complaints and Freedom of Information requests he had filed.\n\"In my mind, it was simply a question of stemming the hemorrhaging of taxpayer dollars to defend and pay legal fees to outside counsel to defend this frivolous lawsuit, that, in our opinion had no merit,\" Larobina said. \"The decision was that we would spend more money litigating and defending this suit than we would to settle it. And we do that every day. We settle lawsuits every day.\"\nCommittee Chair Eileen Heaphy asked Larobina how much money he estimated the settlement saved taxpayers.\n\"I'm sure that we would have expended at least twice or three times the amount of what we paid out in legal fees,\" Larobina said. \"The case really hadn't gone very far at that point. We spent a significant amount of money.\"\nA breakdown of the more than $130,000 Stamford has spent on legal fees related to the past year's ethics proceedings shows the city paid the Law Office of Byelas & Neigher $42,390 for legal representation related to the federal lawsuit, in addition to the $45,000 settlement. It also spent an estimated $30,000 on legal fees incurred by the Board of Ethics in connection with the complaint filed against Tarzia and Kolenberg.\nArthur Layton, the committee vice chair, asked Larobina if the settlement stipulated Tarzia could not run for municipal office again or speak adversely about the city following his resignation. Larobina said the agreement did not include these requirements.\nCity Rep. Jay Fountain, D-7, asked about the status of the ethics complaints filed against Tarzia. Larobina said they had been withdrawn.\n\"Contrary to what some people have suggested, if you look at the ordinance, the Board of Ethics only has what we call in the law jurisdiction over individuals if they are a city employee, officer or elected official,\" Larobina said. \"Once you cease to become one of those things, the board has no jurisdiction over you.\"\nThe Stamford Code of Ethics section on \"continuing investigations,\" however, gives the Board of Ethics jurisdiction to pursue ethics inquiries even after the person in question has left a position with the city.\n\"If an officer or employee under investigation leaves office or employment, the Board by a majority vote shall have the power to continue the investigation,\" the Code says.\nHeaphy said she was glad Larobina clarified the circumstances surrounding the settlement.\n\"I think that the important thing was getting it on the record and in the open,\" she said. \"I think they did a fair and honest job with it. They came to a conclusion that saved the city a lot more problems, so I have to say that was wise on their part.\"\nCity Rep. Harry Day, R-13, said he was happy with Larobina's explanation.\n\"I'm a lawyer also and if I had been in Mike's shoes, I would have done exactly what he did,\" Day said. \"It was a deal that was premised on here we are, and let's just resolve where we are. It didn't look back, it didn't look forward. It just resolved what was in front of them.\"\nLarobina also answered questions from committee remembers regarding his department's stance on providing legal representation to city officials accused of ethics violations. Last spring, the city paid $3,000 for an attorney for Tarzia before deciding he would be responsible for his own legal fees unless he was cleared of the ethics charges against him.\n\"Initially Mr. Tarzia made a demand for his legal representation to be paid by the city,\" Larobina said. \"Our initial position was that we would do that. Upon my insistence, I gathered the senior attorneys in the law department and asked for further research on this matter.\"\nLarobina said he spent four or five hours researching the issue with three other attorneys in his office. They concluded the city was not legally obligated to provide upfront legal representation for city officials accused of ethics violations.\n\"We made a decision to change course,\" he said. \"Practicing attorneys do this all the time. You take a position, you do further research, you reflect and you decide that you're going to go in a different direction.\"\nCity Rep. John Zelinsky, D-11, said he was concerned volunteer elected officials would be deterred from serving on Stamford boards and commissions if they felt they could be liable for large legal expenses.\n\"What's to stop somebody from filing an ethics complaint against anybody.... and we have to go out and retain an attorney to defend us possibly in a suit that really has no merit?\" Zelinsky said.\nLarobina said the issue would need to be taken up with the state Legislature.\n\"As your legal representation, let me tell you what your options are,\" he said. \"You need to address this with the Connecticut General Assembly. Those are your options.\"\nBoard of Ethics Chair Dan Young said Wednesday he intends to address the subject at Thursday's meeting, which will be held in part to discuss possible recommendations for improvements to the ethics code.\n\"I don't know what other board members will think, but I intend to raise the issue of whether we should recommend to the Board of (Representatives) that they make a rule about when/whether participants get their attorneys' fees paid for,\" Young said in an email.\nThursday's Board of Ethics meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Board of Representatives, legislative chambers at the Government Center. It is open to the public.\nStaff Writer Kate King can be reached at kate.king@scni.com or at 203-964-2263."

        "text": "The world of technology, particularly medical technology, tends to be consumed with making us superhuman. It wants to enhance our abilities and prolong our lives, if not enable us to live forever. But new innovations give rise to new and tough choices, and a small but growing group of startups sees it as their mission to use technology, not to extend life, but to help people make and document some of the most difficult decisions regarding the end of it.\nThe story of a patient from her days as a student at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine particularly haunts Azalea Kim, co-founder of the startup TrueNorth. A 60-year-old woman, who had terminal cancer, came to the emergency room one weekend evening in dire condition. Because of a complicated family situation, Kim said, she arrived alone, without any family member to serve as an advocate and describe the kind of care she would want.\nAlthough her medical record was overflowing with documentation, the doctors were unable to locate a health care proxy form that could also have provided guidance on the kind of procedures the woman would – and wouldn’t – have wanted in her final days. So, Kim explained, the doctors slipped into default mode, administering intravenous therapy, sending her to a radiologist, considering a surgical intervention and providing all kinds of aggressive and potentially unwanted care.\nPartly motivated by that experience, Kim and two Harvard Business School classmates, Margaret Terry and Amy Flaster, launched TrueNorth. A recent graduate of the Healthbox startup accelerator in Boston, TrueNorth provides a free online service for patients to record their legal healthcare proxy (or power of attorney) and then share it with loved ones and healthcare providers.\nThe goal, the founders said, is for TrueNorth to encourage patients to tackle difficult end-of-life decisions and ultimately integrate with electronic medical record systems to make these forms available in the health and emergency contexts in which they’re needed.\nA planning tool on MyDirectives prompts patients to indicate their preferences and values related to end-of-life care.\nAnd it’s one of a handful of relatively new startups trying to use technology to help patients think through and share their end of life decisions. For example, along with TrueNorth, the Dallas-based MyDirectives exclusively offers support around health-related decisions, while startups Everplans and AfterSteps focus on medical planning services, along with a wider range of financial and legacy planning options.\nAccording to Kim, just 25 percent of patients have documented a health care proxy or living will. And, other estimates indicate that even when a document exists, it can’t be located 35 percent of the time. These companies say their digital tools help ensure that patients’ voices are heard when they’re at their most vulnerable or can no longer speak for themselves.\nFor example, they can walk patients through their end-of-life prioritizes, enabling them to indicate that they most value being free from pain or not being a burden to their families. They also let patients specify the circumstances in which they’d want life-sustaining treatment, like heart machines and dialysis.\nAnd their rise makes sense given the growth of the so-called “longevity economy” of services for the aging Baby Boomer demographic, increasing awareness among patients that they need to be more proactive about their health and the digitization of healthcare — not to mention major advances in medical technology.\nAs a study from the Pew Internet & American Life pointed out earlier this month, nearly 40 percent of American adults are caring for another adult or child with a serious illness. And, a big chunk of those adults are part of the workforce. According to MyDirectives, caregiving-related expenses cost employers $17 to $33 billion a year in lost productivity (canceled meetings, delayed product launches, etc.) and an additional $11 billion in healthcare costs because caregivers suffer from stress, depression and other conditions.\nFor end-of-life care companies, that means there’s an opportunity in targeting employers with a service that lets them improve care for their employees while hopefully contributing to productivity. For health plans, the pitch is that these services could help them attract and retain customers. And, in an era of rising healthcare costs, these services could also reduce the number of unwanted and often expensive procedures – an amount some experts peg at $6 billion a year.\nThat this topic isn’t exactly uplifting is not lost on these companies – Jeff Zucker, co-founder and CEO of MyDirectives acknowledged that many people don’t realize the ramifications of not having end-of-life documentation or just don’t want to deal with it. But he said his hope is that his company, which started its work in 2007 and launched its service last year, can help people think of end-of-life planning as a way to take control of their circumstances, minimize suffering and honor a person’s life.\nImage by racorn via Shutterstock.\nAnother great use of technology – I was not aware of these end of life apps/software but they seem like they would be incredibly useful (providing all health care providers would have easy access to them, of course!).\nI am the manager of HealthWorks Collective, the healthcare website in the Social Media Today network. I would love to repost this article for our readers. We have a series on Health Start-Ups and I think this would be a great addition. I would create a profile for you on our site and credit you as author, and would also link the post back to the original on gigacom. Please let me know if this is OK.\nI can’t help but wonder if there isn’t a gray area that medical staff would consider intrusive or extreme and a family member would have considered it to be an option that may have extended the life of a loved one.\nDoes TrueNorth have an actual product available on the market right now? Plenty of nice problem statements on their site, but no screenshots or descriptions of the actual product. Iâ€™m unclear as to whether itâ€™s something I could proactively use as a patient vs. something a doctor would advise me to use.\nDoes TrueNorth have an actual product available on the market right now?

        "text": "October 6, 2011 (JUBA) - South Sudan said Wednesday that the ongoing food crisis in the newly independent country could develop into a famine if no immediate remedies are taken.\nJoseph Lual Acuil, South Sudan’s minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management told a weekly media briefing in Juba that “lower harvests due to unreliable rains coupled with the rising food prices world-wide, have created a severe food shortage leaving more than 1.3 million in need of food aid.\"\nAs of September 26 the UN estimate that 342,000 South Sudanese have returned to the country since last autumn, many of whom require food aid. In July South Sudan seceded from the north following a referendum in January.\nThe minister said that the greater Equatoria region had been the worst effected by the late rains this year. Insecurity, returnees from north Sudan and newly displaced people from the contested region Abyei and Jonglei state have all added to the food crisis.\nAcuil said his ministry has attempted to address the problem by sending aid to Agok in Northern Bahr el Ghazal where many of the 110,000 people displaced from Abyei and its surrounding areas are residing.\n“I just spoken to the chief administrator and he confirmed arrival of some of the trucks\", the minister said.\nFlash floods in Agok in early September \"compounded an already difficult situation for people displaced by conflict in Abyei in May this year\" a recent UN report said.\n\"Food insecurity of the affected households continued to be of concern as the people displaced from Abyei are largely dependent on food assistance\" the September 26 report found.\nThe minister also said that food aid was also being sent to Uror county in Jonglei State, where fighting in August killed around 600 people and displaced over 20,000, the UN estimates.\n\"The people at ‘severe risk’ may either not have enough food to eat, enough money to buy seed to plant or enough money to buy food. The prices are increasing almost every hour. I am in Wau, Western Bahr el Ghazal, nobody can get food at eleven o’clock in the morning because people queue up at the restaurant and other local hotels for food”, the minister added.\nIn many parts of the Republic of South Sudan, he said, food prices have gone up due drought and the closure of supply routes with north Sudan after partition. The situation is especially bad in the areas closest to the border with Sudan.\nAn agreement between North and South Sudan to create ten points for trade and for people to move between the two countries has yet to be implemented.\nMinister Acuil said his government was working with donors to invest in irrigation systems to increase crop production.\n\"Urgent action is needed to prevent a looming humanitarian and food crisis in this country\", said Acuil.\nHe added that more than 11,000 people returning to South Sudan are in Renk awaiting transportation, explaining that local resources have been overstretched.\nIn order to address the food shortages the United Nations World Programme (WFP) is helping South Sudan’s government by constructing new roads to improve humanitarian access and allow agriculture goods to be brought to market.\nLakes state Governor Chol Tong Mayay, speaking at the inauguration of two roads being built in Rumbek East County, pledged unconditional support and cooperation of his administration to facilitate humanitarian operations in the area.\nThe two new roads link local farmers to markets marking the beginning of a three-year partnership between the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the South Sudan Ministry of Transport to build a total of 500 kilometres of feeder roads to help boost agriculture development.\nThe two roads, totaling 114 km, will connect the villages of Karich with Amok Piny and Aluakluak with Akuoc Cok, providing farmers with better access to markets. The project is being carried out in close cooperation with the Ministry for Roads and Bridges and local government authorities.\n“We are proud to be starting the construction of this road, which will connect food producers to markets and will connect isolated communities,” said Mayay, in a statement sent to Sudan Tribune.\nSpeaking to Sudan Tribune on Wednesday in Juba, Lydia Stone, a senior WFP staff member explained that road construction is a key part of WFP’s support to South Sudan to enable the nascent country to overcome some of the obstacles to developing agriculture.\n“Feeder roads link areas with high agricultural potential to trunk roads and will provide farmers with easier access to markets for their crops, thereby stimulating production and trade”, she said.\nIn the statement Kuoi Maluach, the chief of Paloich, one of the remote villages connected by the new road said: “We suffer from insecurity and a lack of services. If a woman is having trouble giving birth, we have to transport her to the clinic by bicycle. The road will change everything. It will give us access to trade and services”.\nStone said Chris Nikoi, WFP’s new country director, plans to build 500 km of feeder roads throughout South Sudan, especially in areas with high food production.\nShe named Western Equatoria as one of the states WFP plans to help the government construct feeder roads to facilitate local farmers access markets with their produce.\nThe two roads in Rumbek East are being built with funding from the South Sudan Recovery Fund. WFP has contracted the German organization GIZ to undertake the construction works which will be completed by July 2012. To ensure the long life of the feeder roads, local authorities and communities are being trained in road maintenance. Since 2004, WFP has repaired 2,600 km of trunk road, linking eight out of the ten state capitals and connecting South Sudan to Uganda and Kenya via four different routes.\nThe two feeder roads are being constructed as part of the Lakes State Stabilisation Programme, a joint UN programme under the ownership of the government of South Sudan. The programme aims to show the benefits of peace and encourage the participation and empowerment of communities affected by conflict and poverty.\nCustomers in Unity state have told Sudan Tribune reporter Bonifacio Taban Kuich that the cost of some basic food products have doubled since South Sudan became independent in July.\nTraders and retailers say that they are not to blame for the increase in prices of food and other goods due to the long distances they have to travel and the increase in fuel prices. Landlocked South Sudan has to import almost all of its food and other goods including petrol.\nDespite being an oil producing country South Sudan has no refinery or processing plant so it has to send its oil to be exported through North Sudan. Juba accuses Khartoum of the blocking the world’s newest international border forcing price rises especially in border states like Unity. In September the two countries agreed to establish ten entry check points in order to facilitate the movement for goods and people.\nAfter South Sudan’s secession many traders from North Sudan returned to the North leaving locals to step in to fill the gap. Women in Rubkotna town have taken over businesses from Darfuri traders including vegetable sales.\nOne of the women, Nyayang Nhial, said a bundle of ground okra that cost 1 South Sudanese Pound (SSP) two months ago now costs 2 SSP.\n\"Before the local perfumes cost 20 SSP but now reached up to 50 SSP\", said Nhial who started working in 2005 after her husband died in a car accident.\nCustomers told Sudan Tribune that almost everything in the market had doubled in price.\nViviana Philip, a customer at the market said she cannot afford to feed her family properly. Items like slippers have risen from 10 SSP to 25 SSP over the last two months, she said while asking the government to intervene.\nLocal butcher Latjor Wiyoak said that meat prices have also increased from 10 SSP to 12 SSP a kilo. He said traders had been forced into the price hike as otherwise they would make a loss.\nBusinesses in South Sudan face many challenges. Poor roads and insecurity make it difficult to move goods around the county and river transport can take weeks.\nAs most traders in South Sudan were from the North before independence many South Sudanese are not as experienced at importing goods from abroad which inevitably involves using much sort-after hard currency.\nPresident Salva Kiir of South Sudan announced this week that he would hold a meeting with his northern counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir on the issue of price rises and rampant inflation.\nStops issuing these stark warnings and get down to the real business of picking it so urgently. It’s too dires now, and will eventually be too diaboblical if you guys failed to addressed it cause now rather later.\nThis is a man-made drought so, the government of South Sudan should take the case to the International Court at Hague against the Global Pollutors Europe, USA, Russia, China, India and Australia. Although there are others, these mentioned countries are the major Pollutors and must be held accountable for loss of Rain in Africa.\nthe should start doing something before this particular cost of living shooting high and rocket the sky. it is the government responsibility to address the food prices before it is deteriorate. failure to address it will lead into disaster.\nSurprise! Our government did not see this coming! Instead of making food security the number one priority, guess what did it do, it made the relocation of the capital city an important matter. What a bunch of mindless people!\nI fully agree with the statement attibuted to the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs about the looming famine in South Sudan if urgent intervention measures were not taken. The issue had already been raised. What I do not seem to understand is Minister’s claim that \" greater Equatoria region had been the worst effected by the late rains this year\" is not in accord with the facts. Plse crosscheck.\nThe recent Rapid Cros Assessment (RCA) indicates that the only states which were better off in terms of food secuirty were the three states in Greater Equatoria. The Minister therefore has to crosscheck his information so that any intervention has to address the trully food insecure population."

        "text": "The bullpen collapsed again as the Diamondbacks lost for the 13th time in the past 19 games.\nDENVER – The cast has changed for the Diamondbacks, only they keep playing out the same tired script, one brutal night after another. In a deathly quiet visitors’ clubhouse, players sat motionless in front of their lockers late Wednesday night, seemingly stunned by the realization that their misery could reach new depths.\nYoshihisa Hirano, only recently given the reins in the closer’s role, became the latest Diamondbacks reliever to get beat in excruciating fashion, serving up D.J. LeMahieu’s opposite-field, walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth of a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.\nThe Diamondbacks were two outs away from shaving their deficit in the National League West to just 1 1/2 games. Instead, it could grow to 4 1/2 games by the time they leave town on Thursday evening.\nHanded a 4-3 lead in the ninth, Hirano allowed a leadoff single to Gerardo Parra, a hard-hit ball that first baseman Paul Goldschmidt could not handle, and, two batters later, Hirano left a fastball over the plate that LeMahieu smacked into the right-field seats.\nThey did get a lead. They did get a solid outing from lefty Patrick Corbin. And they did get good relief work through the eighth inning. But while the ninth was a disaster, the Diamondbacks’ offense once again gave the pitching staff little breathing room.\nWith one out in the fourth, Alex Avila launched a solo home run to center field to extend the Diamondbacks’ lead to 4-2. It was the last baserunner the Diamondbacks would have, as the Rockies retired 17 consecutive batters through the end of the game.\nRockies relievers recorded 15 of those outs, marking the first time in the franchise’s 25-year history the bullpen recorded five perfect innings.\nIt was the eighth consecutive game decided by one run that the Diamondbacks have lost. This season, they’re just 18-28 in one-run games.\nBut the Diamondbacks’ recent misery is not limited to one-run games. Nineteen games ago, they were a first-place team. But their 6-13 stretch has resulted in a five-game swing in the standings, with the Diamondbacks now sitting in third place with 16 games remaining.\nParra smoked the first pitch he saw from Hirano on one hop to Goldschmidt. It came off his bat at 98 mph, and Goldschmidt tried to play the ball to his left on a short hop. He couldn’t do so cleanly.\nAfter a Charlie Blackmon sac bunt, LeMahieu hit a 1-1 fastball, a pitch that Hirano wanted down and away but instead went up and over the plate.\n“It got away and it was kind of up where he could hit it,” Hirano said, speaking through interpreter Kelvin Kondo.\nIt was the eighth time the Diamondbacks’ bullpen had suffered a loss in the past 15 games."

Harry is followed closely by the Queen, with 74 percent, and Prince William, who is third with 73 percent of respondents saying they have a favorable view of him.\nHarry is described by his fans as “admirable, likable, humorous, fun-loving, and genuine,” the YouGov survey said.\nPrince Charles, who celebrates his 70th birthday tomorrow, comes seventh in the poll. His brother Prince Andrew is the least popular royal, ranked 15th in the survey.\nDespite their constant presence in the media and ease with audiences, both Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle came in behind their spouses in the poll, ranked fourth and sixth, respectively. (Meghan came in behind Prince Philip, who has retired from public life, though he might have decades of royal life to boost him there.) It’s not the only poll in which Kate has recently out-ranked her sister-in-law; another recent survey found that Kate remains the most influential royal when it comes to fashion.\nThe Queen, the country’s longest reigning monarch, is traditionally voted the most popular member of the royal family, but 2018 has been an epic year for Prince Harry, whose global popularity was on vivd display during his and Meghan’s recent South Pacific tour. Only 7 percent of those surveyed had a negative opinion of Harry while 13 percent had a neutral one. 20 percent had a negative view of Prince Charles, and 30 percent percent had a neutral opinion."

Vasquez, 24, of the 100 block of Paw Paw Avenue in Cortland, would remain jailed without bond. The DeKalb County State’s Attorney’s Office has asked that Vasquez be denied bond, and a hearing on that request is set for 9 a.m. April 23.\nVasquez was charged with attempted murder and armed violence, aggravated domestic battery and aggravated battery causing bodily harm. If convicted of attempted murder, he could face up to 30 years in prison.\n“If there is a finding of severe bodily injury, you’d serve your sentence at 85%,” Montgomery told Vasquez, who appeared during the bond call via closed-circuit video.\nMontgomery also ordered that Vasquez have no contact with his father.\nVasquez, who had been hospitalized since the incident, was arrested at 3 p.m. Tuesday at Northwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital. He is also charged with criminal damage to property.\nFirst responders were dispatched to the area around 9:45 p.m. Saturday, police have said. A man, later identified as Ricardo Vasquez, Ricardo A.G. Vasquez’s father, ran to a neighbor’s home and asked them to call for help. Upon arrival, police learned the father had been stabbed.\nAccording to court records, Ricardo A.G. Vasquez stabbed his father twice in the chest with an 11-inch knife. Vasquez also used a ball joint separater tool to damage his father’s car.\nPolice said in court records that he broke the windshield and made several dents in the 2003 Nissan’s body.\nThe father was taken to OSF St. Anthony Hospital in Rockford with serious injuries. The nursing supervisor on call Tuesday evening at St. Anthony’s said that he was no longer in the ICU and not listed on her patient sheet.\nVasquez is currently on probation for an earlier felony conviction stemming from an incident in Sycamore, according to DeKalb County court records. In October 2016, he was charged with aggravated battery to a pregnant woman, domestic battery and battery to an unborn child.\nPolice said Vasquez admitted to trying to punch his pregnant girlfriend in the abdomen during an argument over her plans to take their 4-month-old child and leave him. Vasquez pleaded guilty in October 2018 and was sentenced to two years of probation and a domestic violence prevention class in that case, records show."

When she hears that performer Cassie Cassava (American Idol finalist Melinda Doolittle) is coming back home to sing in her church’s Easter service, Marlee contrives to steal the singer for her own program. She’s just trying to help her fellow “Crispers.” A big production needs a big star, right? But of course, nothing ever goes as planned. When disaster strikes, will Marlee’s big dreams disintegrate? Will she discover what will truly help others? What is Easter really all about?\nAs Marlee struggles with the collapse of her theatrical dream, her friends gather around to encourage her and point her in the direction of Easter’s true significance. She thinks “bigger” means “more important,” that good drama needs flash and show. But she learns that Easter’s message of forgiveness and hope doesn’t need a big spectacle. Jesus “came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” The message from Mark 10:45 resounds throughout the story.\nThis newest Easter-themed VeggieTales show (the first since 2004) features Bob the Tomato as the good-hearted but slightly grumpy Pastor Erwin, Mr. Luntz as the slightly crazed robot rabbit creator, and the rest of the usual Veggies as townspeople and singers. The music, always funny and clever, is better than ever. Because Cassie is coming to sing in an Easter church service, she and the choir naturally belt out gospel tunes heavy on soul. Doolittle showcases her talent through Cassie, adding a delightful new character to the Veggie family.\nBig Idea Entertainment is using the launch of this DVD to partner with World Vision. The DVD includes a short promotional video with a special message from Bob and Larry on the opportunities for child sponsorship. Also releasing in conjunction with the DVD is a special music CD, VeggieTales: Hosanna! Today’s Top Worship Songs For Kids!, featuring award-winning artists Amy Grant and Casting Crowns’ Mark Hall.\n‘Twas the Night Before Easter contrasts the popular sentiment that “bigger is better” with the gospel truth that Jesus’ sacrificial death and resurrection is our true source of hope. The writers did not flinch from including direct references to Scripture and the Bible’s themes of hope and salvation. In this VeggieTale, the gospel message shines bright and clear."

        "text": "In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It’s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It’s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme.\nYet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles. It’s a brand that looks art directed by your 65-year-old parents who bought some no-name Android smartphone, hired based upon their portfolio of blurry photos on Facebook.\nIndeed, transparency strategy that’s been working for Domino’s since it started critiquing its own product in a 2010 reformulation and apology tour. Domino’s admitted that its food was failing taste tests and disappointing consumers, and it promised to embrace more legible ingredients. Sales at Domino’s continue to climb in the U.S. while industry-leader Pizza Hut’s drop. One forecast projects Domino’s taking Pizza Hut’s No. 1 spot by the end of the year. And though it has fewer followers than the Hut, Domino’s routinely gets more likes on Instagram and Twitter. In the world of big pizza, this unlikely approach is outmaneuvering the competition, including peers like Papa John’s and Little Caesar’s.\nBut let us be clear about something when it comes to Domino’s social feeds. It’s not just full of realistic photography without a food stylist on the set. It’s often downright gross bro-food, like what you might see waking up at 5 a.m. on the floor of a frat house.\nWe’re talking about grease-stained boxes, mozzarella cheese that has a white balance set to the color of earwax (17,000 likes).\nWe’re talking about garlic knots that resemble lovingly shaped micro-penises (8,500 likes).\nHere’s a twist you didn’t see coming! Introducing BREAD TWISTS, pizza’s newest best friend.\nWe’re talking about congealed chicken wings sitting in a pool of lukewarm buffalo sauce (8,000 likes).\nWe’re talking about using a flash to photograph food (10,000 likes).\nThis pizza’s hot in more ways than one.????????????\nThe Domino’s feed is not appetizing by any objective measure. But if you look at it long enough, over enough time, the cadence of grotesqueness begins to sink in. The studio lighting and Photoshop-enhanced pepperoni of Papa John’s and Pizza Hut start to look like the culinary equivalent of a French manicure and a spray tan. Fake.\nInstead of employing professional photographers, Domino’s relies on its digital marketing team to update the social media feeds. The cinema verité approach began in 2012, when Domino’s launched the Show Us Your Pizza Campaign, and shared the (often ugly) food photos taken by its customers. After that, the aesthetic just stuck. And today, the pizzas Domino’s photographs are all real, either pulled from a test kitchen oven, or delivered by an employee, no food stylist required. And, clearly, there’s no sweating the need for natural light or perfect post-processing by Domino’s employees who will sometimes even take photographs in their own suburban homes. Domino’s is a living embodiment of a #nofilter brand.\nOf course, this approach doesn’t just buck social media trends; it bucks everything established by fast food (or what the industry calls QSR) restaurants. Consider the low-angled Greek god stature with which McDonald’s has photographed its Big Macs over the years. The bun is a golden mountain. The seeds upon it are alabaster gems. And somehow, as if through consumer X-ray vision, you can even make out the pickles, beef, lettuce, and special sauce within their perfectly balanced stack. These foods have always been photographed as icons, so carefully presented that no minimum wage employee working during the lunch rush could ever live up to the promise. And yet as consumers, we continue to fall for the bait and switch again and again.\nIn theory, Domino’s will only drive more loyalty with every person who sees a deflated pile of cheese sticks on its feed and orders them in real life, because Domino’s is delivering on its promise. And in the age of the unicorn-colored influencer, when nothing we see in social media is really all that real, perhaps society is using Domino’s to self-administer its own antidote, one soggy slice at a time.\nFor now, Domino’s plans to stay the course with its approach to food photography. Maloney suspects that Domino’s will soon have competitors on Grosstagram, and as implausible as that may sound in today’s influencer space, perhaps it’s true. For as much as we’re all hooked on social media, more and more, we seem to be reaching a societal tipping point of understanding that what we see online isn’t actually all that real. And for a brand that wants to connect with its customers in an earnest way? Maybe admitting that is the first step."

        "text": "The final chapter in Roy Andersson's droll trilogy'on being a human being' introduces three dozen more brilliantly absurd vignettes.\nIn a Venice Film Festival lineup full of cynicism, suicide and despair, who would expect the new Roy Andersson picture — “the final part of a trilogy on being a human being” — to be the most life-affirming? And yet, from its comic title to the wistful smile that accompanies its over-too-soon last shot, Andersson’s delightfully odd “A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence” finds the Swedish master of comic absurdity feeling downright generous, perched at a comfortable enough distance from this coterie of sad sacks and lonelyhearts to recognize the humor in such painful subjects as mortality, aging, unpaid debts and unrequited love.\nJust last year, Ethan Hawke was quoted as referring to “Before Sunrise” and its two sequels as “the lowest-grossing trilogy in the history of motion pictures.” But even he probably hasn’t bought tickets to Andersson’s incomparable triptych — rapturously received by critics, though audiences have proven all but allergic to the first two films, which have cleared barely $100,000 so far in the U.S. The result of four years of rigorous planning and meticulous execution, “Pigeon” could fare slightly better than “Songs From the Second Floor” and “You, the Living” (both of which bowed at Cannes), but only just. At least arthouse programmers can now get creative, treating Andersson’s now-complete tragicomic opus, a decade and a half in the making, as the special event that it is.\n“Pigeon” is by far the most accessible of the three films, offering a continuity throughline in the form of novelty salesmen Sam (Nils Westblom) and Jonathan (Holger Andersson), a comedic duo who’d be right at home in a Samuel Beckett or Tom Stoppard play. Here, the Laurel-and-Hardy-esque pair appear in nearly one-third of the film’s 37 fixed-camera compositions, a series of chuckle-inducing tableaux that clock in at just under three minutes apiece on average.\nEach of these shots serves as a nearly self-contained comic vignette, like a cross between a “Where’s Waldo” cartoon and a Gregory Crewdson photograph, and the best way to approach them is as you might a large-canvas painting or a Jacques Tati film: Study the faces, soak up the details, allow the eye to wander and the mind to free-associate. Where other directors seek out exceptional moments, Andersson endeavors to capture the poetry of the mundane.\nWith the exception of one scene, in which twin girls blow bubbles from the balcony of a nondescript apartment building, and another that observes a plumpish new mom (Andersson loves his ladies with a little meat on their bones) cooing over her baby carriage, all the characters here are adults. Most of them have fewer days ahead of them than they do behind, but none seem to truly appreciate the gift of living. Andersson does, and he wants us to recognize it, too.\nRight up front, the helmer presents three “meetings with death”: a husband who suffers a heart attack while struggling to uncork a wine bottle; an old lady convinced she can take her handbag to heaven; and a cruise-ship passenger who collapses at the lunch counter, having just paid for his meal (sorry, no refunds). More playful than his fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, who famously challenged Death to a game of chess, Andersson recognizes that there’s no cheating mortality — though sometimes we can speed it along, like the suicidal CEO glimpsed later in the film. Best just to have a sense of humor about it.\nSome critics have mistaken Andersson’s movies as “depressing” (while others have incorrectly labeled him a “commercials director,” failing to understand that he accepted those commissions to finance his painstaking feature ventures). “Droll” would be a better word for the artist’s attitude toward the washed-out blue and beige world he presents. His characters wear white face makeup to enhance their pallor, sleepwalking zombielike through their lives. Even the young couple seen necking on the beach appear to be doing so in slow-motion.\nIn the interval since his last film, Andersson has embraced hi-def digital cameras, which benefit his aesthetic enormously. Now, the helmer can ensure that even the far-distant background of every scene appears in sharp focus. Though the colors are dreary and the characters numb, compositionally speaking, there’s not a single dull frame in the entire film. Andersson thinks like a painter, following Edward Hopper’s example of enhancing loneliness by depicting it within a greater context. He shoots rooms at an angle, using perspective to direct our eyes toward the activity in adjacent rooms or on the other side of windows, instead of observing everything directly on axis, the way his similarly detail-oriented American namesake, Wes Anderson, insists on doing.\nIn “Pigeon,” people go about their business in the dreary little boxes of their lives, but they don’t behave like marionettes on strings, but almost like actors on a stage, occasionally turning to address the audience. “Today I feel kind,” announces a cheesemonger, while his wife gestures to the audience to let us know she thinks he’s crazy.\nIt’s unclear whether the shift to digital has allowed Andersson to manipulate his footage the way directors such as David Fincher and Ruben Ostlund do, using their locked-down cameras to make invisible nips and tucks. Regardless of the method, the film is a master class in comic timing, employing pacing and repetition with the skill of a practiced concert pianist.\nEarly on, outside a dance studio where the flamenco teacher gets a little too hands-on with one of her pupils, a lady janitor says into her phone, “I’m happy to hear you’re doing fine.” (Mobile phones are a rare nod to modern life in a film that appears to be set in a timeless retro past — and where King Charles XII and his infantry are prone to drop in unannounced, like characters in a Monty Python sketch.) The cleaning woman’s line becomes a hollow platitude echoed by many of the characters by film’s end, and yet, there’s something to be said for merely surviving in such an absurd world as this.\nDown on their luck, Sam and Jonathan bill themselves as being in the “entertainment business,” selling plastic vampire teeth and a corny laughing device engineered to amuse. These two friends look like they haven’t smiled in a long, long time. Emerging as the most well-rounded character in the entire trilogy, Jonathan suffers from melancholy spells, culminating in a disturbing dream sequence, where colonial soldiers lead African slaves into a giant copper instrument that produces a beautiful sound as the people inside are being roasted alive. What a curious species are homo sapiens. Judging by the film, we wage war, torture animals and take advantage of one another, and yet, Andersson assures us, things could be worse. In the grand scheme of things, he’s happy to show we’re doing fine.\nProduction: (Sweden-Norway-France-Germany) A Roy Andersson Filmproduktion production, in co-production with 4 1/2 Fiksjon, Essentail Filmproduction, Parisienne de Production, Sveriges Television, Arte France Cinema, ZDF/Arte, with support from Svenska Filminstitutet, Eurimages Council of Europe, Nordisk Film- och TV Fond, Norska Filmfonden, Film- ind Medienstiftung NRW, CNC.

        "text": "Steven Spielberg has Ready Player One officially out in theaters today and Carl's Jr. tried to get in on the marketing fun by renaming their new charbroiled sliders to \"SpielBurgers.\" The legendary director caught wind of the fast food chain's publicity stunt and quickly shut it down after admitting that the sliders tasted \"pretty good.\" Though Carl's Jr. never officially renamed their product, they're pretty happy that they got some kind of reaction out of Steven Spielberg with a semi-endorsement.\nCarl's Jr. posted a bunch of spoof videos on Twitter advertising the name change of their sliders to the \"SpielBurgers\" to help promote Ready Player One and their new product. The videos each take on some of the director's most famous work, from E.T. to Jurassic Park. The fast food chain even decided to take their guerilla campaign to the next level when they had some of the \"SpielBurgers\" delivered to Amblin Entertainment yesterday, which prompted Steven Spielberg to record a response video and post it to Twitter.\nThe fast food chain tweeted over the weekend about the name change in honor of Ready Player One and noted that Steven Spielberg hadn't signed off, but that they \"assume that he's cool with it.\" In addition to the burgers, an employee even left a letter on an Amblin executive's car. After Carl's Jr. delivered the \"SpielBurgers\" to Amblin, the director announced a cease and desist to the fast food chain after sort of complimenting the taste of their creations. Spielberg had this to say.\n\"It has recently come to my attention that Carl's Jr. wants to rename their charbroiled sliders SpielBurgers and they're pretty good, but I'm passing. Cease and desist. You can't do it - sorry, guys.\"\nThe publicity stunt worked out perfectly for Carl's Jr. They knew that Steven Spielberg would never sign off on the deal, but if they got any response from him, it would be well worth it. Not only did Spielberg respond, he recorded a video that stated that \"SpielBurgers\" were pretty good, resulting in free promotion for the fast food chain and Ready Player One. Obviously, Carl's Jr. is pretty happy with the outcome that they orchestrated. Though the note on the executive's car was a tad bit creepy.\nAs for official partnerships, Ready Player One teamed up with the extremely popular HQ Trivia app for a record breaking prize of $250,000. The trivia game will take place tonight, March 28th at 6:30 PM Pacific and 9:30 PM Eastern, to celebrate the release of the movie. As for Steven Spielberg actually eating Carl's Jr., that has to be a bit of a white lie. One cannot imagine one of the most legendary directors of all time eating that type of fast food, even though our president mows down McDonald's more than once a week. You can check out the brilliant marketing plan to promote fast food and Ready Player One below, courtesy of the Carl's Jr. Twitter account."

        "text": "Hello fellow people who desire to change their habits.\nI want to start a habit of 30 minutes of yoga each morning before work. In order to do that, I would need to establish a morning routine AND wake up 30-40 minutes earlier than usual.\nI immediately became overwhelmed just thinking about this and already anticipating my failure. Considering I am not much of a morning person, and don’t work out EVER, this is a rather ambitious goal.\n*Deep Breath* Upon reading further I learned that many people have a burst of motivation when they start a new habit – however this quickly fades after a slight slip up or when you realize there may be limits to your motivation. This is why itis important that your habit be EASY PEASY and require little to no motivation!\n•\tDrink a full glass of water before my feet hit the floor (I leave it at my bedside all night, so I guess I ingest a little dust as well, maybe a gnat. Whatever).\n•\tGo to the bathroom (I told you, easy, no motivation, but super exciting to cross off your list).\n•\tClean out kitty kat’s litter box (something I would sometimes have no problem skipping before initiating this challenge).\n•\tEnjoy a cup of coffee (never actually skipped this before).\n•\tTake vitamins (when I don’t eat breakfast, I don’t bother taking vitamins because you’re supposed to take them with food. So this is another one that was easily skipped).\nYes, most of this stuff is stuff I would do anyway, but now I am doing it consciously, consistently, SKIPPING NOTHING, every day.\nI am only implementing this routine on BUSINESS DAYS. I have a feeling this is frowned up. But we’re just going to go with it for now. I am on (business day) 9.\nAnyway, only one day in the last nine did I forget my vitamins. My first instinct was to recoil in failure, but I went easy on myself and just made sure I got back on the track the next (business) day.\nAnother important part of this challenge is logging your progress and being held ACCOUNTABLE. This is where YOU - my fellow habit changers come in!\nSo even though I’m already a few days in – from here on I will check in each day to let everyone know I’ve accomplished my EASY PEASY morning routine and will offer support and encouragement to the rest of you."

        "text": "The Mapes family of Effingham enjoy the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago with their children including their adopted children, Regino and Regina, who were born in the Philippines.\nMisty Mapes and her husband, Patrick, of Effingham always had a desire to add to their family through adoption.\nThat dream became a reality in part due to Gift of Adoption Fund, a nonprofit organization that provides financial support to families that need help to pay for the hefty cost of adopting a child.\nThe Mapes, who have two biological children, Braydon, 16, and Madison, 11, were able to adopt 8-year-old twins, Regina and Regino — who go by Ina and Ino — about a year ago from the Philippines. They received a $4,000 grant that helped them pay travel expenses to the Philippines to bring the children home.\nThough they had always had tossed around the idea of adoption, they were spurred to take action when their older son asked them about it a few years ago.\n\"He said,'Hey. Can we adopt? I'd like to have a brother,\" Misty Mapes recalled.\nMisty Mapes, who works as a teacher, and Patrick, who is a dockworker, set about eliminating as many of their expenses as they could to save the $40,000 they would need to took to fund the adoption.\nThat final boost was provided by the Gift of Adoption Fund, which bridges the game when people are nearing the goal of completing the adoption, but need a little extra financial help to finalize it, said Marcy McKay, a La Grange resident and volunteer for the fund.\nThough they didn't need the financial help to adopt their children that the Gift of Adoption Fund provides, the McKays, who have three adopted children ages 14, 13, and 11, know how costly it is and are working to help other families adopt.\nIn November 2014, Bethany and Jared Crain got a call saying that they were matched with an expectant mother.\nWhile they were ecstatic that they could be adding to their family of three, they decided not to tell their 4-year-old that she could be getting a sibling.\n\"It's just so extremely expensive,\" said McKay. \"A lot of people don't have that kind of money.\"\nThe need on the part of children to have families is great, too. The fund estimates there are 140 million children around the world who are orphaned and 500,000 in the U.S. who are living in foster care and have no permanent family to call their own.\nThe goal of the fund is to inspire adoption by providing grants to qualified parents. Parents who seek grants are required to show that they have financial need and have already completed some of the steps needed to adopt such as working with a licensed agency and having a home study done.\nThe fund puts an emphasis on completing adoptions for children who may find it more difficult to be placed with a permanent family. Those children may be siblings, like Regina and Regino Mapes, children who are aging out, have medical needs or who may go into foster care.\nThe grants that are supplied by the nonprofit range from $3,500 to $7,500.\nJoan Schoon's desire to be a foster parent was born out of compassion and sympathy.\nAs a teenager, she remembers listening to her friends who were foster children complain about treatment they endured in some of their previous foster homes.\n\"They apply for the exact dollar amount they need and the grants are paid directly to the adoption agency,\" McKay said.\nThe fund was founded in 1996 by a couple who, like the McKays, felt thankful that they had the financial resources to pay for adopting children, and wanted to help other families who need the support, according to its website.\nShe said the group raises money through a variety of fundraisers such as cocktail parties and golf outings.\n\"It's such a compelling cause,\" said McKay, noting that many of their donations are in the $50 to $100 ranges.\n\"It's a perfect fit,\" she said."

        "text": "The Learning Network | What Have You Learned Playing Video Games?\nWhat Have You Learned Playing Video Games?\nWhat are your favorite video games? What do you think they have taught you?\nDo you think video games can help inspire social change? Have you ever played one that helped you understand a serious global problem?\nThis year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood’s residents.\nThe project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts — known as serious games — once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx.\nOne speaker at this year’s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He led the team of researchers responsible for the puzzle game Foldit, which sought to crowdsource a solution to a scientific problem. Foldit asked players to take on the role of a biochemist and map out how proteins might be folded in nature. The game provided scores based on how well they performed. Three papers in the journal Nature have been published, based on Foldit discoveries, since the game’s release in 2008; the most famous, in 2011, explained how Foldit players had helped to decipher the structure of an AIDS-related enzyme, a problem that scientists had been trying to solve for years.\nMr. Popovic plans to unveil a new project this week, a synthetic-biology game called NanoCrafter, whose goal is to discover molecular structures that could benefit vaccine and cancer research.\n— What are your favorite video games? What games did you play when you were younger? Looking back, what do you think they taught you — whether physical or mental skills or something more intangible? How have they enriched your life?\n— Have you ever played a video game like the ones at Games for Change, in which the goal is “more than entertainment”? What did you think of it? What did you learn?\n— Do you think video games can be effective tools for learning? Do you think playing them might actually help “change the world”? Why or why not?\n— If your school were to invest in a “video game for change” that was, like the examples in this article, fun to play, intellectually enriching and altruistically focused, what would you like it to be about? How might it work?\nHonestly I have never really played video games before, well I have but not as much as an average teen. But that little that I did play I just learned little strategies and the games really made you think. But they are really not that productive.\nI used to play games a lot but I have slowed down playing them now. I actually have learnt a lot of things from certain video games like strategies, and my friend said that he learnt that rubber comes from trees.\nI think integrating games into school could be a good idea. It would probably be executed poorly in most areas though. There’s a stigma against video games in general that label all games as bad for your brain and they make you do bad things.\nMy favorite video game has to be guitar hero. I think this game has taught me how to multitask with my hands. I think video games are very good and can help inspire social change, depending on the type of game. No, I have never played a video game that has helped inspire me to change a serious global problem.\nI don’t like to play video games. I rather do something else than be in four hours play games that not be educated.\nthe video games I have played are strategic and would make me think. I have never played a video game that benefits a cause before so I would go with some of the concepts listed in the article when deciding on one for my school to invest in.\nThat’s actually really interesting concept because most games are like what you guys said, fps and the like. there are a handful of games that are different or promote learning. I personally have not heard anything that could help with research.\nMy favorite video games are the grand theft auto video games. Not just because of the violence but also because I don’t play very many video games and it’s fun to just drive around and wander the game. When I was younger my favorite video game was a hand held analog stick with a few different games on it including PAC man. I don’t believe that playing these types of video games benefits you much. I’ve never played a more than entertainment goal game. But I think it’s a very intriguing idea, especially scenes so many kids learn from their surroundings and technology now days.\nMy favorite video games are Minecraft, COD, Counterstrike Source, Guitar Hero, Farcry, and Rainbow six. Looking back at these games I have learned a little more about weaponry, and playing video games has also helped with my hand-eye corrdination. I also think playing video games can help increase your reflexes and response time. When I started playing Minecraft I immediately fell In love because it allowed me to use my creativity and build things that I’ve always wanted to build. I think video games can be a very effective tool for learning because it makes learning fun. But I also think that it should be taken in moderation and staring a screen all day isn’t that great for you and neither is sitting all day. The more interactive learning is the better it will be in general. I think that bringing video games into schools could be a good way to bring more interaction to learning.\nMy number one game is World of tanks. when I was younger, I played minecraft. I was a 4 year minecraft player... Minecraft gave me inspiration. But when I got World of tanks, I quit minecraft. World of tanks has taught me alot. Ive learned alot since I started playing. No blood, no gore. Just fun with big metal machines.\nI don’t know because I don’t play video games.\nWell I have not learned a lot because I don’t play a lot. It shows that there is violence in the world. Also how to help you shoot more acculturate. I think that if schools had games then more people could enjoy and relax more.\nI have played some games that teaches you life lessons and some games that inspires you. Video games nowadays have little education to offer for you if you are playing modern consoles.\nThe way I learned to play video games is that most people can easily play any game if they put their mind into it. I play video games every single day and beat every single game there is its just what I like to do everyday when I get home from school etc. I can play really hard games that not everyone can beat i’m technically the best at playing horror games and war games plus games like assasins creed 1 to throughout all the other assasin creed games. I am such a video game expert i’ve played every system that ever came out from the beginning of atari to all of todays games. I just love to play video games.\nI love playing video games with my brothers. I play Black Ops, Mine Craft, Kinect Sports and more. Playing these games explain more than moving your thumbs it showed you how to multitask and some of the video games keeps you physically active when you have a X-Box 360.\nIm a senior in High School. Im always playing video games whenever im not either at school, work, or golf. I love video games and I feel that they are a quintessential part of learning. I have played almost every game. Games like pokemon help you to solve problems. Games like portal cause you to use physics and puzzles to play the game. Games like the bioshock series or the half life series create stories, that in my opinion, are better than reading book because you get to experience it. Even games like Call of duty increases reflexes.\n– My favourite video games are Deus Ex, The Witcher 2 and Half-Life 2.\nAs someone who lives in germany, where most students don’t speak english very good. I think video games taught me a lot about english. It was the only subject I NEVER had problems with. From the first day on I was too good for my grade.\n– I honestly have never played one of those games, but after this article I’m definitely looking forward to them.\n– I don’t know, maybe about subjects, that are boring and complicated for many students, like biology and chemistry? I personally wouldn’t be able to come up with an idea, but smart people, probably would.\nI play a lot of RPGs mostly. They are some of my favorite games. Most RPGs give you choices, and what choices you make affects the people, and world around you. Usually the choices range from good, to neutral, to evil. This is very similar to how life really is. The choices we make, whether they are good or bad, have a bigger impact on the world around us than we may think.\nmy favorite video games are games like Portal and Persona, games that actually require thinking while playing and not just mindless button mashing, the thing I think they’ve taught me… that no matter who you are you can always be a hero if you put your mind to it!\nUnfortunately not, I would love to have the chance to be able to though, I believe that video games are more than just a way to distract ourselves or have a good time, I believe that the educational value of video games are much greater than what people believe.\nYes, video games are tools, whether the tool is used for entertainment or for education, it’s full potential cannot be realized unless someone steps forward and says “lets try to use it like this!” and works hard on that.\nI would like that many possibilities for interactive learning would open up, these interactive lessons would not only increase the amount of fun in a classroom, but also the amount of passion from students who can honestly say that the lessons spoke to them.\n@Alondra The correct sentence would be: I don’t like to play video games. I Would rather do something else than playing four hours of video games that do not help with my education.\nI have played video games for years. All to often my choices were challenged or denied by my parents. At first I couldn’t comprehend the difference or what were the deciding factors for their answer. As I’ve grown older I see know how video games have the power to shape one’s personality. Even in video games there are choices to be made, altruistic choices that can benefit another individual in the game or choices to eliminate your opponent. The choices are made in real life all to often and it’s vital that children and teenagers recognized the value or consequences of the choices even within the games.\nI am impressed by the idea of Games for Change. If our school were to invest in such a game perhaps one that affords students the opportunity to understand how closely connected their games choices are to real life. A game that teaches altruistic behavior and choices while still having fun. We find a significant change and positive growth in our society through future generations.\nThe focus of the some games is to build what ever the mind can imagine. I think that games can be more than entertainment because it makes you think about things that you may have see in your life. It also could make you think of real building and structure around the world. Others games can make you think about real life world problems and make you aware that they are happening. They may also help influence what you do later in your life. Overall I think that some games can do more than just entertainment and can make you think about real things and ideas."

She can automate any process in a business,\" he added.\nAmelia can be pre-trained to handle requests and questions related to HR, finance, IT and procurement. In fact, according to Dube, Amelia can be trained to handle almost any knowledge-based task.\n\"She helps customers open new bank accounts, process insurance claims and register patients for hospital entry. As a whisper agent, Amelia provides her human colleagues with a personalised conversational user interface (UI),\" said Dube, who thinks Amelia can do wonders in transforming India's healthcare sector.\n\"Amelia allows patients to self-manage in scheduling doctors' appointments, tests and medicines. She can also offer condition-specific advice and well-curated health management tips.\n\"A robust digital colleague like Amelia can free caregivers from high-volume patient needs to provide specialised care for unique or pressing concerns, while subsequently providing patients with enhanced 24/7 access to medical services,\" Dube explained.\n\"AI and Amelia are vital for an inclusive and democratic healthcare sector and could have an enormous impact,\" he added.\nAccording to him, common AI assistants like Alexa, Cortana and Siri cannot read between the lines. They cannot understand underlying meanings or emotional expressions. Even when it comes to more advanced AI, the majority of these virtual assistants lack capabilities of contextualising information as people do, he said.\n\"When customers or employees interact with Amelia, they don't feel they are interacting with something artificial due to her advanced empathetic abilities, capacity to switch context and channels, and intelligent responses. Amelia is the only AI on the market that offers all of these features with expert-level accuracy and emotional intelligence,\" Dube noted.\nIPsoft, Dube said, is now exploring opportunities with a number of agencies in digital health programmes, to accelerate technology adoption which will take pressure off of the human workforce while maintaining and improving services.\nThe company, which has 16 offices in 13 countries, including one in Bengaluru, helps with the digitisation process required in an organisation to deploy Amelia and make her work.\n\"It is a crucial part of our work to make sure our clients have the right prerequisites to implement Amelia. In fact, we have developed Amelia'Marketplace', the first off-the-shelf AI-Marketplace for digital labour and conversational AI.\n\"The Amelia Solutions Marketplace offers complete out-of-the-box functional roles and associated skills for Amelia across verticals such as banking, insurance and healthcare,\" he said.\nIn order to train Amelia, IPsoft and its partners teach her the essential knowledge she will need to understand how a business runs.\n\"Partners provide IPsoft with industry-specific terminology, as well as any required logic frameworks that Amelia needs to learn to develop her decision-making skills,\" Dube explained.\nIndia, according to Dube, is on a \"straight path\" of becoming a technological force to be reckoned with in the coming years.\n\"An important part of this advancement is, of course, to invest in the right innovation and technologies that strengthen the country's already strong industries,\" he said."

They have said they're going to retire and some have just thrown up their arms and said'I could practice for a few more years, but you know what, the system is making it so hard I don't want to do that.'\"\nMarian Mancini, MLA for Dartmouth South, said one of her constituents, a young woman in her 30s who moved back to Nova Scotia from Alberta more than two years ago, still can't find a family doctor. Mancini says while the woman is able to go to the walk-in clinic, it's not acceptable.\n\"At the walk-in if she needs to get an x-ray, they'll give her the slip to get the x-ray and then do your follow-up with your family doctor. She doesn't have a family doctor,\" said Mancini.\n\"This is a young person.... wondering whether it's worthwhile staying in this province that she returned to. It's her home province. And she's thinking'I might as well go back out west because this is not quality of life.'\"\nLiberal backbencher Terry Farrell from Cumberland North said the McNeil government intends to keep its promise to improve the health care system.\n\"Nova Scotians chose that change resoundingly in October of 2013, they voted for that change and they chose that change, he said. \"I'm pleased to say that under the premier and the minister of health, we're in the process of effecting that change. That is happening every single day of our mandate.\""

When you see your son in this kind of pain, you also feel the pain with him,\" he told Al Jazeera.\nMohammad is among more than 500 child victims of the 51-day Israeli offensive, in which more than 2,000 Palestinians were killed.\nWhen Israel began bombarding Gaza, Saleh said he was afraid for his children because \"our house was not well-built and could not survive the bombs\".\nWith his wife Nisrin and five children, the family moved to a relative's home in Khan Younis.\nTheir home in al-Qarara was bombed by Israel a few days later.\nDuring a ceasefire, they returned to collect whatever belongings they could find. Saleh wanted to go alone, but his children and wife begged to join him.\nAn hour after they arrived, Saleh saw smoke. Israeli forces had fired a missile in front of his home.\n\"I saw all of them fall down to the ground,\" he said.\nThree of Saleh's young neighbours - aged eight, 15 and 19 - were on the street at the time. They were killed instantly.\nSaleh, Nisrin and four of their children were injured.\nThree-year-old Ayesh was paralysed on one side of his body. He has since healed.\nFive-year-old Remas sustained an injury to the skull.\nMohammad was hit in the abdomen and spine, and had to be resuscitated during surgery because of a lack of oxygen to the brain.\nAccompanied by his aunt, the child travelled to Turkey for further treatment.\nMohammad spent years rotating between hospitals and undergoing surgeries, but continued to deteriorate.\nHe became blind and lost the ability to speak or move.\nThe financial burden wreaked havoc.\n\"If I were to try and explain to you all the money I spent on Mohammad's treatment - his wheelchair, medicine, special food - I wouldn't be able to finish,\" said Saleh.\nNone of Gaza's political factions helped the family because they are not associated with a specific party, he claimed.\n\"We spent everything we had on Mohammad's treatment. We have nothing left,\" said Saleh, who was with his son when he died.\n\"Even though I knew how badly he was doing, and that he wouldn't last much longer, it was hard to accept his death. I loved him so much,\" Saleh told the B'Tselem rights group.\nAmit Gilutz, B'Tselem spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that \"one of the most horrifying hallmarks\" of Israel's assault on Gaza was its targeting of residential homes.\nThis policy resulted in more than 1,000 Palestinians, including hundreds of children, being killed.\nThey took \"no part in the fighting\", said Gilutz.\nThe trauma continues to haunt the Hadaf family.\n\"We don't even own a television in the house, because we cannot deal with seeing bad things anymore,\" said Saleh.\nJess Ghannam, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California - San Francisco, told Al Jazeera that he has documented \"many cases of severe PTSD\" in Gaza following Israeli bombardment in 2012, from 2008 to 2009 and most recently in 2014.\n\"Many Palestinians living in Gaza exposed to war develop symptoms of PTSD that include flashbacks, anxiety, and hypervigilance,\" he said. \"They live with daily distress and the expectation that something bad will happen, and this results in fatigue and general ill health.\"\nSaleh is among those who live in constant fear, saying: \"We feel like another war will break out at any moment.\"\nGhannam said this sentiment is common among traumatised Palestinians.\n\"Because of the occupation and siege, there are continuous reminders of war so that the healing process can never fully be realised,\" he said.\n\"Palestinians in Gaza live in constant fear of another attack and do not have any chance to process events and heal. It is a constant state of psychological distress and siege.\"\nChildren struggle the most, said Saleh.\n\"They become so scared when they hear the Israeli planes above us at night. Sometimes they wake up at night crying,\" he said.\n\"They are always afraid. My children are completely different than how they were before the war. Sometimes they have problems focusing. You have to ask them questions more than once in order to get an answer.\n\"All of these memories of the war and Mohammad's suffering will stay with them for the rest of their lives. They will never be the same.\""

        "text": "It’s immediately clear that Parquet Courts aren’t done now, not by a long chalk. Based in Brooklyn, Savage and his bandmates – guitarist and fellow songwriter Austin Brown, bassist Sean Yeaton and Savage’s younger brother Max on drums – have been releasing excellent punk-rock records defined by venom, groove and lyrics that make you wish you read more books since their 2011 debut ‘American Specialties’.\nIf 2012’s ‘Light Up Gold’ woke the world up to a group that many touted as the latest answer to The Strokes, ‘Wide Awake!’ is an indelible underlining of their status as one of the most important bands in the world right now. Before we continue, a mildly surprising fact: this record was produced by 19-time Grammy nominee Danger Mouse, whose CV includes The Black Keys, A$AP Rocky, Norah Jones. Far from softening Parquet Courts’ edges, he has enhanced everything that makes the quartet great – sound, imagination, style. The Beastie Boys, Black Flag and Talking Heads are all here in spirit.\n‘Violence’ is the first standout, a mazy, bassy call to arms. Like many of Parquet Courts’ best songs, it functions as an alarm clock, a cattle prod. “Violence is daily life,” they chant, Savage considering the “pornographic spectacle of black death” that is the human condition. But the frontman is there for the listener too, offering us his hand as he spits, “Savage is my name because Savage is how I feel… My name belongs to us all… My name is a threat”.\nThis band have long articulated the inertia of acclimatising to adult life, and ‘In And Out Of Patience’ – a classic Parquet number – does so almost flippantly. “I’m neither here nor there,” muses Savage. It’s there again on the breakneck ‘Extinction’, Savage poking fun at his daily existence (“I’m trying not to turn into a psychopath”) over impatient guitars.\nAustin Brown’s contributions (‘Mardi Gras Beads’’ dreamy textures, the spacey, desperate ‘Back To Earth’, maudlin jam ‘Death Will Bring Change’) take their time with their introspection, but cut just as hard. By the time the record spins through the pepped-up ‘Freebird II’, the irresistible carnival feel of the title-track and the piano-driven stomp of closer ‘Tenderness’, you’re left winded by its brilliance.\nParquet Courts are a magical band that make you feel everything all at once: youth, nostalgia, happiness, desolation, flying high, running low. The record’s last line, then, is fitting, Savage calling for “the fix of a little tenderness”. But where would the thrill be in that?"

        "text": "The controversial $3 billion corporate tax initiative Measure 97 went down in defeat, according to partial election returns Tuesday night.\nMeasure 97 was failing 58 percent to 42 percent as of 9:50 p.m.\nThe defeat follows a hard-fought campaign that broke Oregon's spending record for ballot initiatives and pitted business interests against the state's largest public employee unions.\nMeasure 97 would charge certain C corporations a 2.5 percent tax on their gross annual sales in Oregon above $25 million. The measure called for the state to spend the new revenue on education, health care and senior services.\nSupporters of Measure 97 were still figuring out how to respond Tuesday night. Ben Unger, executive director of the union-affiliated group Our Oregon which backed the measure, suggested a different tax proposal might have fared better with voters. \"Clearly, we learned the tonight that the details weren't right,\" Unger said. However, when a reporter asked if the tax rate proposed in Measure 97 was too high, Unger said \"I would be surprised if you talked to very many voters that found that that was the problem.\"\nPat McCormick, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat the tax, said Measure 97 \"fell of its own weight when people understood what it would do\" and now it's up to state officials to come up with proposals to balance the state budget. \"The business community does have members that are very much committed to finding routes to go forward,\" McCormick said.\nState economists in the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office estimated the tax would raise at least $6 billion for every two-year spending cycle, a 33 percent increase in tax revenue going to the state's current $18 billion general fund budget. That would have been the largest tax increase in Oregon's history, at least by dollar amount, according to Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner.\nThose potential tax hits -- and the promise of new revenue for government services -- spurred businesses and public employee unions to the highest level of campaign spending in Oregon history.\nAs of Friday, opponents reported raising $25.9 million, while supporters reported $16.4 million. The previous record for the costliest Oregon campaign was set in 2014, when opponents of a measure to label genetically modified foods spent nearly $21 million with supporters spending $8 million.\nMeasure 97 started out with 60 percent support in a poll taken a year ago. A poll in September found the same level of support. But by mid-October it had eroded down to 46 percent and by the end of the month only 40 percent of respondents to one poll said they'd vote for it.\nThe central debate throughout the campaign was whether corporations or consumers would end up paying the cost of the tax -- and how much.\nA study by economists in the Legislative Revenue Office found businesses would pass on part of the tax in the form of higher prices, and a typical Oregon family might wind up paying $600 a year. Grocery stores and other low-margin businesses said they would be forced to raise prices, because the 2.5 percent tax would obliterate their slim profit margins.\nSupporters of the measure said no economic modeling -- including in a study they funded, by Portland State University economists -- could accurately estimate the impact of the measure.\nThe backers argued it was too different from gross receipts taxes in other states. And they offered state-by-state shopping comparisons to show that different tax rates didn't result in different prices.\nBut Measure 97 opponents also pointed to a written opinion from a lawyer for the Legislature that said lawmakers could spend the revenue as they wanted simply by passing budget bills, despite language in the measure calling for the money to be spent on early childhood and K-12 education, health care and services for seniors.\nGov. Kate Brown, lawmakers, public employee unions and the business community now face the challenge of coming together after the bruising battle to address the state's ongoing challenges.\nVoters' rejection of Measure 97 means the governor and lawmakers must now pass a tax increase, budget cuts or some combination to fill a projected $1.35 billion budget shortfall in the next two-year budget. That estimate was based on the amount of money needed to preserve existing services and programs."

Sample addressed to \"Members of the Trojan Family,\" and in it he said he \"sharply\" disagreed \"with many of the conclusions reached by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.\"\nAmong those conclusions was that USC knew or should have known that star running back Reggie Bush and members of his family were receiving extra benefits from would-be marketers and prospective sports agents in violation of NCAA rules. As a result, the Trojans' football program was hit hard — too hard, the university feels — with penalties including 14 vacated victories, a two-year ban from participating in bowl games and a loss of 30 scholarships.\n\"…monitoring and regulating human behavior is complex at best,\" Sample's letter continued. \"…In this environment, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can…to protect our students, their families — and ultimately the university — from unscrupulous sports agents and others who seek to exploit our elite student-athletes or their families.\"\nUSC's stance is that violations with Bush took place — but they had no way of knowing about them. Bush has denied wrongdoing from the time allegations surfaced years ago.\nGlazier said such an appeal would be \"a pretty big uphill battle.\" He added: \"Just to be successful on appeal because you claim the penalties are too harsh, your chances are not very good.\"\nMichael Buckner, a Florida-based attorney and private investigator who has worked on NCAA cases, agreed that \"most of the penalties\" would be upheld. However, he said the loss of 10 scholarships a year \"might be excessive,\" noting that the NCAA usually reduces scholarships at the rate of two for every one ineligible player.\nBuckner, a USC alumnus, said it appeared to him the infractions committee \"did what they should have done and imposed the appropriate penalties\" considering USC's status as a repeat offender that was failing to properly monitor its athletes.\nBuckner's firm represented Alabama State — the only school to be successful with an appeal since the bylaw was changed.\nThat change was prompted, experts say, by a string of successful appeals that overturned certain aspects of sanctions against Oklahoma (2008), Ohio State (2007), Georgia (2005), Georgia Tech (2004) and Michigan (2003).\nNCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn said the bylaw change was \"part of the normal legislative process to constantly be evaluating what is happening in our structure and what's being addressed and what's being successful.\"\nAlabama State had its penalty of five years probation for widespread academic fraud shortened to three years in 2009 after Buckner's firm asked the appeals committee to consider how federal and state courts had defined \"abuse of discretion.\"\nNot based on a correct legal standard or was based on a misapprehension of the underlying legal principles.\nBased on a clearly erroneous factual finding.\nFailed to consider and weigh material factors.\nBased on a clear error of judgment, such that the imposition was arbitrary, capricious or irrational.\nBased in significant part on one or more irrelevant or improper factors.\nThat the NCAA would toughen rules on appeals came as no surprise to its membership.\n\"It's like anything,\" said Brian Battle, the compliance director at Florida State, which had an appeal denied in January. \"Any time somebody wins something, they'll say,'Where did we … do something that caused this separate group of people to overturn the decision?\"\nTimes staff writers Mike Hiserman and Eric Sondheimer contributed to this report."

Monday, Torrance Superior Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz said the girl had told her she wanted to discontinue them.\nThe Los Angeles dance community is watching the machinations closely. Misty won a prestigious Spotlight Award in ballet as the best young dancer in Los Angeles this year despite less than three years of dance experience. The victory caught the attention of professional dance companies, including the famed Joffrey Ballet.\nAfter meeting with attorneys in her chambers for nearly 45 minutes, the judge dismissed DelaCerna's motion for separate restraining orders against dance instructors Patrick and Cynthia Bradley as well as against the Los Angeles attorney who filed the emancipation case on Misty's behalf.\nDelaCerna had filed for the restraining orders because she said the Bradleys, who had taken Misty into their home for more than two years for dance training, had brainwashed her daughter into filing for her legal freedom. She alleged that they had only financial motives in mind.\nMonday's developments appeared to have had little effect on the tense custody standoff.\nSpeaking before more than a dozen news cameras and reporters outside the courthouse following the judge's ruling, DelaCerna's attorney, Gloria Allred, said she expected the Bradleys to honor a sworn promise made in court declarations that they only wanted what was best for Misty and would \"abide by any decision the family makes.\"\n\"After a great deal of thought, Misty's mother has determined that it will be in Misty's best interest not to have any further contact with Cynthia and Patrick Bradley,\" Allred said.\nEarlier, the Bradleys told reporters that they still had a personal management contract with Misty--an agreement signed by the dancer's mother--that gave them exclusive rights to manage her career, as well as a 20% cut of her earnings, minus expenses, until her 18th birthday.\n\"Our contract is still in full bloom,\" Cynthia Bradley said. \"We hope to continue to manage Misty's career and be her teachers. Eventually, we hope to see her on every stage around the world.\"\nWhen asked about the contract, Allred said, \"We believe that contract is voidable. We don't believe it's enforceable and we won't be honoring it.\"\nIn dismissing the motions, Smaltz said the case revolved around \"individual rights that emphasize personal success over the family unit or family togetherness.\"\nShe said it was Misty's desire to live with her mother and not pursue emancipation.\nSmaltz added that in a closed-door meeting last week, Misty told her she wanted the parties to sit down privately and resolve their differences over her career.\nBut DelaCerna said Monday that wouldn't be happening.\nReading from a statement, she said, \"I love my daughter immensely and will continue to support her in her dance career,\" adding that Misty will continue taking lessons at a Torrance dance school, away from the Bradleys.\nMisty also recited from a brief statement, saying, \"I am happy that this is over and I can continue with my dancing.\"\nBut in answer to reporters' questions, she seemed less sure of her words.\n\"I've always wanted everyone to get along,\" she said."

In 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal also ordered that the project be reconsidered because of inadequate consultations with affected First Nations.\nThe House of Commons was supposed to spend the day debating a Conservative opposition-day motion about threats to the Canadian economy.\nThe Liberals are under pressure from Western Canadian premiers and Conservative MPs to find a solution to the oil-price crisis, which the Alberta government estimates is costing the country $80 million a day.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Western Canadian Select was trading at US$27.95 a barrel, a US$11 increase from Dec. 3. In contrast, West Texas Intermediate Crude (WTI) was trading at US$53.13.\nThe price increase comes two days after Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced her government will cut oil production by 8.7 per cent starting Jan. 1. Notley has also said Alberta is willing to purchase enough train cars and locomotives to move up to 120,000 barrels of oil by rail a day.\nNotley has repeatedly asked the federal government for help, including a request that Ottawa amend or halt two pending pieces of energy-related legislation (one dealing with environmental assessments, the other a proposed tanker ban on the B.C. coast) that are currently under consideration in the Senate.\nBoth Prairie governments and industry have warned that the two pieces of legislation, which are backed by environmentalists and several Indigenous communities, could halt investment in the energy sector.\nIn an open letter to the prime minister sent Tuesday, Notley and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said the price discount must be put on the agenda of Friday’s meeting of first ministers in Montreal.\n“As proposed, the meeting agenda does not include any discussion on the crisis facing the energy industry and the price differential that is crippling the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Canadian economy,” the letter reads.\n“A crisis of this magnitude must be reflected in any discussion on ‘economic competitiveness,’ ” the letter continues.\nPremier @RachelNotley and I have formally asked PM @JustinTrudeau to include oil differential crisis on agenda at upcoming First Ministers mtg this week.\nWhen asked about the premiers’ letter, the Prime Minister’s Office replied in an email that the oil differential was “always going to be part of the discussion,” given the matter relates to topics already on the meeting’s agenda, such as competitiveness, jobs and trade diversification.\nIn an open letter published in the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald on Tuesday, Alberta MP and Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said “a perfect storm” is behind the current price differential.\n“I know how painful this differential is,” he wrote, but said his government is working with Alberta and Saskatchewan to find solutions to it.\nSohi repeated his instructions to the National Energy Board, asking it to produce a report on current pipeline use and efficiencies. The minister has said he wants to know if more capacity exists in the current pipeline system.\nEarlier this year, the Trudeau government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline from Texas-based Kinder Morgan. But construction has stalled after the Federal Court of Appeal said in August that the environmental assessment was flawed and more consultation was needed with Indigenous Canadians.\nIn 2016, the Trudeau government also approved Enbridge’s Line 3 project to replace the existing pipeline located between Hardisty, Alta., and Gretna, Man."

Francisco Ebreo as chief of the Bacolod City police in Negros Occidental for allegedly enabling the proliferation of illegal drugs in the city.\nFour other officers fired by the President over alleged link to illegal drugs are Senior Supt. Allan Rubi Macapagal, Supt. Richie Makilan Yatar, Supt. Nasruddin Daud Tayuan and Senior Insp. Victor Paulino.\n“They will be afforded due process. Hindi naman porke ni-relieve sila they are guilty already (Just because they were relieved they are guilty already),” Albayalde said in a press briefing.\nAccording to Albayalde, the police officers were only removed from their posts pending investigation and that the President’s move does not equate to their dismissal from service.\nHe also said the PNP has no right to question the decision of the President, whom he stressed is also the commander-in-chief of the PNP.\n“If that is the wisdom of the President, kailangan ma-implement natin iyon (If that is the wisdom of the President, we should implement it),” he said.\nAlbayalde said Ebreo was not included in the drugs watchlist of the PNP.\nChief Supt. John Bulalacao, director of the PNP in Western Visayas, earlier said he was surprised by the announcement of Duterte on firing Ebreo.\nBulalacao said that all the while, he was trusting Ebreo with the campaign against illegal drugs and that he was in fact “delivering substantial accomplishments” as chief of Bacolod City Police."

Based on the latest consensus estimates from FactSet, growth in earnings per share for the S&P 500 SPX, +4.96% is going to be 20.6% in 2018 with another 7.9% in 2019, along with 5.3% revenue growth.\nI do not believe this financial panic is only about the expected slowdown in the economy and earnings.\nIt is true that the stock market is forward-looking and that both EPS and GDP growth are expected to slow in 2019. A good example of what happens in a slowdown of EPS and GDP growth is the 2014-2016 stock-market environment, where we had several quarters with negative EPS growth (see chart). The stock market went into a trading range but retested the highs of that trading range multiple times before it “broke out”."

        "text": "In November, Dubai won its bid to host the World Expo 2020. The city beat competition from Ekaterinburg in Russia, Izmir in Turkey and Sao Paolo in Brazil. Although the decision wasn't widely reported around the world, here in Dubai, the city went crazy.\nThe announcement was made late evening our time, and within minutes, the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, was lit up by fireworks. Shortly after that, the ruler, Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al-Matktoum, announced that all schools were to be given the day off in celebration.\nThe last-minute decision created a flurry of activity, as schools desperately tried to contact parents letting them know; messages flew around on email and text from schools, but in reality, the children were way ahead of the adults, and already contacting their mates with the news over BBM, text, and Skype.\nSo what does this mean for Dubai and the UAE? Well, the emirate will spend $7bn on the direct infrastructure it needs for Expo 2020 and it is likely to create around 277,000 jobs between now and 2021, when the six-month exhibition finishes.\nIt means more people coming here to live and work, more visas being processed, more companies bidding for work or supplying services and as this business activity increases, quietly in the background, it means data. Lots of data. Data on spending, on new residents, on schemes to prepare for the Expo, on the utility needs this sudden growth creates and so on.\nFor the IT industry, the surge in the data that companies want to analyse means more demand for software, hardware and services.\nDubai and the wider UAE recovered pretty quickly from the economic downturn. It kept spending on big infrastructure schemes and benefited economically from some of the tragedy happening elsewhere in the Arab world, as people fled conflict to set up home here. So, in big data terms, technology companies were already highlighting the UAE as among the fastest growing in the region.\nExpats, for instance, have to send their children to private schools over here, as state schools are open only to locals. The emirate's Knowledge and Human Development Authority, which oversees education, says there are 153 private schools in Dubai, educating more than 225,000 students across 15 curricula (such as the English, American or Indian national curriculum).\nPrivate schools cater to almost 89 percent of Dubai's population and due to their reputation, around 43 percent of local students also attend private schools.\nSo, as the emirate's companies employ more people, you can guarantee that those who run the private schools are crunching the numbers as they try and estimate how many extra places will be needed over the next seven years, in which curricula they are likely to enrol and seeking trends in educational practices that can be adopted as they accommodate the rising student population. And so it will be for every other industry.\nAnalyst firm IDC recently predicted before the win that investment in business analytics in the Middle East is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20 percent over the next five years. Just over 40 percent of CIOs in the Middle East, it said, are considering investments in analytics and big data technologies.\nThe UAE, it added, \"has been at the forefront of business analytics and big data adoption across the Middle East\".\nThe company said 58 percent of CIOs cited governance, regulation and compliance requirements, transparency, and reporting as key reasons for investing in big data and analytics technologies.\nEMC research also points to growing awareness of data analytics in the UAE. Its survey among 237 IT decision makers in the country found that 87 percent of respondents thought decision making within their company could be improved through better use of data, with 67 percent saying that senior managers trust the insights such analysis provides when making important business decisions.\nFurther, 45 percent felt they had gained a competitive edge over a rival through big data analytics, with 67 percent stating that organisations that use such tools will be the ones that succeed. However, 27 percent of those surveyed said they have no plans to use big data technology and 57 percent said the lack of a clear business case or proven return on investment was the most common reason for not adopting it.\nSo, while a quarter of companies are yet to be convinced, big data has the attention of the region's IT heads. It is more a case of coming, rather than arrived, but is still good news for all those involved in the industry. Third-party data centres for instance, are still an emerging industry in the Middle East, albeit now in the latter stages (and in the UAE, established).\nUAE neighbour Saudi Arabia, for instance, is also investing heavily. It has some pretty strict rules about where data can be held and as the region's engine of growth, datacentres could become big business. IDC reports that by the end of this year, the kingdom's IT spending will have reached $1.09bn, up 15.1 percent on 2012. Much of that is going into datacentres and IT as a service business models.\nSo a growing economy is positive for future business, but it is likely to quickly uncover the fact that while data sets grow, the skills to analyse it, at least initially, won't keep pace. Big data analytics isn't all about the technology; it requires the human touch too. It is humans that set up the analysis and humans that through cognition, interpret the data.\nWhile the regional big data industry is firmly fledgling at the moment, it is expected to see high percentage growth in the next few years. And that also means a period of opportunity for the analysts, particularly those who can quickly adapt their skills.\nThere is, I think, a measure of overconfidence around big data in the region, highlighted to a degree by the EMC's survey, where 79 percent of UAE-based respondents said their company had the right skills and knowledge to complete business priorities successfully and an equal number said it would be a challenge for skills to keep pace with IT innovation over the next three years.\nBut expect Dubai and the wider UAE, and in its wake the richer industrialised countries, to be able to attract the people who can take big data and turn it into intelligence."

        "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Companies involved in U.S. construction plan on intensifying their involvement in green building over the next three years, according to the new World Green Building Trends Study from Dodge Data & Analytics, conducted with support from United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) and its UTC Climate, Controls & Security business. The U.S. is also one of the global leaders in the percentage of firms expecting to construct new green institutional projects and green retrofits of existing buildings.\nThe global study, which received additional support from Saint-Gobain, the U.S. Green Building Council and the Regenerative Network, positions the U.S. as a strong participant in the global green movement. Responses from more than 1,000 building professionals from 60 countries place the U.S. green industry in context. The study also provides specific comparisons with 12 other countries from which a sufficient response was gained to allow for statistical analysis: Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom.\nAccording to the report, U.S. construction should see an increase in the share of green work in the next few years, largely as a result of companies intensifying their involvement in the green building industry. An increasing percentage of respondents projected that more than 60 percent of their projects would be green projects - from 24 percent of respondents in 2015 to 39 percent in 2018. Respondents projecting that fewer than 15 percent of their projects would be certified green plummeted from 41 percent in 2015 to 27 percent by 2018.\nWhile this increased share of green building is impressive, it is significantly less than many developing countries included in the survey. For example, Brazil expects six-fold growth (from 6 percent to 36 percent) in the percentage of companies conducting a majority of their projects green; five-fold growth is expected in China (from 5 percent to 28 percent); and four-fold growth is expected in Saudi Arabia (from 8 percent to 32 percent).\n\"The strong U.S. industry for green building projects is clearly an opportunity for U.S. firms, but so is the rapid rise of green in many of the developing countries,\" said Stephen Jones, Senior Director of Industry Insights, Dodge Data & Analytics. \"Expertise from experienced green designers, builders and manufacturers from the U.S. is likely to be essential to support the aggressive green building expectations revealed by the study respondents.\"\nIn the U.S., the highest percentage of respondents report that they expect to work on new green institutional projects (such as schools, hospitals and public buildings), green retrofits of existing buildings and new green commercial construction (such as office and retail buildings) in the next three years. When compared with global averages, it becomes clear that the U.S. is a leader in new green institutional construction and green retrofits of existing buildings.\n43 percent of U.S. respondents plan to work on green retrofits of existing buildings, again well above the global average of 37 percent.\nThe U.S. is also distinguished from the global findings in terms of the importance it places on reducing energy consumption as an environmental reason for building green. Over three quarters (76 percent) of U.S. respondents consider this important, nearly double the percentage of the next most important environmental factor, which is reducing water consumption. While the other 12 countries in the study prioritize the reduction of energy consumption, only Germany, Poland and Singapore do so to the same extent.\n\"The survey shows that global green building activity continues to double every three years,\" said United Technologies Chief Sustainability Officer John Mandyck. \"More people recognize the economic and productivity value that green buildings bring to property owners and tenants, along with the energy and water benefits to the environment, which is driving the green building industry's growth. It's a win-win for people, planet and the economy.\"\nThe study demonstrates the benefits of building green, with median operating cost decreases for green buildings of 9 percent expected in just one year globally. Building owners also report seeing a median increase of 7 percent in the value of their green buildings compared to traditional buildings, an increase that is consistent between newly built green buildings and those that are renovated green. These business benefits are a critical driver for the growth of green building anticipated globally.\nThe U.S. is also notable for having the lowest percentage of respondents who report that their company uses metrics to track green building performance. Only 57 percent of U.S. respondents report using metrics, compared to a 75 percent average globally. This may be linked to the fact that the U.S. is also the country with the highest level of concern reported about higher perceived first costs for green building, notably more than the percentage who consider this an important challenge to green in other developed countries with active construction markets like Germany and the U.K.\nDodge Data & Analytics is the leading provider of data, analytics, news and intelligence serving the North American construction industry.

The duo didn't spare a single Supergiant bowler as they effortlessly struck boundaries and sixes.\nSupergiant finally manged to put some brakes on the Gujarat Lions' scoring rate when Shardul Thakur dismissed Dwayne Smith in the ninth over, caught at third man by Rahul Chahar.\nDwayne Smith scored his runs off 30 balls with the help of eight boundaries and one six.\nThe fall of Dwayne Smith's wicket resulted in another two overs later when a charging McCullum was stumped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni off leg-spinner Chahar's bowling.\nNew man in Dinesh Karthik too didn't last long as he chopped on Imran Tahir's googly on to his stumps in the next over.\nEarlier electing to bowl, Gujarat Lions got off to a prefect start as veteran Praveen Kumar (1/51) removed dangerous Ajinkya Rahane for a duck with the third ball of the innings.\nThe credit for the dismissal should go to Gujarat Lions skipper Raina who pulled off a one-handed blinder at the first slip from a good length delivery that came in after pitching and cramped the batsman for room only to induce an outside edge.\nThereafter, Supergiant skipper Smith and Tripathi took the attack to the opposition and stitched quick 63-run partnership off just 32 balls to take Gujarat Lions forward.\nTripathi smacked Praveen for two consecutive sixes and a four and then Smith hit the bowler two consecutive boundaries to pick up 25 runs from the fifth over.\nBut Tye put the brakes on the scoring with a slower delivery by removing the dangerous-looking Tripathi in his first over as the batsman went for another huge hit only to lift the ball as far as mid-off into the safe hands of Finch.\nSmith was the next to depart when he mistimed a Dwayne Smith delivery to Finch at long-on with the Supergiant scoreboard reading 89 for two in 9.2 overs.\nTye once again came tothe party when he went through the defence of Ben Stokes in the 13th over.

        "text": "There is now less than one week to go before the gun goes off to start the Berhamsted Half Marathon and Five Mile Fun Run.\nAt this point in the schedules, there’s not a lot that the runners can do to improve their performance other than taper their training, indulge in a bit of carbo loading and hydration, and get plenty of rest before the big day.\nBut there’s one group that will be gearing up to fever pitch this week, and that is, of course, the organisers: the Rotary Club of Berkhamsted Bulbourne.\nThey have been planning the race down to the minute details for the past eight months, and the days leading up to March 1 are a ‘make or break’ race against time to make sure everything goes off without a hitch.\nThis year’s event will be the 33rd running of the Berkhamsted Half Marathon. The first race, in 1982, was organised by Barry Devereux, a Rotary Club member and a keen runner.\nThe race grew gradually, reaching a total of 270 runners in 2000, and over the past 15 years it has grown more than five-fold, with some 1,500 runners taking part in 2014.\nThis year, with the five mile race doubling as both the Herts Vets County Championships and the Schools Challenge, the Rotary Club could find that every single one of the 1,750 medals are placed around a finisher’s neck.\nWork starts on the event eight months ahead of time, with the Rotary organisers meeting in July each year to begin planning.\nPeter Robertson, who has been involved with the race for 20 years and race director for the last 14 editions, reckons that more than 500 hours are devoted to the process.\nOn top of this, more than 180 volunteers give up their time on race day – ranging from Rotarians and their friends and family, the local Lions Club, friends of the Pepper Foundation and the Hospice of St Francis, and local ATC cadets and officers.\nAnd every year, the race gets better; chief marshal John Simpson points out that this year’s race will have a group warm-up at the start area before the half marathon kicks off.\nThere will also be two extra water stations, a slight improvement to the course which will take the runners down Castle Street, and the option to buy a souvenir race T-shirt for the first time. Brownlow Road will remain closed to traffic, as in the previous two years.\nJohn and Peter both commented on the invaluable contribution of the sponsors, which will total more than 50 this year – including major sponsors SA Law, VAH, On-Site Maintenance, Charmac Ltd and Specialist Building Contractors, Iceni Waters, Elf Ideas, Gil-lec Electrical, Knight Frank, FFEI Ltd and Berkhamsted Sports.\nThe sponsors are vitally important, according to John, as their donations keep administration costs down, thus allowing the Rotary Club to donate more money to charity.\nThe Berkhamsted races have now become a fixture on the race calendar, not just for their optimum scheduling some six weeks before the spring marathon season, but for the impeccable organisation, superb marshalling and the beauty of the wonderful - if hilly - countryside.\nThe event is known for varied weather, from snow to torrential rain to blazing sunshine – part and parcel of an early spring race – and there have also been some major hurdles in recent years.\nPeter remembers how in 2001, the race had to be cancelled due to the Foot and Mouth outbreak, while in 2003, only a few runners showed up after a heavy snowfall. In 2006, he found out that part of the route had been dug up, only one week before race day.\nYet for Peter, the event never fails to bring satisfaction. “It gives me great pleasure every year to help organise the race for the benefit of the local community and runners alike,” he said.\n“The buzz on the day to see all the smiling faces is just fantastic, let alone the end result, when we can help benefit local charities.\n“I have been out in all kinds of weather but in the end we all shine through with the common goal to serve the community.\n> Sussex Sport Photography (SSP) have once again been named official photographers of the Berkhamsted races.\nThis year, like last year, they will be back on site with two photographers, Seb and Sally, who will spend a total of close to 10 hours at the event covering all 1,800 runners from four different vantage points, operating four different cameras.\nIn 2014, SSP took more than 22,000 photos in Berkhamsted, which worked out to an average of over 12 per runner, and after editing, some 19,288 of these went online.\nCompany director Anthony Bliss added that, in addition to the hours that the photographers spend on the course, another 25 hours were spent back at head office cataloguing the race numbers against the photos so they can be found easily online.\nExplaining why the coverage is so thorough, he added; “We have set the business up to reward the photographers to capture the emotion of the moment – the photographers are on commission to do exactly that – it is a win-win for everyone involved, so I hope everyone has a really good run this year”."

        "text": "\"Transmission Intake Filtration System\" by Frank Hercinger, Beau Kidman et al.\nThis project accomplished the design and testing of an internal oil filter for a manual transmission of a heavy-duty truck. Research was conducted in an attempt to locate a pre-fabricated filter, but the filters researched did not meet the required properties. A filter was then designed to meet the specifications of the customer. The concept design consisted of a steel rectangular cage wrapped with a stainless steel woven wire mesh. The dimensions of the filter were optimized to fill the allotted cavity of the transmission case. The final dimensions of the prototype were 2\" x 2\" x 5\"(Height x Width x Length). A series of prototypes were constructed with different design options. Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system. A significant pressure change was measured but this did not affect the flow rate. Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals. Finally, it is recommended that further testing would be needed to ensure proper operation of the filter under all operating conditions.\nHercinger, Frank; Kidman, Beau; and Van Syckel, Seth, \"Transmission Intake Filtration System\" (2002).

All credit to the City Council, the staffs of these fine organizations and the citizens of Rancho Palos Verdes for bringing about this brilliant result. The preservation of open space adds tremendous value to our city, and greatly preserves and enhances the quality of life of its residents. Many years from today, when Southern California is even more built out and dense than it is today, future generations will marvel at, and give thanks for, the vision and wisdom of these fine people who have created this wonderful legacy for us and our children and grandchildren.\nI have two daughters attending college this year. My oldest is a junior at UCLA and a communications major. My youngest is a freshman at Cal State University, East Bay, where she is on the swim team.\nWe have seen over the years the impact on our children’s schools from budget cuts. This year I feel I am at the end of my rope. The first day of classes for my oldest daughter just didn’t happen. She and her professors took part in demonstrations instead of lectures. Many of the professors in the Communications Department are facing layoffs. This is already a highly impacted major. You need a very high GPA your freshman year just to get in. Now, with budget cuts, they are reducing the staff. That, to me, seemed incredible.\nLast week, however, the crisis really hit home. My youngest daughter has been sick with a cold. She was at swim practice and was having trouble breathing. She spoke to her coach and he advised her to leave practice and go directly to the student health office. She did just that only to find out that it was closed due to furloughs. How can that be? Furloughs shutting down the health care of your child?\nIs that what we want for our children in this state? How many million-dollar homes do we have here? People driving cars that are worth more than some people’s homes. Shame on every lawmaker in Sacramento! Shame on all of us for letting this happen. I read the other day that our state’s public college and university system has been considered a model for the rest of the country. I don’t know if that is true anymore.\nI would gladly pay more in fees to know that my children will get the education and care that they deserve but I understand that that is not an option for everyone. So I ask, and it has been asked before, why do we choose to balance the budget by hurting our kids? Governor, where do your kids go to school?\nThank you for your front-page story “Local district a model of health” (Wednesday).\nWriter Melissa Evans captured the benefits of the remarkable resource that Beach Cities Health District offers within the larger context of the current health care prevention and intervention debate.\nI have experienced firsthand the unique philosophy, commitment and expertise that BCHD offers by being both a consumer and a volunteer.\nBCHD has provided valuable risk-prevention and support services to two of my family members, one middle-age and the other a senior citizen.\nIn gratitude, I’ve been serving as a volunteer on a strategic planning committee, witnessing how BCHD plans for and responds to its constituents.\nMany of us who read the Daily Breeze are fortunate that we are able to access health services for our loved ones and ourselves when needed.\nHowever, as a social work professor, I know that when we live in proximity to others who are at risk, whether through communicable diseases or other problems, then none of us can really be well.\nThere’s a famous expression, “The safest ship in a storm is leadership.” Hopefully, the public can garner the will to demand our politicians ensure that more people benefit from the visionary leadership and service delivery Chief Executive Officer Susan Burden and her staff provide for us in Hermosa, Redondo and Manhattan Beach.\nIt has recently been reported that House Minority Leader Congressman John Boehner (R-Ohio) claims he has not met a single American outside of Congress or the administration that supports a public health option.\n1. The cost of health care is wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy. Given current trend in growth of health care costs, the ranks of the uninsured will continue to grow at an accelerated rate as health insurance becomes more expensive and by 2017 Medicare will not be able to meet its commitments.\n2. The U.S. spends significantly more on health care per capita than any other industrialized nation because every other industrialized nation has a public option that controls cost.\n3. The argument that a public option will put private health insurance companies out of business is absurd, as every other industrialized nation has thriving private health insurance companies despite the public option, including those countries with so-called “single-payer” plans such as England and Canada.\nBoehner’s comment says more about either his integrity or the circles in which he travels than the state of our nation. Perhaps his party should be wondering if he is the right man to lead even a minority party and his constituents if he is fit for office at all."

        "text": "A common misconception about my profession is that we spend a lot of our time devising fancy avoidance schemes usually involving exotic offshore destinations. I’m afraid that for firms like ours the reality is much more mundane – think Canvey Island rather than the Cayman Islands.\nThe majority of what we do is quite routine compliance work such as tax returns. But this is interspersed with some more interesting stuff, including planning, company reorganisation and acquisitions. I love this advisory work, not just because it’s the most profitable but also because it is intellectually challenging. Like most of us in tax, I’m a bit of a nerd.\nThere is a lot of nonsense talked about tax. Contrary to popular belief most rich people don’t avoid tax: they pay lots of it. It is very difficult for a UK resident and domiciled individual to legally avoid tax – most of the “tax gap” is caused by multinational companies, and to tackle that needs international cooperation.\nI’ve found most people take a realistic approach to paying tax – they may grumble about it but in the end they’ll pay it. There are a few people who try to avoid paying any tax if they can, almost as a matter of principle. But they make nightmare clients, and I won’t deal with them.\nObviously a hot topic is where legitimate tax planning ends and unacceptable avoidance starts. My own view is that once you start introducing artificial transactions with no commercial purpose then you’re in danger of crossing the line from planning to avoidance.\nI have never advocated “packaged” avoidance schemes to my clients, and in fact have actively discouraged people from using them. This is on practical as well as moral grounds – most just don’t work, as evidenced by HM Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC) current 80% success rate when challenging them at tribunals.\nNot many people appreciate that George Osborne probably did more to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion than any other chancellor. His accelerated payment notice regime has basically killed off promoted schemes. Anyone who uses one these days is either very brave or very stupid.\nThere has been a lot of fuss recently over the fact that HMRC’s high-net-worth unit has apparently prosecuted only one person in the past five years. This doesn’t surprise me at all. If HMRC’s aim is to recover as much tax as possible in the shortest time, it makes sense to pursue a civil settlement – they get the tax plus interest and penalties (up to 100%) for comparatively little effort on their part. If they prosecute it can take years, costing millions, and there is no guarantee of a conviction at the end of it. The burden of proof in a criminal case is high and it can be difficult to prove intent.\nI didn’t know what I wanted to do when I graduated at the end of the 70s and drifted into accountancy almost by accident. I qualified as a chartered accountant in the early 80s and spent the first few years in audit before moving to more general practice work. I found I was doing more and more tax work and enjoying it, so I took the exams and qualified as a chartered tax adviser.\nI’m a partner in a small suburban practice. There are 20 of us in total and it’s a really nice place to work. I think so anyway, and most of our staff seem to agree, as very few people leave. We pay well and offer flexible working, which is very popular as many of our employees have caring responsibilities.\nI do fairly normal office hours, although sometimes I’ll work late or over the weekend if there is a particularly tight deadline. My hourly rate is £200 to £300, depending upon the complexity of the work, and I earn a decent, six-figure income. That’s much less than partners in large firms earn, but I don’t think I could cope with the pressure they are under.\nMuch of my time is spent making sure that our clients don’t fall foul of what are sometimes very complex rules when carrying out normal commercial transactions. For instance, at the moment I’m working on a demerger, splitting a family business between two warring factions. There are reliefs available to enable this to happen without a huge tax bill but there are strict conditions too, and my job is to make sure they are all met.\nOur client base is varied: mainly family businesses and their owners, plus some reasonably wealthy individuals but also quite a few high-net-worth individuals – people with a total wealth of at least £10m and in most cases considerably more.\nSome people have very complex affairs, and to handle them properly you need to know a lot about them, including some very personal things. I think I know more about some of my clients’ personal affairs than their own partners do. Confidentiality is absolutely critical. They have to trust me, and that’s why a good rapport with the client is essential. I get on very well with most of them, and some have become personal friends. If you don’t get on, then the relationship doesn’t usually last very long.\nThe clients who really annoy me are those who take decisions, sometimes involving significant sums of money, based on what they read in the newspaper or what their pals at the golf club have told them, without taking heed of professional advice. Usually it’s because they don’t want to pay for an hour of my time. A frequent mistake is to give an asset away to save on inheritance tax without realising there’s a possible capital gains tax liability.\nOn the whole I like my job, but there are a number of frustrations. Dealing with HMRC can be a nightmare owing to cutbacks and constant reorganisations. A lot of their senior staff have left and been replaced with more junior people, sometimes barely above the level of call centre operatives. Then there’s keeping up to date with the torrent of new legislation appearing every year. Despite being a tax geek, I struggle. How the average unrepresented taxpayer is supposed to cope, I don’t know.\nAll in all, I’m pretty happy with my career choice. It’s given me a decent living doing something I like. I’m coming up to that age when thoughts turn to retirement but I’ve no plans to cut back in the near future. I imagine I’ll carry on doing something in this line, even if only for a couple of days a week, for as long as I’m able. One thing is sure: people will always need tax advice."

She ordered raw oysters, Singapore noodles and one of the head bartender’s house-made apple sodas.\nThen, she engaged her lunch companion: the iPhone that has commanded — or at least divided — Henderson’s attention on countless eating excursions.\nSwipe swipe, tap tap tap.\nDining out alone? There’s an app for that.\nThe lonely experience of passively reading while waiting for the bread basket has given way to e-mailing or playing Angry Birds before attacking a 28-ounce, dry-aged, butter-poached slab of prime porterhouse ($65 at Bourbon Steak).\nThe development churns some restaurateurs’ stomachs. At Rogue 24 — a theatrical, envelope-pushing Washington restaurant where the chefs work at the center of the 52-seat dining room — proprietor R.J. Cooper has even banned electronic devices. But some diners have gone, well, rogue.\n“There’s not a lot we can do,” Cooper said. “They’re paying our bills. Here’s the thing: People are so attached to their. . . smartphones and tablets that they’re going to use them regardless. We’re not cops about it. We can’t make them turn them off.\nEric Ziebold sees it all the time from his kitchen at City­Zen,his four-star restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Southwest: solo diners with smartphones, tablets, even laptops.\nSome put them down when the James Beard Award-winning chef sends pumpkin tournedos and duck bolognese to their tables. Others barely look up.\nTo MIT professor Sherry Turkle, who studies people’s relationships with technology, the proliferation of solo diners focusing on glowing digital companions is more sour than sweet. “Having a solitary meal in a restaurant is a basic spiritual practice,” she said. “It’s a classic way to experience moments of solitude and to refresh and restore and gather yourself.\nLet us pause here for a restorative palate cleanser: The devices aren’t actually everywhere.\nDrive out to Washington, Va., to the Inn at Little Washington, a high temple of American cuisine, and you’re not likely to see any diners — solo or otherwise — checking in on Foursquare.\nFor another, according to owner-chef Patrick O’Connell, his staff works hard to save guests from digital distractions.\n“We’re particularly adept at casting a spell and luring them into participating in something that is riveting,” he said, adding that he couldn’t recall an instance of a diner goofing off on a phone or tablet between courses.\nYet some top chefs and restaurateurs who are not exactly enamored by the trend do this very thing when they’re eating alone.\nHenderson shrugged as her bowl of curried Singapore noodles got cold.\nOf course, she’d already shared it with friends: Before taking a single bite, Henderson had snapped a photo of the dish with her iPhone and posted it online."

        "text": "In 1987, Blessed John Paul II wrote his encyclical letter entitled \"Mother of the Redeemer: On the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Life of the Pilgrim Church.\" It contains a wonderful summary of the teaching of the Church on the meaning, mystery and gift of Mary in the Plan of Salvation. It proceeds through the Scripture, the Sacred Tradition, the Church Councils, and the Magisterial teachings of the Church. The Holy father wrote: \"With good reason, then, at the end of this Millennium, we Christians who know that the providential plan of the Most Holy Trinity is the central reality of Revelation and of faith feel the need to emphasize the unique presence of the Mother of Christ in history, especially during these last years leading up to the year 2000.\n\"The Second Vatican Council prepares us for this by presenting in its teaching the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and of the Church. If it is true, as the Council itself proclaims, that'only in the mystery of the Incarnate Word does the mystery of man take on light,' then this principle must be applied in a very particular way to that exceptional \"daughter of the human race,\" that extraordinary \"woman\" who became the Mother of Christ. Only in the mystery of Christ is her mystery fully made clear. Thus has the Church sought to interpret it from the very beginning: the mystery of the Incarnation has enabled her to penetrate and to make ever clearer the mystery of the Mother of the Incarnate Word.\n\"The Council of Ephesus (431 AD) was of decisive importance in clarifying this, for during that Council, to the great joy of Christians, the truth of the divine motherhood of Mary was solemnly confirmed as a truth of the Church's faith.\nMary is the Mother of God (= TheotĂłkos), since by the power of the Holy Spirit she conceived in her virginal womb and brought into the world Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is of one being with the Father. \"The Son of God...born of the Virgin Mary...has truly been made one of us,\" has been made man.\n\"Thus, through the mystery of Christ, on the horizon of the Church's faith there shines in its fullness the mystery of his Mother. In turn, the dogma of the divine motherhood of Mary was for the Council of Ephesus and is for the Church like a seal upon the dogma of the Incarnation, in which the Word truly assumes human nature into the unity of his person, without cancelling out that nature.\"\nThe first four ecumenical Councils of the Church confirmed and defined Christian belief about the nature of God and the meaning of the Incarnation, saving life, death, ascension and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Council pronouncements concerning Mary were made in reference to defending the truths about Jesus Christ and God's plan of salvation for the entire human race. That plan included, and still includes, the Mother of God.\nThe Catechism, in keeping with the unbroken tradition of the Church, makes the inseparable connection or link between the humanity of Jesus and the humanity of his Mother, as did Blessed John Paul in his encyclical letter cited above. The first four Councils of the Church, which are almost universally accepted among the broader Christian community even beyond the full communion of the Catholic Church, did the same. St. Gregory the Great (540-604 AD) once affirmed \"I confess that I accept and reverence the four Councils as I do the four Gospels...for they are founded on universal consent.\"\nThe Councils affirmed the core of the Christian claim about who Jesus is and thus, who we can become in Him. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD contended with a priest of Alexandria named Arius who taught that the Word or Son of God (who \"became flesh and dwelt among us\" as Jesus - Jn 1:14) was not God. Misusing passages in John's Gospel (14:28) where Jesus proclaimed \"the Father is greater than I\" Arius denied that the Word of God, was eternal. The bishops at Nicaea considered all the texts of the Gospels (such as Jn 10:30: \"I and the Father are one\") under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and declared that Arius was in error. The Son or Word of God is God (see Jn 1:1) and always existed. This was memorialized in the Nicene Creed. They used a Greek word homoousios, which meant that the Word or Son is of the same \"being\" as God the Father. If the Father is God, so is the Son.\nThe struggle continued for fifty more years before the First Council of Constantinople (381 AD) reaffirmed the creed of Nicaea. This ecumenical council also felt it necessary to affirm the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the \"Lord and Giver of Life\" who with the Father and the Son \"is worshipped and glorified\" and that phrase was added to the Nicene Creed. In the fifth century there were two more councils that addressed questions about Jesus. In the early 5th century a prominent bishop, Nestorius, rejected the title \"theotokos\" or \"God-bearer\" as a proper term for Mary.\nChristians had always affirmed that the mother of Jesus could rightly be called the \"Mother of God\" or \"God-bearer\" because the Gospels teach that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary. Mary's consent, her \"Fiat\" to the message of the Angel Gabriel (see Lk 1:26-38) was an essential element of the faith of the early Church, a model for all Christians. She was viewed as the \"Second Eve\" whose \"Yes\" untied the knot caused by Eve's \"No\".\nA Bishop named Nestorius objected to the title of Theotokos, Mother of God or God Bearer for Mary. The Council of Ephesus met in 431AD and affirmed Mary was the \"Mother of God\" because she is the mother of God in his human nature which, because of the Incarnation, could not be separated from the divine nature. The Council also affirmed that Mary's exercise of her human freedom, her assent, was a significant part of the plan of salvation, giving to the Incarnate Word, Jesus, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, his true and full humanity. When God the Holy Spirit \"overshadowed\" Mary the child born to her was truly God, the Son or Word of God (Lk 1:30-35).\nAfter this Council, a monk, Eutyches claimed that before Jesus took flesh in Mary but that there were two \"natures\" - a divine and a human nature. After the union of the two natures in Mary's womb, only one nature was left in Jesus - the divine nature. Eutyches essentially proposed that the divine nature swallowed up the humanity of Jesus. So Jesus only took on human appearance. The Cappadocian father, Gregory of Nazianzus, once proclaimed \"whatever was not assumed was not healed\". In that we understand the danger of the denial of the sacred humanity of Jesus. Redemption would not be complete.\nThe Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD dealt with this threat to the meaning and implications of the Incarnation of the Word of God. The creed of the Council of Chalcedon declared that Jesus Christ is one person who exists \"in two natures\" - a divine nature and a human nature - which are neither confused (\"blended together\" into a third nature) nor divided or separated. Jesus is fully God and truly and fully human. Thus, the first four ecumenical Councils defined the meaning of the most foundational belief of the Christian faith and, as a result preserved the great promise of that faith for each one of us. In these Councils, as in the Second Vatican Council, what was said about Mary ensured the continued proclamation of the fullness of the truth about Jesus Christ."

        "text": "Learning How to Love My Kids, Again (or why I'm thankful for Veteran's day even though it means another day off of school) | Thin Places | A blog by Amy Julia Becker on Faith, Family, and Disability.\nOur day started at 5:50, with William by my bedside. \"Mommy, the only thing that will make me happy is if you give me a movie right now.\"\nI squeezed my eyes shut. \"William, is it six o'clock yet?\"\n\"No. It was taking too long.\"\nWilliam knows two things: he is supposed to stay in his bed until 6:00, and he only gets to watch something on weekend mornings.\n\"William, you can go back to your bed for ten minutes and then I will come up, or you can go start an art project by yourself.\"\n\"But Mommy! The only thing that will make me happy is a movie right now!\"\nI've been attending a parenting class based upon Positive Discipline. The premise is that discipline doesn't need to be punishment, and that acting positive doesn't mean giving permission to do everything. It involves lots of \"strategies\" and \"solutions\" to problems. The adult retains authority, but not because of an assertion of power and control but because of firm but loving guidance for the child. I completely agree with this approach from a theoretical and spiritual perspective. I understand God as a Father who gives us \"rules\" out of love and care for us, not out of a desire to dominate our lives, a Father who is \"for\" us and wants our best. I see myself as a parent who wants to provide a lot of structure for our children, which includes rules and expectations, coupled with a lot of love.\nSo Positive Discipline seems right up my alley. And in the classroom of adults-pretending-to-be-children, it works really well. This past Monday, we solved the problem of one kid terrorizing a cat and another (mine) drawing with milk all over the table.\nIt hasn't worked out quite as well in our home. Last week (on Monday, three hours after class, as it happens) William and I played a Busytown game. At the end of the game, I was feeling very proud of myself for sharing \"special time\" with my son and crawling around on the floor searching for ladders and clocks and all the other objects on the game's board.\nWilliam was not feeling that same pride. He started throwing the pieces all over the room. I put on my Positive Discipline hat and considered the logical consequences of his actions. I told him if he treated the game like garbage, I would put it in the garbage. I gave him the chance to go to his room to calm down, and then decide. Ten minutes later, he looked me straight in the eye (with his pacifier, giraffe, and blanket, just in case I'm tempted to forget that he's four when we fight with each other and he wins, which is what seems to happen most days), and said, \"Throw it away.\"\nI made a big fuss of putting the whole game in a garbage bag and taking it to the trash bins outside. I then realized that a) I had cleaned up the entire game while William lounged in his bed and b) I was about to throw away a perfectly good game. So it is currently stored in the trunk of our car, and I am still trying to figure out how I should have handled that one differently.\nBut back to this morning.\n\"William, you know that we've agreed that we don't watch movies in the morning.\"\nHe starts pounding the bed. Hard. Over and over and over. In the dark.\nLet's just say it did not end well, and I found myself longing for a different model of parenting, one in which the parents asserted control and the kids just listened and did what they were told and there was none of this unbelievably time-consuming, emotionally-draining, hard hard hard work of figuring out how to love the kid and listen to the kid and be firm and clear, and all before the sun comes up.\nAnd of course, it's Veteran's Day. So we have yet another week with a day (or two or three, as has happened a lot recently) off from school. (We haven't had a full week of school since the first week of October.) And this day has begun, in the dark, in tears.\nI was ready to write a post today about why schools should stay open for national holidays. Close the banks. Close the post office. But keep the schools open and teach the kids about what or whomever deserves commemoration rather than offering yet one more disruptive three-day weekend. I stand by my guns on this one (yet another issue that would garner all the Mom votes in the next election), but it turns out I'm grateful that today was a day with no place to go and time on our hands as a family.\nAnd it was kind of fun. For all of us. William and Penny took turns using the scissors and got excited when they found great pictures to accompany our different items and hanging up a gigantic piece of paper on the wall of the playroom is hugely exciting. Even though it only refers to the morning, they've spent the whole day referring back to our chart to try to figure out what is supposed to happen next.\nI don't know whether it will help tomorrow morning to refer to our schedule. Moreover, I don't know if it will help two weeks from now. But I know that I'm back to believing that it is worth it to figure out how to provide the boundaries my kids need in order to grow up, how to provide structure and freedom at the same time, how to create the order that allows creativity and flourishing. I'm back to believing it's worth it to learn how to love them well."

        "text": "John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense.\nBut a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of \"teaching\" a position. If \"teaching\" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists.\nBut if the teacher probes the source of an argument, has students ascertain if it is based on inductive logic or revelation and is supported by empirical data or intuition, then students are learning skills that will be far more useful throughout their lives than learning to find square roots.\nIf teaching a subject means subjecting all views to tests of critical skepticism, tests of logic and of empirical support, of credibility and of evidence, then I would applaud the attempt to subject all views to the critical analysis skills that we are trying to develop in our students.\nHow else are they to learn to distinguish between supportable generalizations and nonsense? And where better to learn such skills than in school, guided by teachers who can guide them through the processes of critical thinking?\nIn this approach, the teacher's role is that of a discussion leader and a participant, not a supplier of answers. Unfortunately, few teachers are trained in this area."

        "text": "Today’s residents of Chula Vista have much in common with citizens of a hundred years ago. Make that a thousand years or more. Southern California has always been an arid land, with cycles of drought, interspersed with wet years every now and again.\nIn December of 1915, San Diego’s city fathers tackled the issue from a completely different angle. They hired a rainmaker!\nThe impetus for their decision was the unfilled Morena Reservoir in the mountains sixty miles east of San Diego. A rock-filled dam had been completed in 1912, but the reservoir had yet to be filled beyond a third of its capacity. Other reservoirs in the area shared the same problem. None were filled and the city was growing.\nThe Council voted 4 to 1 in favor of Hatfield, though a formal agreement was never drawn up.\nOn January 1, 1916, Charles and his brother, Joel, set up a tower beside Morena Reservoir and began work which they labeled as “moisture enhancement.” Using secret formulas that Charles never disclosed, he mixed and released various chemicals into the air. Four days later, he reported rain at Morena.\nOn January 10th rain fell heavily for twenty-four hours, ceased for a couple of days, then fell in torrents from January 14th to 18th. The San Diego River overflowed, flooding Old Town and Mission Valley. Roads, railroads and bridges were swept away. From Balboa Park, water streamed down the hill into downtown streets. At one point, four feet of water rushed down Broadway.\nBy January 27th the deluge reached epic proportions. In the South Bay area, the water level in the Sweetwater reservoir rose until it overflowed the dam, tearing out a fifty-foot chunk on one end. The Bonita valley became a swirling mass of muddy water taking out farms, houses, roads, railroads and telegraph lines.\nThe Sweetwater Dam had been a tourist attraction. First built in 1888, it was raised and retrofitted a few times, until by 1915, it was the highest dam in the United States. A rail line brought sightseers to this concrete engineering wonder.\nA little farther South, the water level in Otay Reservoir crept closer and closer to the top of the dam. Construction on the Otay Reservoir dam had begun in 1888 spearheaded by Elisha S. Babcock who built the Hotel del Coronado. As early as 1897, James D. Schuyler, the engineer who had designed the Sweetwater Dam, warned that the rock-filled Lower Otay Dam might not survive a severe storm. His prophecy came true.\nNo one knows for sure how many lives were lost in the Flood of 1916. Some say twenty; others, sixty. Many of the victims were Japanese farmers who lived in the valleys. In the days following the disaster, several Japanese people could be seen in boats searching the South Bay for lost loved ones. A monument to the Japanese victims of the flood can be seen in Mount Hope Cemetery.\nThe entire San Diego area was isolated from the world, highways and railroads washed away, telephone lines destroyed. The only way in and out of Chula Vista was by boat from the yacht club dock at the end of F Street.\nOut near Otay Lakes is a road named after the dam’s first caretaker, Wueste Road; and in the campground at Morena Lake a plaque has been erected describing Mr. Hatfield’s rainmaking work in January 1916.\nCarrie, a school teacher, does her best to discourage Nate’s interest in her. Then the Otay Dam breaks and she learns that Nate is missing. She desperately wants him to know that she loves him, but it might be too late. Nate could be dead.\nPatricia Maxwell grew up in Oregon and attended Walla Walla College in Washington state, where she started writing poetry which was published in the school literary magazine. She met her husband, Burton, at college. After they married, he became a pastor which led them to pastorates all over the country. In 55 years of marriage, they have moved 25 times! In the mid- 1960’s, in a tiny town in northwest Pennsylvania, with two toddlers, Patricia took a correspondence course in non-fiction writing. Since then, she has authored four inspirational books and many articles, humor pieces, as well as technical articles about her husband’s world-class model railroad. When Rain Comes is her first novel.\nThis originally appeared at the San Diego Free Press."

        "text": "Less than a quarter of Elizabeth Wettlaufer’s lengthy record of incompetence was reported to the College of Nurses of Ontario when she was fired from a nursing home for putting the life of a resident at risk, a public inquiry has heard.\nThe college’s lawyer, Mark Sandler, noted that Wettlaufer’s employment record contained 44 instances when the registered nurse committed medication errors, or was disciplined or warned for incompetence. Yet only 10 were reported to the college, which regulates Ontario nurses, when Wettlaufer was fired in March 2014 from the Caressant Care home in Woodstock.\nBy then, Wettlaufer had already killed seven residents in her care and assaulted two others with overdoses of insulin. By the time she confessed, unprompted, to police in September 2016, Wettlaufer had killed eight people and assaulted or tried to kill six others. She continued to work, with an unblemished public record on the College of Nurses website, until she turned herself in.\nSandler suggested the college didn’t investigate Wettlaufer in 2014 because the termination report to the regulatory body didn’t provide a full picture of Wettlaufer’s history. “It could leave a misleading impression” if a nurse’s full disciplinary history and medication errors isn’t reported to the college, Sandler said.\nHelen Crombez, former director of nursing at Caressant, replied that administrators at the nursing home believed the 10 items noted in the termination report to the college would have been enough to spark an investigation on whether Wettlaufer was fit to continue practising. The termination report included three suspensions Wettlaufer received — for a total of 11 days — due to medication errors.\nWhen a college official called Crombez in July 2014 to ask about Wettlaufer’s termination, Crombez described Wettlaufer as “very pleasant with residents,” and added that her medication errors didn’t cause “sustained harm to the residents,” according to notes of the conversation presented as evidence. The only negative comments noted about Wettlaufer were that staff “always complained” about her, and she refused to change the way she did her job.\n“You certainly weren’t communicating to the college that she was unfit, incompetent, (or) incapable,” Sandler told Crombez, who was director of nursing at Caressant for more than 30 years.\nThe inquiry, headed by Commissioner Eileen Gillese, is examining how Wettlaufer could have left a trail of death and incompetence as a registered nurse for nine years without anyone stopping her before she finally turned herself in. Final recommendations are expected by July 2019.\nCrombez said she felt “blessed” when Wettlaufer applied for a job at Caressant in 2007.\nCrombez said she had no idea that Wettlaufer had been fired in 1995 while working at the Geraldton District Hospital, after she was found stumbling, slurring her speech and vomiting. She had taken large amounts of the anti-anxiety drug Ativan. Her union, the Ontario Nurses’ Association, grieved the firing and her employment record was amended to state that Wettlaufer had resigned of her own accord. The College of Nurses placed restrictions on her licence for a year."

        "text": "CNET's reporters are covering the launch of the much-hyped iPhone 4. Stay tuned for updates from New York City and San Francisco.\nIt's finally here. The much-anticipated iPhone 4 is hitting store shelves on Thursday at 7 a.m. local time in each time zone where it's available.\nCNET has teams of reporters covering the launch in New York City and San Francisco. Marguerite Reardon and Caroline McCarthy will be heading up coverage in New York, while Erica Ogg, Josh Lowensohn, and James Martin will be keeping tabs on what's happening out west.\nThese reporters will be checking in at Apple stores and other locations, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Radio Shack, where iPhone 4s will be sold starting on Thursday. CNET will also let you know how things are going at the AT&T stores where only customers who preordered phones will be able to pick them up. Anyone looking to buy an iPhone off-the-shelf from AT&T will have to wait until Tuesday.\nAT&T says that demand for the iPhone 4 is 10 times what it was for last year's iPhone 3GS. And Apple says it took 600,000 preorders for the new phone through its sales channels.\nIf history is any indication of what to expect, initial sales of the iPhone 4 are likely to be big. Apple sold more than 1 million iPhone 3GS smartphones the first three days it was on sale. The original iPhone sold about 270,000 units during its first weekend in June 2007, while the iPhone 3G sold around 1 million when it launched in July 2008.\nWhile there's little doubt that the lines will long, the big question is whether AT&T's activation system will be able to hold up under the pressure. If the preorder process is any indication of what to expect, iPhone fans may need to be patient. On June 15, thousands of customers trying to preorder the iPhone were met with error messages on AT&T's and Apple's Web sites. AT&T's servers were overwhelmed and the company ended up suspending preorders.\nTo keep up with the latest news from the launch, stay tuned to CNET's updates all day.\nMcCarthy, 6:24 a.m. EDT at the 14th Street Apple Store: About 150 people are in the preorder line for iPhone 4. The line for non-reserved phones is significantly longer. They're telling new arrivals to get in one big line, and then if people have proof of preorder, they sort them into the preorder line.\nReardon, 6:30 a.m. EDT at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store: The lines for the iPhone 4 are wrapped around the block at Apple's flagship store on Fifth Ave. The line for the customers who haven't reserved an iPhone wind down 58th Street and around the block to 59th Street next to the Apple Store. There's also a huge line of people already lined up in the reserved line. These are customers who have reserved their phones in advance and are just waiting to pick them up.\nWhile it's clear the crowds are bigger to get the phone, the hoopla and the party atmosphere from previous iPhone launches seems to be missing. With a half hour to go, no one is chanting yet.\nMcCarthy, 6:41 a.m. EDT: The line stretches all the way from the corner of 14th St. and 9th Ave. down to 10th Ave. (Google Maps should be able to tell you how long this is) and then up around 10th Ave. past the intersection of 15th St. almost to 16th St., but after the corner of 14th and 10th there are gaps in the line because of driveways, a gas station, etc.\nEmployees of the Apple Store are wearing blue iPad T shirts--no special shirts for this launch.\nMcCarthy, 6:44 a.m. EDT: First preorder: Been here since 10:15 p.m. EDT last night, originally had a 3G and lost it> He's a textbook editor for McGraw-Hill, and his name is Zach (26). He was about 42nd in line before they divided it into preorder and non-preorder. First people to show up who didn't preorder the phone got to the store at 3 p.m. EDT yesterday.\nZach says he took the day off work, and got his boss' approval. He is not playing hooky.\nReardon, 6:50 a.m. EDT: The doors open in 10 minutes. People in the back of the line only got here about 20 minutes ago. Jose Marinez, 36, said he has stood in line every year since 2007 to get an iPhone. He isn't worried that Apple will run out of phones, but he is a little worried that AT&T's servers might crash again. He tried to preorder the phone on June 15 and gave up when he couldn't get through on the Web site.\nMcCarthy, 6:58 a.m. EDT: Apple Store employees starting to cheer to rev people up.\nMcCarthy, 7:01 a.m. EDT: Preorders are being let in, 60 people at a time. It's going smoothly so far. Afew minutes later, the first batch of walk-ups (non-preorders) are let into store, but ushered downstairs rather than into the upstairs area. Only about 20 let in.\nMcCarthy, 7:10 a.m. EDT: It's been 10 minutes and the first guy in line has not yet come back out--AT&T activation. Apple Store employee talking to people who show up and wonder how long the wait will be: \"The demand is tremendous. It seems like everybody in New York wants this phone.\"\nMcCarthy, 7:11 a.m. EDT: First customer walks out with phone.\nMcCarthy, 7:17 a.m. EDT: This is going to be a long day for some of these people: there are still hundreds of people in the preorder line--still only one group of 60 has been let in--and the walk-up line is still much much longer. Line going SLOW.\nAn Apple Store employee tells me that they do not yet know when the store will be open to \"regular\" customers for non-iPhone purchases.\nMcCarthy, 7:25 a.m. EDT: Activation time in-store appears to be 10-15 minutes. But the line itself is very slow. A lot of people who may have expected to get to work on time might not.\nLots of reps from companies that resell used iPhones, or organizations that donate them to developing countries, are soliciting people in line.\nThe line for walk-ups is now all the way to corner of 16th St.--and keeps growing.\nReardon, 7:30 a.m. EDT: People have been filing into the Fifth Ave. store for about a half-hour now. The line for people who have reserved iPhones is moving quickly. But the line for people who have not preordered a phone keeps growing. It now ends near the corner of 59th St. and Fifth Ave.--people enter the Apple store on 58th and Fifth Ave.\nReardon, 7:40 a.m. EDT: I just overheard an Apple representative say that everyone standing in line right now without a reservation will likely get a phone. He thinks the line should take two hours to get through.\nMcCarthy, 7:51 a.m. EDT, en route in Manhattan: The RadioShack on 14th St. and 7th Ave. is opening at its usual 9 a.m. time, no one waiting in front, no ads for iPhone 4 in window (in fact, there's still a 3GS poster).\nMcCarthy, 8:18 a.m. EDT at RadioShack in Brooklyn Heights: Across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, about 15 people are clustered in front of the RadioShack on Montague St. It's opening at its regular hour of 9 a.m. The people waiting are a mix of preorders and walk-ups.\nThere are no Apple Stores in Brooklyn, FYI.\nMcCarthy, 8:32 a.m. EDT: A RadioShack employee just arrived at the Brooklyn Heights store. The line is not getting much longer. The first guy has been here since 5:30 a.m. EDT.\nThe 15th person in line is a girl who says her boyfriend is in line at the 14th St. Apple Store. He preordered a phone there and says even the preorder line is moving at a snail's pace; she, meanwhile, preordered at the Montague St. RadioShack: \"I'll probably be back in bed before he even gets to the front of the line.\"\nShe said the two of them waited in line for the original iPhone together but that she's \"over that.\"\nThat said, people at RadioShack know they're taking a gamble because they've heard the store may have as few as 10 phones in stock.\nReardon, 8:36 a.m. EDT: I just spent some time inside the Fifth Ave. Apple store with CNET TV's camera crew. Unlike with previous iPhone launches, the activation process is going pretty smoothly--customers are in and out within 25 minutes. No one I talked to reported any problems. Customers with preorders were allowed in the store first. And by 8:00 a.m. the store was letting in people without preorders. But the line outside for non-preorder customers doesn't look to have moved much yet.\nMcCarthy, 8:36 a.m. EDT: A RadioShack employee comes out of the store and says they don't have as many phones as they'd hoped. Even though the store technically isn't open yet, he's letting the people who preordered phones come in one by one.\nMcCarthy, 8:43 a.m. EDT: If people who preordered the phone aren't in line right now, it'll be first come, first serve. Only 4 each of the 16GB and 32GB models are in stock. Guy at RadioShack has a list and if people's names aren't near the top of it, they don't get a phone now. The line breaks up once people learn they won't get one.\nReardon, 8:52 a.m. EDT: It's a good thing that Apple is offering a tutorial at one of the tables for people to show them how to use the features on their new phones. Some customers were having trouble getting the FaceTime app to work. Two guys who had come to the store together to get their iPhones were eager to show off the new FaceTime video chat application. But at first, neither one was able to figure out how to launch the chat. Once they realized that they initiated the video call by clicking on the FaceTime button in their contacts, the application wasn't working for one of the guys. Even though FaceTime video calls are made only over a Wi-Fi connection, users still need to have a 3G connection to initiate the call.\nAnd unfortunately for these friends, one of their phones wasn't getting 3G cellular signal from AT&T in the Apple store.\nMcCarthy, 9:00 a.m. EDT: The people waiting in line at the Brooklyn Heights RadioShack had a definitive answer as to whether they'd be getting an iPhone today before the store had even opened for business. Most, unfortunately, walked away empty-handed.\nReardon, 9:06 a.m. EDT: The line at the Fifth Ave. Apple Store for customers who did not preorder an iPhone 4 is starting to go down. It is still wrapped around the block, but it's not to the corner anymore.\nReardon, 9:45 a.m. EDT at the Best Buy on 62nd Street and Broadway: 9:45 a.m. I was just informed by a sales manager that Best Buy stores in Manhattan and possibly throughout the country will only be selling preordered iPhone 4s. He said he doesn't expect Best Buy stores in New York City to have iPhone 4s in stock until next week at the earliest, or the first week of July.\nOgg, 6:49 a.m. PDT at the Stockton Street Apple Store in San Francisco: The reservations line is a third longer than the walk-in line, stretching around the corner two city blocks. While a few camped out overnight, the crowd mostly began forming around 4:30 a.m. PDT today. As usual, there are people passing out coffee and donuts to the eager iPhone buyers gathered here.\nOgg, 6:55 a.m. PDT: An update on the early entrepreneurs we wrote about on Tuesday: Chris Bank, the first man in line Tuesday, who was selling his spot for $200, actually handed it off for $400. The taker was Joe Sabia of San Francisco, who saw the story on CNET and decided to buy the spot and do it for \"just a really fun story.\" This will be his first iPhone.\nJoe Lobato, who was trying to trade his spot for a new iPhone, because he couldn't afford it, found a family of three to buy two phones--one for him, one for them. So at least a couple of the early entrepreneurs here were successful.\nReardon, 9:56 a.m. EDT: I just checked with my colleague Erica Ogg, who covers Apple. She said that some Best Buy stores are only selling preorder phones, while others will have phones in stock for people coming to buy them off the street. I guess the best bet is to call your local Best Buy store in advance to find out if they have them. According to the manager at a Best Buy store in Manhattan, all stores in the New York City district will only be selling preorders today.\nOgg, 6:58 a.m. PDT: The store is about to open, camera crews are crowding the entrance. No chanting by employees--yet. Then, as the Apple employees come down the stairs to form a receiving line inside the store, those waiting in line start to cheer.\nOgg, 7:02 a.m. PDT: The countdown from employees begins...and the doors open at two minutes after 7 a.m. The first people with reservations start pouring into the San Francisco store. So far everything seems fairly orderly. Only those who reserved have been let in so far. The people who made purchases appear to be waiting patiently.\nLowensohn, 7:07 a.m. PDT at the Apple Store in Palo Alto: The line here was considerably longer than that for the iPad. The guys at the front of the line had, like many others, spent the night in front of the store, though they only got there at 10:30 a.m. the day before.\nOgg, 7:11 a.m. PDT: In San Francisco, the first buyers emerge, all smiles, and of course, to the proverbial pop of flash bulbs.\nReardon, 10:14 a.m. EDT: Here is some more detail on the Best Buy inventory. According to an FAQ that Best Buy has put on its Web site, only stores that have more inventory than the preorders will be selling the iPhone on launch day (that is, today). Since preorders have been so high, Best Buy's Web site says it's unlikely that many stores will have enough inventory to sell iPhone 4s to walk-in customers.\nAnother tidbit to keep in mind is that just because you've preordered a phone with Best Buy doesn't guarantee that you will be able to pick up that phone today. Unlike Apple, which has said that it will have enough iPhone 4s available on launch day for everyone who preordered the devices, Best Buy says on its Web site that even preorders are first come, first served.\nFrom the FAQ: \"If I pre-ordered the iPhone 4 at Best Buy, will I get it on launch day, June 24th, 2010? -- This is not guaranteed and is completely dependent on how many the store receives from Apple. Any inventory received will be used to fulfill outstanding preorders in the order they were placed. For example, if the store has twenty preorders on launch day but only received fifteen phones from Apple, then the first fifteen preorders should receive their phone on launch day.\"\nBest Buy says that customers who preordered iPhone 4s, but did not get their phones on launch day, will get them when the next shipment of phones comes in from Apple.\nOgg, 7:17 a.m. PDT: After about 15 minutes, the first walk-in buyers are allowed to enter the store. Sabia, who paid $400 and slept one night on the sidewalk, gets a cheer from some of his fellow waiters-in-line.\nBank, who slept outside this store since Tuesday, gets a cheer from Apple employees, who he's clearly befriended, as he enters the store to make his purchase.\nOgg, 7:27 a.m. PDT: Just as at the iPad launch here a few months ago, Apple's chief designer, Jonathan Ive, emerges from the Stockton Street store quietly, nodding politely at the few fans who recognize him.\nOgg, 7:36 a.m. PDT: After a half-hour, only two walk-in customers have been let inside. Looks like it's going to take a lot of patience for people who did not have a reservation.\nOgg, 7:59 a.m. PDT: The first walk-in buyer here in San Francisco, Joe Sabia, emerges with his iPhone. He decided to not sign an AT&T contract, so he paid full price for the phone. \"That way if it goes to Verizon in the next few months, I can use it there.\"\nLowensohn, 8:04 a.m. PDT: Both lines here in Palo Alto continue to grow. The walk-in line has now stretched around the block. Likewise, the line for those who have preordered is around the same size as it was for iPad walk-ins back in April.\nCNET ran into brothers Christopher and James Nicholson, who camped out overnight here. Christopher explained that he had done the same when the Palo Alto store first opened, but that it was his brother's first time doing so. Another first for James was the latest iPhone--he had not owned any of the previous iterations. The two brought a cooler, as well as a pillows and blankets. \"I was kind of bummed [Robert] Scoble wasn't here,\" said Christopher. \"When I was here for the iPad launch, that guy was a lot of fun.\"\nLowensohn, 8:48 a.m. PDT: People with reservations who got here at 6:30 this morning are just now getting their handsets. On the walk-in line, it's still going to the folks who camped overnight.\nAlso overheard two employees saying the store was expecting a midmorning stock delivery. Though from the looks of what they have on the floor, there's a ton of stock.\nLowensohn, 9:01 a.m. PDT: Apple appears to be selling a ton of bumpers--a casing for the sides of the iPhone 4. Almost everyone I've seen walking out without a bag seems to have bought one. And most are black.\nReardon, 12:30 p.m. EDT at the Apple Store on Broadway and 67th Street: I'm now on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The store here is only serving preorder customers right now. Walk-ins who got I line early this morning are still being served. But Apple has since cut the line off. Patrick van Rosendaal, 34, who lives on the Upper East Side got in line here at 6:30 a.m. He was just going into the store around 12:15 p.m. He and everyone else in the walk-up line will have to get the 16GB black version of the iPhone 4. This store ran out of 32GB devices around 10 a.m., people standing in line said.\n\"Normally, I would have waited,\" Rosendaal said. He's had every version of the iPhone that has come out since 2007. Every year he has upgraded to the new version, but he's never waited in line at a store. After about six hours of waiting he said he doubts he'll ever do it again.\nReardon, 12:42 p.m. EDT: Apple sales representatives are telling people who are coming up to the line that they need a reservation at this point to get an iPhone 4. The line has gotten much shorter in the past half-hour. Customers who have preordered phones for this location have until 10 p.m. tonight to pick up their phones. If they don't show up, they will forfeit their reservation and the phone will be released for sale to walk-in customers starting tomorrow morning. Apple employees said they weren't sure if this location will get a new order of phones tomorrow. But they expect a line to form early in the morning to pick up any phones that weren't claimed today.\nMcCarthy, 1:45 p.m. EDT: A friend I bumped into when I showed up at the 14th St. Apple store in NYC at 6:15 a.m. is still in line.\nLowensohn, 10:56 a.m. PDT: The lines here in Palo Alto are still going, but the one for walk-ins is now considerably shorter than earlier in the day. The rain has given way to warm and sunny weather, which prompted iPhone advertising and analytics company Mobclix to park a large Ben & Jerry's ice cream truck next to the line. At this point it's safe to say anyone who's spent more than a few hours in line will have had enough sugar to put down an elephant.\nLinegoers did get another treat in the form of a FedEx and UPS truck both pulling up across the street from the store and unloading piles of brown boxes, though the Apple employees who were unloading them were quick to point out that they were not additional iPhone units. CNET later confirmed that many of the boxes contained iPad models with 3G antennas. But the truck's arrival does explain the earlier rumors of a delivery on its way.\nReardon, 2 p.m. EDT: At the AT&T store at 95th and Broadway. It looks like preordering the phone and picking it up from an AT&T store may have been the best bet for customers looking to get an iPhone 4 on launch day with no hassles or long lines. I just checked out an AT&T store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. There was no line in the store, and a sales representative said that no significant line had formed at any point of the day. Customers came into the store at their leisure to pick up their preordered phones today.\n\"There were a few people in line early at 7 a.m.,\" he said. \"But most people were able to just walk in and pick up their new phones.\" Even customers who hadn't expected to get their phone delivered today were able to get their iPhone, he added.\nAT&T informed customers earlier this week that the company would only sell preordered phones at its retail locations on launch day. It will begin selling the phones to people who were not able to preorder starting Tuesday, June 29. The sales representative said he expects the store to have plenty of phones in stock for the release on Tuesday, but he urges customers to get in line early. The store opens at 7 a.m.\nLowensohn, 11:40 a.m. PDT: Here at the Apple store in Palo Alto, people without reservations now have to wait 4 to 5 hours, while people with reservations have to wait approximately 3 hours. The line for people with reservations is also approximately five times the size of the walk-in line, but it's moving faster.\nFolks with reservations have until 9 p.m. to get in line and be guaranteed a phone today.\nLowensohn, 1:14 p.m. PDT: Just a quick update from the Palo Alto store, where the people currently at the front of the reservation line have now been waiting for 7 hours to get their phones."

        "text": "Does a Pyrethrin-Based Spray Kill Gnats?\nPyrethrins rapidly decompose after exposure to light and air.\nFungus gnats are tiny insects that can quickly become a huge nuisance in outdoor areas during stretches of cool, wet weather. Harmless to people, pets and landscaping plants, adult gnat populations quickly get out of control because each female can lay up to 300 eggs, with each egg hatching in about three days. Pyrethrin-based insecticidal sprays can help you control extreme gnat infestations, but you must start treatment as soon as you notice the pests.\nPyrethrins are natural, botanical pesticides derived from the flowers of certain chrysanthemums. The blooms are harvested and typically dried or ground into powder. Adult fungus gnats are highly susceptible to pyrethrins, which work as a contact poison that rapidly penetrates the insect's nervous system so it can't fly or move around. Although gnats drop almost immediately after you spray them, they don't always die. Gnats, like other insects, possess an enzyme that quickly detoxifies the pyrethrins, which allows some gnats to recover after initially being knocked down. Because of this, many pyrethrin-based products also contain a petroleum-derived synergist or carbamate to slow down that enzyme's action. Many pyrethrin products come in ready-to-spray formulations that make outdoor treatment easy.\nPyrethrin-based sprays quickly reduce fungus gnat populations, but control is typically temporary. New adult gnats emerge every day, so be prepared to spray affected plants about every three days for at least 14 days to get rid of the pests. After reading the instructions on the product's label, attach a container of ready-to-spray, pyrethrin-based insecticide to a garden hose. Once you turn on the water, it automatically mixes with the chemicals to form the correct application dosage. Hold the container 18 to 24 inches away from the target plant and thoroughly spray the tops and undersides of the leaves. Spray the surface of the soil around gnat-infested plants as well. Allow the solution to completely dry before reentering the treated area. For optimal control results, use a pyrethrin spray only when rain isn't predicted for your area for at least 24 hours.\nPyrethrin can cause itching, irritation or a burning sensation if it makes contact with skin, so reduce your risk of exposure by wearing protective clothing, including long sleeves, pants, socks and shoes, a face mask, goggles and rubber or latex gloves. Start spraying for gnats at the farthest corner of your target treatment area and work your way backward to avoid walking through sprayed areas. Spray pyrethrin products when the air is calm to avoid drift. Pyrethrin is highly toxic to honey bees, so spray plants just before sunup or at twilight to avoid harming the pollinating insects.\nMature fungus gnats range in size from 1/15 to 1/2 inch long and have clear to pale gray wings. Although nuisances, they consume only liquids such as flower nectar and water. Fungus gnats are pretty weak fliers that prefer sticking close to their host plants. The legless larvae have clear to white bodies and black heads. They prefer feeding on fungi, algae and other decaying organic matter, which means they often infest soils, compost piles, mulch and yard litter. They occasionally feed on small feeder roots and root hairs as well, but don't usually cause severe enough damage in an outdoor setting to warrant treatment.\nKelsey, Amber. \"Does a Pyrethrin-Based Spray Kill Gnats?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/pyrethrinbased-spray-kill-gnats-92121.html.

        "text": "The messaging upstart's track record shows why its Spectacles video-recording sunglasses shouldn't be taken lightly, even if big questions remain.\nSnapchat -- or Snap Inc., as it now calls itself -- has become a $20 billion company in the face of constant doubting from consumers and pundits who looked at its messaging app, shook their heads and said something to the effect of \"I don't get it\" or \"This is a gimmick.\"\nThat's worth keeping in mind when reacting to its Spectacles video-recording sunglasses.\nSpectacles, unveiled on Friday evening in a Wall Street Journal column, costs $130, comes in three colors and lets users record up to 10 seconds of video by tapping a button on the glasses. The video is recorded in circular, rather than rectangular, form and is taken by a lens with a relatively wide 115-degree field-of-view.\nAs one would expect, Spectacles uses wireless links to pair with smartphones. Snap founder and CEO Evan Spiegel is trying to downplay near-term expectations for the glasses, referring to them as a toy and promising to take a slow approach to commercializing them. \"It's about us figuring out if it fits into people's lives and seeing how they like it,\" he says.\nStill, it's worth remembering the Snapchat app itself was dismissed as a gimmick -- nothing more than a way for teenagers to share pictures they didn't want their parents to see, and which wouldn't be permanently stored -- not too long ago. The same has held for subsequent features such as the ability to draw and write text on top of shared pictures, the ability to create \"Stories\" whose content vanishes after 24 hours and the ability to add face-altering \"lenses\" to photos and videos.\nIn spite of the frequent derision, Snapchat has grown to have more than 150 million users (more than Twitter (TWTR - Get Report)), a large portion of whom are in their 20s and 30s rather than just teens. It's also now avidly used as a promotional platform by many celebrities and media firms, and its parent is reportedly aiming for at least $300 million in 2016 revenue.\nBy creating a platform where shared content by and large isn't saved, and where users don't have to worry about likes and comments, Snap has carved out a unique social media and messaging niche and become a thorn in Facebook's (FB - Get Report) side, particularly among younger consumers.\nIf it's able to reach lower price points, win over third-party hardware makers and sidestep the privacy and image concerns that have plagued Alphabet's (GOOGL - Get Report) Google Glass, Spectacles could provide another means of expanding Snap's reach.\nFacebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB or GOOGL? Learn more now.\nLimited as they are right now, Spectacles fulfill one of the goals Google Glass has long had: To let users do things they typically rely on a smartphone for while keeping both of their hands free. As the WSJ writers, \"as you record, your hands are free to pet dogs, hug babies or flail around at a concert. You can reach your arms out to people you're filming, instead of holding your phone up, as Spiegel describes it,'like a wall in front of your face.'\"\nMoreover, Snap is going to great lengths to avoid having Spectacles viewed as a product for geeks, the way Glass has been -- just see this YouTube video for the glasses if you need proof.\nAt the same time, just as Glass has sought to do much more than record photos and video, Spiegel hints Spectacles could have a larger set of use cases (accessing information? conducting e-commerce transactions?) if they become widely adopted as an image-recording tool.\nUnlike Google with Glass, Snap is taking a bottoms-up approach to the wearables market, creating a cheap, simple device that can take over a core smartphone feature and potentially expanding its feature set in time.\nThe company's decision to simultaneously rename itself Snap is also telling. In addition to providing a more serious-sounding corporate moniker ahead of an expected IPO, the former Snapchat's new name points to a future where the company sees itself less as a provider of ephemeral messaging apps than as a provider of solutions for sharing what people see in the world around them via camera lenses.\nFacebook, which depends so heavily on the photo and video sharing of its users to drive engagement, and whose attempts to create rivals to Snapchat have failed to date, has to be watching carefully. This is particularly true given how the sharing of personally-created content on Facebook news feeds has been pressured by the growing popularity of messaging apps in general.\nFor now, Spectacles is still far more an unfinished experiment by a quirky upstart than a threat to Facebook or anyone else. But that upstart's history of fending off much bigger rivals and striking gold where few expected means it's worth taking seriously."

John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2019 in Washington.\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s attorney general nominee will have to navigate his confirmation hearing skillfully, emphasizing his support for President Donald Trump’s policies while assuring Democrats he will act independently and won’t interfere with the special counsel’s Russia investigation.\nWilliam Barr will face questions Tuesday from the Senate Judiciary Committee about his relationship with Trump and his views on executive powers.\nBarr plans to tell legislators that Trump never sought any promises, assurances or commitments — and that he didn’t offer Trump any — before he was nominated for the post.\nTrump has repeatedly complained that his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was insufficiently loyal because he recused himself from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. Trump ultimately forced Sessions from office.\nBarr, 68, is expected to be confirmed, unless there is a major surprise during the hearing. It would be his second stint as attorney general, a position he held from 1991 to 1993 during the George H.W. Bush administration.\nThe hearing will be the first time a high-profile nominee will come before the committee since it considered the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct. The panel has a new chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\nOn Monday, the Justice Department moved to pre-empt the most significant questions that Barr is likely to face by releasing his prepared remarks. Barr plans to tell the senators that it is “vitally important” that Mueller be allowed to complete his investigation and that he believes Congress and the public should learn the results.\n“I believe it is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Barr says.\nBarr describes Mueller, a former Justice Department colleague, as a friend he has known personally and professionally for 30 years. Mueller headed the department’s criminal division when Barr served as attorney general.\nThe special counsel is required to confidentially report his findings to the Justice Department. In his prepared remarks, Barr stops short of directly pledging to release Mueller’s report, but he expresses general support for disclosing the findings, whatever they may be.\nDemocrats had raised concerns about Barr’s prior comments about the Russia investigation, including an unsolicited memo he sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last year criticizing the inquiry into whether the president had obstructed justice.\nBarr also sent the memo to White House lawyers and discussed it with Trump’s personal attorneys and a lawyer who represents Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, he said in a letter to Graham. Copies also were sent by Barr to White House lawyer Emmet Flood, Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Pat Cipollone, who is now White House counsel. Barr said he discussed the contents of the memo with Trump’s attorneys, Jay Sekulow and Jane and Martin Raskin.\nThe development is likely to raise even more questions at the hearing about Barr’s contact with those close to Trump ahead of his nomination. He has insisted that the memo was not to influence public opinion about Mueller’s investigation.\nBarr’s role leading the Russia investigation may be especially important since Rosenstein, who has overseen the day-to-day work of Mueller’s team, expects to leave the Justice Department soon after Barr is confirmed. It is not clear how much of the investigation will be left by then.\nBarr would replace acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who declined to recuse himself from the investigation — despite the advice of a Justice Department ethics official and calls from Democrats who cited Whitaker’s past critical comments on the probe."

Dean Bisterfeldt, a 6-foot, 210 pound junior, is the newcomer.\nThey’re the centerpiece that holds the offense together, but they’re also the group that gets little notice.\nThey’re not pretty or flashy like their more skilled teammates, but they get the job done.\n“Truly they are the foundation,” Maddox said. “Without a great offensive line you don’t have the stats for Nick Bueno and De’Shawn Ramirez.\nSenior Grant Haggard (6-2, 225) and sophomore Ellis McCarthy (6-5, 246) are tight ends who are an extended part of the lineman family and help Bueno buy time with their intimidating frames.\nSenior Mark Rangel also is part of the family. He’s had valuable playing time since Lowden separated his shoulder against Blair in Week 10. His seamless transition has helped immensely.\n“Mark has been, in coaching terms, our No. 6,” Maddox said. “He can fill in anywhere – at guard, tackle or center. It’s not the first time he’s filled in for us. On occasion we’ll get Josh out on games where we can give him a rest and Mark steps in without a problem.\nLowden, a linebacker, and McCarthy, a defensive end, can grab the spotlight at times because of their tremendous athletic ability and strength, whether it be through an interception or a sack. But the others do their job, jog back to the sideline and may get nothing more than a pat on the back with the crowd cheering as Bueno or Johnson celebrate yet another touchdown.\n“They’re used to not getting their names in the paper,” Maddox said. “That kind of goes along with the job and they’re kind of proud of it. It’s kind of like an offensive lineman creed.\nBueno, a junior, has rushed for 1,258 yards and 14 touchdowns and passed for 923 yards and 10 touchdowns.\nRamirez, a sophomore, is the second-leading rusher with 852 yards and 10 touchdowns. Johnson, a junior, is the third-leading rusher with 581 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n“The offensive line’s glory is when they open huge holes,” Maddox said, “and they know they’re doing their jobs and dominating the defense, marching down the field."

        "text": "In the real world, as opposed to the imaginary universe that neoconservatives and Wilsonians dream about, there are very few really good protagonists or really bad antagonists.\nA former Turkish diplomat told me that during a visit to the Pentagon after 9/11, a top official explained that the Bush Administration hoped Ankara would take steps towards strengthening political and military ties with New Delhi, as part of a process that could lead eventually to the establishment of an alliance between the three pro-Western democracies of India, Turkey and Israel.\nThe Turkish official was dumbfounded. Where was his counterpart getting his political intelligence from? After all, it wasn’t a secret that when it came to the conflict between India and Pakistan, Turkey tended to identify and cooperate with the South Asian Muslim country.\nNo to mention the fact that notwithstanding the partnership between Ankara and Jerusalem, the Turks never considered Israel to be an “ally,” as they attempted balancing their relationship with the Jewish State and the Arab countries. In fact, Israel and Turkey didn’t establish full diplomatic until 1992 following the Oslo Process that led to the rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nAnd in any case, the idea of Turkey siding with India and challenging the balance of power in South Asia didn’t make a lot of sense, particularly at a moment when the United States as part of its campaign against terrorism was strengthening its ties with Islamabad and elevating them to the status of a strategic alliance.\nBut then it seemed that Pentagon official was engaged in one of the intellectual exercises favored by both neoconservatives on the political right and liberal internationalists on the political left: Drawing up foreign policy narratives that reflect the dualistic cosmology of Manichaeism in which international relations is seen as a never-ending struggle between light and darkness, between the forces of good led by the United States that are confronting the bad guys, ranging from “rogue states” to “authoritarian regimes” that threaten to destroy the liberal international order.\nBut in the real world, as opposed to the imaginary universe that neoconservatives and Wilsonians dream about, there are very few really good protagonists or really bad antagonists.\nSo you need to make sure that while constructing a narrative one takes into account the “anomalies” and resolve the cognitive dissonance between the plot of the fairy tale and the many shades of gray that typify the relations between nations.\nHence, when the Bush Administration responded to the attacks on New York and Washington by Al Qaeda, the radical Muslim fundamentalist group, by launching the war against terrorism it identified Iraq and Iran as two of the leading members of the Axis of Evil it was planning to confront.\nBut that proposed narrative was full with inconsistencies. The secular Ba’ath regime in Baghdad and the Shiite clerics in Tehran regarded Osama Bin Ladin’s terrorist group as well as its ally, the Taliban, the Sunni Muslim fundamentalist movement ruling Afghanistan as ideological adversaries (in the case of the secular and semi-fascist Saddam Hussein) or as sectarian foes (in the case of Iran’s Ayatollahs).\nOn the other hand, two of Washington’s allies in the war on terrorism, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, were the two main allies of the Taliban while Al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden were proponents of the extremist Wahhabi Muslim dogma promoted by the Saudis and embraced by the Pakistanis.\nThe neocons that championed the Bush Administration’s move to oust Saddam Hussein and invade Iraq were never able to resolve this dissonance. They tried to protect it by turning “Islamo-Fascism” into the an all encompassing bogeyman that seemed to cover all the bad guys – Saddam and the Ayatollahs; Al Qaeda and Hizbolah; the Taliban and Hamas– while not dwelling on the role of that the Saudis and the Pakistan had played in the story.\nThey even provided the narrative with a Happy End – the ushering of the age of liberal democracy in the Middle East though the use of American military power. That the story ended with a stronger Iran, the rise of Islamic State (IS), and the return of the Taliban: well that would have to wait for another narrative.\nSo perhaps it’s not surprising that the same cast of narrative writers in Washington who were responsible for that foreign policy flop, are now trying to employ their creative talents to come-up with new story lines that would help convince us that once again the international system was dominated by a struggle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. And guess which side we are on?\nFor a while it seemed as though the reality of international relations was anything but Manichean, with the Middle East degenerating into a struggle over power between a few allies (Turkey; the Kurds; Israel); not very-nice players who happen to be our friends (Saudi Arabia; Egypt); the bad ones (Iran; Syria; Hizbolah; Hamas), and the devil incarnate (IS) that happened to be a killing machine that owes its radical Islamist ideology to the Wahhabi teachers in Saudi Arabia. Not to mention Al Qaeda and its many political satellites that were located now somewhere between the bad ones and the devil incarnate.\nThat was kind of a bummer, if you plan to write a script for a western in which the noble protagonists fight the evil antagonists, as opposed to a post-modern David Lynch movie with its tormenting moral ambiguity, which unfortunately is how the international system looks quite frequently.\nRussia’s military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 and West was encouraging in a sense that it helped to cast Vladimir Putin as the new global villain. That Putin strengthened Russia’s ties with its old client state Syria and maintained friendly ties with Iran, allowed the creative juices of the narrative writers to start flowing again and to identify the new forces of darkness: The authoritarian Putin; the murderous Bashar Assad; and the Ayatollahs in Tehran.\nNever mind that the secular Assad and for that matter, Iran, were fighting the IS and other radical Sunni Islamist groups. Or that Russia had to protect legitimate strategic interests in the Middle East and was strengthening its ties with a U.S. ally, Israel. Or that Turkey was at one point allied with Assad, that it was an adversary of the Kurds and in the midst of a major diplomatic confrontation with Israel, and that together with the Saudis, Ankara helped support radical Sunni Islamist groups.\nIndeed, it was becoming more and more difficult to cast Turkey’s Recap Tayyip Erdogan, who like Putin was accused of projecting authoritarian tendencies, as the good guy in the evolving narrative, especially after the Turks shot-down a Russian warplane on its border with Syria in November 2015, raising the specter of a war between the Russians and the Turks.\nBut not to worry: Amid the tensions between Ankara and the West in the aftermath of the attempted military coup in Turkey, and as the two countries struggled with their flagging economies, Moscow and Ankara decided to patch their relations, leading to a meeting between Erdogan and Putin in Moscow.\nJudging by the reaction of the foreign policy crowd in Washington, the meeting was nothing short of an historic summit, a turning point in the Middle East politics that could reshape the global balance of balance: The supposedly two anti-Eastern authoritarian leaders, are cooperating with the other force of darkness, Iran, in shoring up Assad brutal regime and check mating the United States.\nIt almost goes without saying that this storyline is farfetched when one takes into consideration that Turkey is an important member of NATO and is seeking membership in the European Union (EU). Just count how many times President Barack Obama has met with Erdogan. And Turkey (like in the case of Russia), continues to hold free and democratic elections (certainly more open than those held in “liberated” Iraq or in Egypt).\nThere is no question that there are serious disagreements between the U.S. and Turkey – as there are between Russia and Turkey or between the Russia and the United States -- over the strategy of bringing an end to the civil war in Syria as well as over Kurdish issue. But those disagreements would not necessarily disappear if a more secular and liberal government had led Turkey.\nOn one level, scripting Manichean foreign policy narratives is at best an intriguing intellectual exercise. But at worst, it can impact the foreign policy discourse in Washington; in the way the neoconservative narrative helped shape public perception of policy after 9/11, creating the conditions for the decision to invade Iraq."

Earlier this month, Revolve announced a round of layoffs in the photo department of its Cerritos headquarters, and sources who spoke to Jezebel believe the company’s seemingly endless budget for mega influencer events—including a Kim Kardashian appearance in the Hamptons—may be coming at the expense of those jobs.\nTwo Revolve employees (both spoke to me over the phone under the condition of anonymity to avoid penalty) said Revolve co-founder Mike Karanikolas held a meeting on June 17 and announced that the company was laying off the majority of its photo editing team—which is responsible for acquiring and editing photos and editorials that appear on the site—to save on operational costs.\nOne staff member also said people who lost their jobs were offered severance packages that will only be issued if they remain at Revolve until their official termination date, which is months down the line. Some employees will stay on until September, while others will remain until November or January, after which their jobs will be outsourced to workers in another country (two employees, one current and one former, specifically said the Philippines). Employees appear to be cautious about publicly discussing the layoffs to avoid jeopardizing their future severance.\nIn June, we notified a small number of employees that they will likely be let go between the months of September and January, as we shift certain work to a 3rd party provider. All affected employees were provided at least several months advance notice, and all were additionally provided severance packages including salary and health coverage, as well as assistance locating other career opportunities. While fewer than ten employees were affected by the changes, we sympathize with their situation, and are doing our best to assist them going forward.\nWe don’t anticipate any other operational changes of this nature and the company will continue to hire and build the team as the business continues to grow.\nExpenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE, which employs hundreds of individuals. We generally do not comment on marketing expenditures, but we will say in this case the information reported by the press was inaccurate.\nThe inaccuracy she’s referring to are reports that Kim Kardashian was paid $700,000 to host a Revolve Hamptons event this summer. According to the laid-off employees I spoke to, it’s the optics of excess spending that make the layoffs feel more offensive. Perhaps what’s happening is an overlap of their personal disappointment about losing a job and the natural effects of a company that’s prioritizing public image.\nStill, like other fashion outlets, Revolve relies heavily on celebrities and influencers for a marketing boost. Nicole Richie collaborated on a line, stars like Kendall and Kylie Jenner have sold a collection on their site, and style bloggers are frequently sent on trips to promote the brand. Such events have become the lifeblood of Revolve.\nIn addition to taking care of their travel and accommodations, Revolve gifted each influencer with a sizable clothing credit — a source close to the participating talent tells us $2,000 is standard — in addition to paying his or her appearance fee. And for certain agency-backed bloggers, like Bernstein and Bazan, who are both represented by Next Models, this can easily run in the tens of thousands of dollars.\nThe first Revolve employee I spoke to who was part of the layoffs told me the company’s decision to hire Kardashian angered staff members who’d been let go. Kim reportedly spent an hour at the party, where she was seen “taking numerous selfies with influencers,” Page Six reported.\nAlso in attendance were fashion insiders like stylist Chriselle Lim, blogger Arielle Charnas and DJ Amy Pham.\nGerona responded to my question about the Kardashian event in her email above with: “Expenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE.” Gerona also declined to comment on how much Kardashian was paid for the event.\nWhy the huge cost for Kardashian’s brief appearance? It’s all part of Revolve’s big picture marketing strategy to show clothes in context so customers aspire to wear them — and in turn, buy them. (Google recently released a study that found this tactic influences 64 percent of women to make a purchase on their smartphones.) When the brand isn’t hosting parties in the Hamptons, it’s sending fashion bloggers on epic, scenic trips around the world — Jamaica, Mexico, Croatia, etc. — dressed in the e-tailer’s latest offerings.\nThe employee estimated that the average photo editor’s salary at Revolve is around $36,000. Some of the laid-off staffers first heard about the Kardashian appearance when a fed-up ex-employee railed about it in a scathing Instagram post and tweet posted on July 19.\nWhen I spoke to Estrada over the phone, he said the photo editing team at Revolve is responsible for “pretty much about 95 percent of the website” and that employees who were laid off but still working—some of whom he’s remained friends with and have expressed grievances to him, he says—have been tasked with making the outsourcing a smooth transition.\nWhen asked whether the recent layoffs could simply be viewed as a common, unfortunate result of a growing company’s bureaucratic decisions, Estrada noted that cost-cutting could have been directed elsewhere.\nUPDATE (3:40 p.m.): This post has been updated with additional comments from Revolve’s brand and marketing rep Raissa Gerona."

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is opposed to even limited U.S. military intervention in Syria because it believes rebels fighting the Assad regime wouldn't support American interests if they were to seize power right now, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote to a congressman in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.\nEffectively ruling out U.S. cruise missile attacks and other options that wouldn't require U.S. troops on the ground, Dempsey said the military is clearly capable of taking out Syrian President Bashar Assad's air force and shifting the balance of the Arab country's 2 1/2-year war back toward the armed opposition. But he said such an approach would plunge the United States deep into another war in the Arab world and offer no strategy for peace in a nation plagued by ethnic rivalries.\n\"Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,\" Dempsey said in the letter Aug. 19 to Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \"It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.\"\nDempsey's pessimistic assessment will hardly please members of the fractured Syrian opposition leadership and some members of the administration who have championed greater support to help the rebellion end Assad's four-decade family dynasty. Despite almost incessant bickering and internal disputes, some opposition groups have worked with the United States and other European and Arab supporters to try to form a cohesive, inclusive movement dedicated to a democratic and multiethnic state.\nBut those fighting the Assad government range wildly in political and ethnic beliefs and not all are interested in Western support.\nAs the conflict has gone on, killing more than 100,000 people and ripping apart the delicate sectarian fabric of Syrian society, al-Qaida-linked rebels and other extremist groups have been responsible for some of the same types of massacres and ethnic attacks that the Assad regime has committed. On Tuesday, Kurdish militias battled against al-Qaida-linked fighters in the northeast in fighting that has fueled a mass exodus of refugees into Iraq and risks exploding into a full-blown side conflict.\nDempsey said Syria's war was \"tragic and complex.\"\n\"It is a deeply rooted, long-term conflict among multiple factions, and violent struggles for power will continue after Assad's rule ends,\" he wrote. \"We should evaluate the effectiveness of limited military options in this context.\"\nOn Wednesday, two Syrian pro-opposition groups claimed that government forces carried out a \"poisonous gas\" attack near the capital, Damascus, leaving dozens of people dead. There was no government comment on the claims and the reports could not be independently confirmed.\nDespite calling for Assad to leave power in 2011, President Barack Obama has steadfastly refused to allow the U.S. to be drawn directly into the conflict. Officials have said for the past couple of months, however, that the U.S. is prepared to provide lethal aid to vetted, moderate units among the opposition ranks. It's unclear what, if any, weapons have been delivered so far.\nDempsey's letter to Engel was another follow-up to a sharp examination he faced in July from the Senate Armed Services Committee ahead of a reconfirmation vote. Unable to answer questions by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, Dempsey sent a letter afterward saying the establishment of a no-fly zone to protect the Syrian rebels would require hundreds of U.S. aircraft at a cost as much as $1 billion a month and with no assurance that it would change the war's momentum.\nHe also discouraged options such as training vetted rebel groups, limited strikes on Syria's air defenses and creating a buffer zone for the opposition, stressing the need to avoid an outcome similar to Iraq or Afghanistan by preserving a functioning state for any future power transfer. And he cited risks such as lost U.S. aircraft.\nEngel, another advocate of more forceful U.S. action, joined the debate by proposing the use of cruise missiles and other weapons against Syrian government-controlled air bases in an Aug. 5 letter to Dempsey. The congressman said such strikes would ground Assad's air force and reduce the flow of weapons to his government from Iran and Russia, while costing less to U.S. taxpayers and requiring no American troops on the ground in Syria or in its airspace.\nDempsey said this approach wouldn't tip the balance against Assad and wouldn't solve the deeper problems plaguing Syria.\n\"We can destroy the Syrian air force,\" he said. \"The loss of Assad's air force would negate his ability to attack opposition forces from the air, but it would also escalate and potentially further commit the United States to the conflict. Stated another way, it would not be militarily decisive, but it would commit us decisively to the conflict.\"\n\"The use of U.S. military force can change the military balance,\" Dempsey added. \"But it cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict.\"\nInstead, he spoke in favor of an expansion of the Obama administration's current policy.\nThe U.S. can provide far greater humanitarian assistance and, if asked, do more to bolster a moderate opposition in Syria. Such an approach \"represents the best framework for an effective U.S. strategy toward Syria,\" Dempsey said."

        "text": "WASHINGTON, March 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its commitment to building healthier communities, CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) today announced it has provided a total of $79,566 in grants through the CVS Health Foundation to four colleges and universities in Massachusetts to advocate for, adopt, and implement 100 percent smoke- and tobacco-free campus policies, including limiting the use of e-cigarettes. The four schools include Roxbury Community College, Bay Path University in Longmeadow, Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley and the Urban College of Boston.\nThe new recipients are part of a more than $1.4 million grant pool to 82 schools across the country. Delivered in partnership with the American Cancer Society and Truth Initiative, the grants build upon the three organizations' combined commitment to helping deliver a tobacco-free generation.\nThe funding announced today will help accelerate and expand the number of campuses across the country that prohibit smoking, e-cigarette, and other tobacco product use. While conventional cigarette smoking among high school students has fallen by almost 50 percent since 2011, e-cigarette use has surged over the last year, especially among young people—there are 2.8 million young adults aged 18-24 who are current e-cigarette users. The spread of e-cigarettes risks a reversal of the progress made in reducing smoking over the last two decades given that young people who vape are four times more likely to begin smoking cigarettes in the future.\n\"A critical goal in building healthier communities across the country is reducing tobacco-use, which remains one of the leading causes of preventable death in this country,\" said Eileen Howard Boone, President of the CVS Health Foundation. \"By helping more colleges and universities explore and execute on tobacco-free policies, we're able to positively influence the number of new college-age smokers and get one step closer to our goal of seeing the first tobacco-free generation.\"\nThe grants are part of Be The First, CVS Health's five-year, $50 million initiative to deliver the nation's first tobacco-free generation, which is a major program within the company's new $100 million Building Healthier Communities initiative. While the number of U.S. colleges and universities that are smoke- or tobacco-free has doubled since 2012, approximately half of the nearly 5,000 schools across the country still have no comprehensive policy in place.\nWith the CVS Health Foundation's support, the American Cancer Society and Truth Initiative programs help students, faculty and staff develop and execute strategies that are customized to meet the unique needs of each campus and move the schools toward a 100 percent smoke- and tobacco-free environment. Together, the organizations have provided financial and technical support to more than 200 colleges and universities since 2016, helping to clear the air for more than one million students.\n\"While the teen smoking rate has fallen to an all-time low of 4.6 percent, the rapid rise in e-cigarette use threatens to erase this progress given youth who vape are four times more likely to progress to smoking deadly cigarettes,\" said Robin Koval, CEO and President of Truth Initiative. \"Over the years, we've had great success in working with colleges to go smoke- and tobacco-free. They now play a critical role in also addressing the e-cigarette epidemic as vaping becomes even more prevalent on campuses across the U.S. Together with our partners, we look forward to empowering as many colleges and universities as possible with the information and resources they need to end all tobacco use for good.\"\n\"Cigarettes cause more than 480,000 U.S. deaths annually and are responsible for nearly 29 percent of all cancer deaths in the U.S.,\" said Gary Reedy, CEO of the American Cancer Society. \"College is a time when young adults are susceptible to developing or perpetuating an addiction to nicotine and tobacco. This partnership continues to enable us to help reduce tobacco use among college students and therefore reduce the number of people impacted by tobacco-related diseases.\"\nTo see the full list of colleges supported by these grants and for more information on the grant application process, please visit http://www.cvshealth.com/smartcampusesquit.\nCVS Health is the nation's premier health innovation company helping people on their path to better health.

        "text": "Subarus are very popular in New England. So how do three crossovers – the Outback, Crosstrek, and Forester – stack up against each other?\nIf you’re in the market for a smallish SUV or crossover (those terms have become pretty much interchangeable these days), choosing which brands to compare is one challenge.\nBut what if you’ve already picked your brand? We have. Today’s column explains the differences among Subaru’s three crossover offerings.\nWhy Subaru? Because it’s the ultimate New England fallback for the region’s winter climate.\nMost folks reading this know a bit about Subarus; namely, that they: 1) are a popular vehicle in New England; 2) last a long time; 3) have a time-tested all-wheel-drive system; 4) and all look somewhat alike.\nBut ask those same folks to describe the differences among the Outback, Forester, and XV CrossTtrek, and you’re liable to get a blank stare.\nMo¬st of us recognize the models, but are hard-pressed to single out what’s distinctive about each one.\nThe differences are real. The Outback is longer, the Forester is higher and has a higher cargo area, especially important if you’ve got a good-sized dog, and the XV CrossTrek definitely has an edgy, more aggressive look, in large part because of its fancy wheels. It’s also the only one that comes in tangerine orange, a color that definitely goes outside the Subaru mainstream.\nHere’s a capsule look at each vehicle, replete with random tangential thoughts. We’re comparing the three, each in mid-range premium trim with the CVT transmission.\nFrankly, because it looks like a second cousin to a Volvo SUV, we thought the Outback was the smallest member of the family. Actually, it happens to be the longest, fitting into the midsize crossover category. It’s got a longer wheelbase (by 4-plus inches) than the other two and is significantly longer overall (189.6 inches compared to 180.9 for the Forester and 175.2 for the XV Crosstrek). It’s also wider than the others (72.4 inches compared to 70.7 for the Forester and 70.1 for the XV Crosstrek).\nThe Outback also happens to be Subaru’s No. 1 seller. In our comparison trim, it has a price of $27,845.\nEven though it has a more aerodynamic appearance, the Outback has the most cubic feet of cargo space with 73.3 compared to 68.5 for the Forester and 51.9 for the Crosstrek.\nThe Outback isn’t available with a manual transmission, but it is the only one of the three you can get with a six-cylinder engine—the 3.6-liter optional offering.\nFor techies, the new Outback is available with (meaning at extra cost) the second-generation of Subaru’s award-winning (top Safety pick+) Eyesight system with adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, pre-collision braking, rear cross-traffic alert, and blind spot warning. Drive with this system for a week and there’s no going back.\nThe basic Outback shares the same 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with the Forester but, for some reason, gets 175 horsepower compared to the Forester’s 170.\nThe Forester and XV Crosstrek are built on the same platform. They have basically the same 103-inch wheelbase and share the same car-based platform. However, the Crosstrek is more than 5 inches shorter overall.\nBoth fit into the compact crossover category; however, the Forester has a maximum cargo space (with rear seats folded) of 68.5 cubic feet compared to the Crosstrek’s 51.9 cubic feet.\nAlso, while they both have Subaru’s CVT transmission, the Forester has a bigger 2.5-liter engine with 170 horsepower compared to the XV Crosstrek’s 2.0-liter with 148 hp.\nSubaru people say the Forester is more of a family car (for a small family) and the most dog-friendly (a big Subaru talking point) because its higher roofline lets larger dogs sit upright.\nIn our mid-range configuration, the Forester has an MSRP of $25,945. That’s almost $2,000 less than the Outback, which does have more standard features.\nThe Forester also offers a massive optional moonroof. Visibility for the driver arguably is as good as any vehicle on the market.\nFor those who haven’t given in and conceded that CVTs offer better fuel economy than manual transmissions, the Forester still can be had with a manual.\nIt’s cool. It’s sporty. It’s more aggressively styled. It’s less expensive.\nWhile the Forester might be a better choice for a family, the Crosstrek is a great choice for a single person or a couple.\nFor a crossover, it has impressive fuel economy figures of 26 city and 34 highway.\nIts shorter length makes it easier to park.\nLike all three of our Subarus, it has 8.7 inches of ground clearance. In a year when we’ve had more than 100 inches of snow, it’s nice to know that if this 3,000-plus pound car can pack the snow down to 9 inches, it can go most anyplace.\nThe XV Crosstrek’s price is $24,145 in a similar premium configuration, making it a good choice if you don’t need the size of the Outback or the squarer configuration of the Forester.\nSo what’s the bottom line? Simple. You can’t go wrong with any of these Subarus, but this comparison may help you decide which best fits your lifestyle."

Falzone can barely handle the agony, as she covers her mouth with a napkin. \"I can't, I can't swallow it. I can't. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.\"\nShe then pauses, drinks some water, and drinks some more water before going in for the kill. \"I don't want to say this, but it tastes like throw up.\"\nAnother of the taste testers, traffic reporter Robb Westaby, chimes in: \"It is an acquired taste, one I don't want to acquire ever again.\"\n\"I took one bite and I think that is my lifetime limit,\" morning news anchor Mike Avery adds.\nFeeding Americans Vegemite and filming it has become an Australian national pastime. First, we fed it to the children. Then we disguised it in a cheesy pizza crust and fed it to anyone who would listen to make a Pizza Hut ad."

        "text": "North Dakota's energy boom led the state to have the fastest-growing economy in 2012, increasing at five times the national average.\nPropelled by a massive energy boom, North Dakota once again captured the title of the nation's hottest economy, with a growth rate five times the national average.\nNorth Dakota's economy posted a 13.4% growth rate in 2012, according to a report released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That's nearly three times as fast as the number two state, Texas, and trounces the national average of 2.5%.\nThis is the third year in a row that North Dakota took the top spot in BEA's state-by-state report on gross domestic product (GDP). The muscle behind the boom is a surge in oil production from the Bakken Shale, an underground rock formation in the northwestern part of the state.\nThanks to high oil prices and new drilling technology -- including the controversial hydraulic fracturing, better known as \"fracking\" -- oil production in North Dakota is now six times higher than it was in 2007. In 2012, North Dakota surpassed Alaska and California to become the second largest oil-producing state in the nation behind Texas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nThe boom has attracted workers from all over the country and rippled out to incorporate not only the oil and gas drilling sectors but also other industries that supply them, including wholesale goods and transportation.\n\"There's nothing like an oil boom to get things rolling,\" North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple told CNNMoney.\nUnlike some other states, North Dakota has a tax specifically targeting oil and gas production. That tax has allowed the state government to cover 80% of the cost of public schools, greatly reducing property taxes on the local level, Dalrymple said. It also allowed for a reduction in state income taxes, and covered the cost of building roads and other infrastructure to accommodate the influx of workers.\nThere are still downsides to the rapid growth. Housing prices in parts of the state are as high as Manhattan, and some areas are having problems obtaining enough water. But the state's unemployment rate is below 3%, and North Dakota is \"hanging on to our college graduates like we never have before,\" Dalrymple said.\nOil and gas is the biggest economic driver, but Dalrymple said his state is also doing a good job attracting other industries. Deere & Co. (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) are building factories in the state, and an Amazon (AMZN) service center is also in the works.\nThe second fastest-growing state was Texas, which benefited from oil and gas activity in its own shale formations as well as a strong showing in its manufacturing sector.\nIn fact, the manufacturing of durable goods -- things that last longer than three years, such as cars, appliances or software -- grew by more than 9% nationwide in 2012, according the BEA. It was the leading contributor to growth in 22 states, the bureau said.\nIn Oregon -- the third fastest-growing state -- manufacturing contributed almost 3 percentage points to the state's GDP.\nComputers and electronics dominate Oregon's manufacturing industry, with Intel (INTC) in particular leading the way, said Josh Lehner, a state economist. The company has been expanding its chip manufacturing plants, as well as its research and development unit in the state.\nWashington and Minnesota rounded out the five fastest-growing states. Washington's growth was led by tech and manufacturing, while manufacturing and finance fueled Minnesota's.\nThe laggards: Connecticut was the only state to see an actual drop in economic activity, with its gross domestic product falling by 0.1%. Connecticut has a large insurance and finance sector, which posted a fairly sharp decline.\nEconomists have said growth in the insurance and finance industry will likely lag other sectors as the market continues to adapt to the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank finance reform bill, the implementation details of which are still being worked out, is also expected to limit the sector's growth.\nDelaware was the second slowest-growing state, dragged down by contractions in the construction and wholesale trade sectors.\nNew Mexico, the fourth slowest-growing state, also saw a decline in its construction sector.\nDeclining construction activity was not the norm nationwide. Construction activity grew by 3.2% across the country in 2012, BEA said -- the first annual growth posted by the sector in eight years.\nSouth Dakota was also a slow-growing state, and had the sector with the biggest single drop: agriculture, which knocked 2 percentage points off the state's GDP growth.\nSouth Dakota is a big cattle-producing state. The drought in the summer of 2012 pushed up the prices of corn and other grains, squeezing profits for ranchers that use the crops for feed."

        "text": "The newest and most expensive carrier ever entered the U.S. Navy fleet Saturday, nearly three years behind schedule and costing about $2.4 billion above plan.\nWhen building the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier, the Navy ditched battle-tested features found on previous carriers and instead went with more expensive technology that hasn't always worked out as expected.\nThe ship isn't expected to be fully operational until at least 2020, and its controversial catapult system hasn't launched an actual aircraft at sea.\nIn this handout photo provided by the U.S. Navy, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) man the rails as the ship departs Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding for builder's sea trials off the U.S. East Coast on April 8, 2017 in Newport News, Virginia.\nThe newest and most expensive aircraft carrier ever built entered the U.S. Navy fleet Saturday, but almost three years behind schedule and billions of dollars over its estimated budget.\nWith Saturday's commissioning, the carrier will go back into testing and training, and isn't expected to be fully operational until 2020 at the earliest. The ship's catapult has yet to launch an actual aircraft at sea and the vessel has only had helicopters land on its deck.\nAlthough it has yet to be put to the test, some already say the USS Gerald R. Ford is an example of the Navy's costly and risky bet on \"immature\" technology.\nExperts say the Navy's decision to roll out some untested technologies in its next-generation classes of ships has been a costly lesson. For example, the new Ford aircraft carrier going into the Navy fleet cost nearly $13 billion, or around $2.4 billion above plan.\nThe Navy \"made a significant bet on the newest and latest cutting-edge technology, and it bet that all of those technologies would mature as these platforms were scheduled to come online,\" said Jerry Hendrix, senior fellow and director of the Defense Strategies and Assessments Program at the Center for a New American Security, a non-partisan Washington think tank.\nHendrix added, \"Unfortunately some of those technologies did not mature. Hence, we're seeing some delays in some critical programs, including the new Ford-Class carrier.\"\nAlthough years behind schedule, the Ford carrier was formally commissioned into the Navy's fleet Saturday in a ceremony in Virginia, which was attended by President Donald Trump. The president had previously visited the carrier in March.\nIn remarks Saturday, Trump called the Ford carrier \"the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of this world.\"\nWhen building the new Ford carrier, the Navy ditched the steam-powered catapult system found on the older Nimitz-Class carriers and went instead with a electro-magnetic aircraft launch system. Similarly, the Navy went with an updated arresting gear to catch planes landing on the ship's deck.\nThe Ford is the first new design of an aircraft carrier in 40 years. Last month, acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley conceded costs of the carriers were tough to swallow, but insisted the service (and shipbuilding industry) planned to learn from past missteps. Meanwhile, the maker of the new digital catapult, General Atomics, claims on its webpage the system's benefits include a \"reduced manning and life-cycle cost.\"\nThe technology replaced the battle-tested steam catapult that had been used for decades to launch planes. As it turns out, though, the commander-in-chief is not at all a fan of the supercarrier's technology. In a May interview, Trump told Time magazine in an interview that the new digital power system \"costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it's no good.\"\nSimilarly, the Navy has faced cost overruns and other problems with other new classes of warships, including internal electrical issues with the Zumwalt-class destroyer, and struggles with the controversial Littoral Combat Ship program.\nTrump alluded to military costs and program delays in his remarks Saturday, but didn't single out the Ford carrier.\n\"We do not want cost overruns,\" the president said. \"We want the best equipment but we want it built ahead of schedule and we want it built under budget.\"\nMandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project On Government Oversight, said some of the mistakes made by the Navy on big-ticket programs have been self-inflicted. The service's tendency to \"develop really complex technology that's expensive to maintain and not reliable,\" has been a major drawback.\nAdded Smithberger, \"It's not necessarily that it's new technology but it's immature — so it has to be proven technology.\"\nSome analysts said the new ideas for the next-generation ships originated in the 1990s, when there was a \"go for broke\" mindset by some decision makers.\nIn the case of the Ford-Class carrier, the Navy decided to make all of the key changes in new technology upfront on the first ship in the class, rather than wait for successive carriers. The Navy plans to spend around $43 billion on the first three Ford-Class aircraft carriers.\nAt the same time, the Navy and other services have faced fiscal challenges due to the ongoing effect of the budget caps signed into law six years ago.\n\"The Budget Control Act, as far as it pertains to defense, was wrong-minded and that should not have been systematically reducing defense spending,\" said Brian Slattery, a policy analyst for national security at Washington-based Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\nHe also said the inability of Congress to pass regular budgets is \"very disruptive\" to Navy and other service programs.\nFor the Navy, though, the budget situation is particularly pressing because of Trump's stated goal for a larger Navy fleet.\nAs a GOP candidate last year, Trump pledged the Navy would build 350 surface ships and submarines. He has since accepted the Navy's new force structure goal of a fleet of 355 ships — up from the battle force of 276 ships as of Friday.\nHowever, reaching the Navy goal could cost approximately $400 billion more over 30 years than the service's previously stated force goal of 308 ships, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nBased on CBO's calculations, the Navy would need to buy around 329 new ships over 30 years to reach the 355-ship fleet. That compares with the 254 ships it estimates would be bought under the Navy's prior force goal.\n\"Cost is probably the biggest challenge reaching the larger fleet size,\" said Smithberger. \"You'd have to increase Pentagon spending a lot to afford everything that they're trying to buy. It will require cutting other services or other Navy priorities, including airplanes.\"\nYet the time it will take to reach a 355-ship Navy also is a concern, given signs the Chinese are aggressively ramping up their own naval forces. Separately, Russia is undergoing a modernization plans of its own, including adding advanced nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines to its fleet.\n\"The Chinese are coming hard, meaning they are going for mass numbers and new advanced technology,\" said Hendrix, of the Center for a New American Security.\n\"The Russians have made decisions to invest in fairly exquisite platforms, like the new Yasen-Class submarine, a nuclear powered, fast-attack boat which is very advanced,\" he added. \"And if they got two or three of those loose in the Atlantic, and we didn't know where they were, it would cause real complications for the United States as well as NATO.\"\nIn April, the nonpartisan CBO estimated the earliest the Navy could reach the 355-ship goal was by 2035, though it cautioned that 15-year buildup forecast was based on the service getting \"sufficient funding.\" The CBO also estimates the cost to build, crew and operate the larger fleet would average $102 billion annually through 2047.\nRegardless, Hendrix suggests there is perhaps a faster way to reach the 355-ship fleet size but not necessarily by adding newly constructed ships. Instead, he suggests the Navy might want to consider taking ships out of mothballs and keeping others in service longer to maintain the 355-ship fleet.\nOthers are not so sure it makes sense to keep ships in the fleet longer than they are scheduled.\n\"You can't just run the same ships well beyond their service lives to assume that you can keep up the same level of capability to deter our adversaries,\" said Slattery.\nHendrix said another option to increase the size of the Navy fleet is to look at some vessels in the so-called Ready Reserve Force ships, which are maintained for national defense and emergencies.\nEither way, he believes there's an urgent need to reach that 355-ship target sooner rather than later. The retired Navy captain insisted the Navy should strive to reach the 355-ship fleet \"within a decade in order to deter both the Chinese and Russians who are looking to challenge us at sea.\""

        "text": "Kerth, 67, was selected from 164 applicants to be the organization’s new chief executive. He sits on the board of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and is a scion of the Kerth family who founded the American Ice Co. and the Iceland skating rink in North Sacramento. He is responsible for the design of ice rinks in what’s now called Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento and an outdoor rink at Squaw Valley’s High Camp in 1990.\nVeteran nonprofit leader Pam Saltenberger, who served as Sacramento Habitat’s interim CEO for about six months, said she and other members of the executive search team felt that Kerth’s experience in the political arena would help the organization lead and navigate discussions about how governments and nonprofits can work together to ensure there’s adequate housing for low-income residents.\nThe loss of government funding is not the only challenge for the Sacramento Habitat, which has a budget of $5.9 million for the fiscal year ending in June. Nationwide, Habitat affilitates have begun hearing from some corporate sponsors that want their dollars stretched to help more than just one family.\nHabitat affiliates across the country have begun offering neighborhood revitalization programs, and the Sacramento-based organization launched its effort last year with a work project in West Sacramento. Habitat volunteers worked on several homes in one neighborhood, doing things like replacing building materials damaged by dry rot, painting homes, fixing or putting on new roofs.\nKerth said that, as a community activist and politician, he’s seen a new Habitat home turn around neighborhood decay as well.\nThe Sacramento Habitat affiliate has begun to put particular emphasis on interfaith home-building projects, an endeavor that Saltenberg said has taken off with advocacy from board member Jeff vonKaenel, publisher of the Sacramento News & Review. Essentially, she and Kerth said, it’s an opportunity for people of all faiths to sponsor a home, volunteer to work on a home-building project or do both.\nThe idea is that, if people of all faiths can work beside each other for a common goal, they can share faith stories if they choose and gain understanding to stem the tide of any negative rhetoric that rises against one particular faith, Saltenberger said.\nAnd, they will be working side by side with the person selected to buy the Habitat home, said Kerth, who served on the Sacramento City Council from 1992-2000. He stressed that Habitat is not a giveaway program. Those who qualify to buy a home pay for it with their sweat equity and a no-interest mortgage. Their payments ensure that the organization can continue its mission."

        "text": "Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have joined a record-setting cohort of independents and MPs from'unrecognized' parties.\nIf a group of crows is called a'murder', an assembly of ferrets is a'business' and a collection of owls is a'parliament', what do you call a row of independent MPs?\nA'schism' of independents? A'motley', perhaps? How about an'insurrection'?\nWith the ejection of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus this week, the number of independent MPs in the House of Commons has exploded. Coupled with the other MPs representing an array of'unrecognized' parties ranging from the secessionist to the populist and the extinct, the number of MPs in the House who do not belong to officially recognized parties is at an all-time high.\nThere are now seven Independents in the House. Along with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, the list includes former Liberals Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Raj Grewal, Darshan Kang and Hunter Tootoo, as well as Tony Clement, a former Conservative.\nThat's not an abnormally high number for the tail end of a majority government's term. There were eight independents when the House was dissolved ahead of the 2015 federal election. There were nine just before the 2004 election.\nThe number of Independents hit a modern high in 1990 as well, when there were 11 of them in the House — the bulk of them former Liberal or PC MPs who eventually would form the Bloc Québécois.\nBut any party with less than 12 seats in the House of Commons goes \"unrecognized\" — which means it isn't guaranteed slots in question period, seats on committees or the extra resources that are awarded to larger parties. Instead, these parties need to share their speaking time in the House with other Independents; in the current Parliament, that means 14 questions a week are divvied up between the 20 MPs from unrecognized parties or sitting as Independents.\nThose unrecognized parties are the Bloc Québécois (10 MPs), Greens (Elizabeth May) and the People's Party (Maxime Bernier).\nThen there's Erin Weir, who was booted from the New Democratic caucus last year. He is sitting as a self-appointed member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a forerunner party to the NDP that has not existed for more than half a century.\nWeir has been pushing Speaker Geoff Regan for more questions for the growing crew of Independents.\n\"The independent group is by far the fastest-growing parliamentary caucus,\" Weir said in a statement following Caesar-Chavannes's departure from the Liberal caucus in March. \"We need more spots in question period to reflect our numbers.\"\nHe repeated that call this week when the cohort of Independents grew by two.\nIn an October 2018 ruling, Regan said that the 14 questions awarded to Independents was already high, adding that \"never have independent members been recognized as much during question period.\" He also reminded the House that question period is only supposed to last 45 minutes and the additional questions given to Independents are already routinely pushing question period well beyond that duration.\nSmall parties only began receiving recognition in the House in 1963, during a period of minority governments when the New Democrats and Social Credit held a lot of sway in the legislature. At the time, the bar of 12 seats was set to give leaders of these smaller parties a bump in salary, like the one given to the leader of the Official Opposition. The threshold of 12 seats then evolved to become the benchmark for a number of other parliamentary privileges.\nWatch Vassy Kapelos explain what it means to be an independent MP.\nTheoretically, Weir could acquire these privileges by getting his unrecognized colleagues to form a caucus of their own — like the Independent Senators Group in the Senate.\nOf course, that would mean somehow uniting Caesar-Chavannes, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould with Kang, Tootoo, Clement and Grewal — Independents who are alleged to have committed, or have admitted to committing, various improprieties. It also would require finding common ground between May and Bernier and getting the Bloc on board.\nParliament has seen plenty of caucuses divided against themselves, but such an Independent caucus would set a new bar for internal turmoil. Obviously, it isn't happening.\nBut the numbers make it possible — which is pretty remarkable on its own.\nAt the end of the last Parliament, the total number of Independents and MPs from unrecognized parties just ticked over the 12-seat threshold. But that also was a group of MPs with irreconcilable differences — representatives of the Greens, the Bloc and Strength in Democracy (remember them?), along with a clutch of cast-off Independents.\nBefore that, you have to go back to the 35th Parliament that sat between 1994 and 1997 and included nine New Democrats and two Progressive Conservatives. Add the handful of independents at that time to the mix, and you could have had an unrecognizable — but nevertheless'recognized' — party.\nBut while it's a bit odd to see so many MPs in the House who don't belong to a recognized party, it's far from unprecedented. What is unique about this group is the large number of them who have held high office in the past.\nAccording to the database maintained by the Library of Parliament, only 18 former cabinet ministers have ever appeared in the Commons as Independents. Of those, four (five if we include Bernier, who briefly sat as an Independent before changing his affiliation to the People's Party) are now sitting in the House of Commons. That's twice the largest number of \"honourable members\" that ever sat previously as independents at the same time.\nThat's a coincidence, of course: very little connects former cabinet ministers Tootoo and Clement to Philpott and Wilson-Raybould, apart from the bad view they now have in the House. But it's another reminder, if any was needed, that the last two months have nudged federal politics into uncharted territory."

        "text": "Steve Bannon spoke Tuesday in Fairhope, Ala., during a rally for US Senate candidate Roy Moore.\nFAIRHOPE, Ala. — It already felt a little like a victory party in Alabama Tuesday, where Senate candidate Roy Moore is suddenly feeling love from the Republican Party despite weeks of disclosures that he sexually pursued and assaulted underaged girls.\nThere was a barn packed, standing room only, with supporters. American flags and twinkling white lights decorated the interior, while rain occasionally pounded on a tin roof. And Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist turned king-maker, was here to help push Moore over the finish line with his trademark defiance.\n“They want to destroy Judge Moore. And you know why? They want to take your voice away,” Bannon declared.\n“There is no better way to spend a rainy evening in Alabama than with the deplorables,” he said, playing to the antiestablishment crowd gathered to hear him Tuesday night.\nThe neck-and-neck special election contest in Alabama has become, for Bannon, the most extreme example of his “honey badger don’t give a [expletive]”-style of politics, a philosophy inspired by a viral video that shows a badger chasing a jackal and fighting a cobra in search of food. Along the way a narrator explains how the honey badger doesn’t care who he steps on or how disgusting his methods appear to others.\nShould Trump fear a Sen. Romney?\nA Senator Romney would probably serve as the counterweight trying to block President Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party.\nIt is also the first of what Bannon and his ultraright, nationalist allies hope is a movement to elect more outsider candidates to the House and Senate.\nTuesday evening, Bannon also tore into former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a Republican who is a sharp Moore critic and a possible candidate for Senate in Utah if incumbent Senator Orrin Hatch opts to retire.\nBannon’s support in the contest against Democrat Doug Jones has been crucial for Moore, the former renegade state judge and ultraright favorite who has been accused of sexually assaulting teenaged girls when he was a single man in his 30s. The contest, a special election set for Tuesday, is to replace Jeff Sessions who was tapped to be Trump’s attorney general.\nMoore drew parallels between his race here and Trump’s 2016 contest. “He fought both the Democrats and the Republicans and became president of the United States,” Moore said.\n“When he was elected I felt like a big weight had been taken off my shoulders. It felt like we had another chance. And do have another chance,” Moore said.\nRoy Moore kissed his wife Kayla Moore during a campaign event at Oak Hollow Farm.\nThis week marked the beginning of an improbable turnaround, after the renegade Moore, and by proxy, Bannon, appeared headed for a repudiation just a month ago.\nMoore appeared to be in serious trouble after The Washington Post reported early last month that he had sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in the late 1970s and sexually pursued other teenagers. Another woman came forward at a press conference and said Moore sexually assaulted her in a car when she, too, was in high school. Many Republicans distanced themselves from Moore and called on him to drop out of the race.\nBut in a sign of how much the party has changed since Donald Trump’s 2016 election, the president turned the tide back in Moore’s favor two weeks ago, when he said Alabama voters should reject Jones, whom he described as too liberal. This week, Trump explicitly endorsed Moore, the Republican National Committee restored the spigot of campaign cash, and Mitch McConnell moderated his earlier rejection of Moore after the Post’s revelations.\nNow Moore has reestablished a lead in the polls. If he wins, it will be seen as a bigger triumph for Bannon and his far-right movement that has inspired cadres of white nationalists than for Republicans in the Senate. One reason Bannon backs Moore is the sheer discomfort he will bring to Washington.\nSteve Bannon (left) introduced Roy Moore during a campaign rally.\n“He’s going to make McConnell’s life a living hell,” said Andrew Surabian, a former Trump White House aide and Bannon confidant.\nParticularly in this moment of reckoning about sexual misconduct by powerful men, adding Moore to the Senate — with the president’s blessing — will further radicalize the Republican Party and redefine the boundaries of acceptable behavior for membership in the country’s most esteemed body, according to critics from both parties.\nMoore moves the party so far away from the establishment that the previous rebels are suddenly seen as reasonable, Surabian said.\n“Roy Moore will normalize Ted Cruz,” he said, referring to the Texas senator whose antics contributed to a temporary government shutdown in 2013.\nThe president was already planning a trip Friday to Pensacola, Fla., a city that’s so close to the Alabama border it’s in a region of the state known as Flora-bama.\nGinger Poynter and other protesters who said they support the women that are speaking out against Roy Moore gather as he held a campaign rally.\nBut the party is still not united behind Moore, whom many see as an incoming albatross for Republican senators. And Bannon gets the blame. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Romney are among party leaders who have condemned Moore, and Bannon.\nHe noted that McConnell has delivered Trump some legislative victories, including Senate passage last week of a tax cut bill that would also repeal the federal mandate that Americans purchase health insurance, a key tenet of the Affordable Care Act. The GOP-controlled Senate has also confirmed a Supreme Court justice and a raft of judges to the federal bench.\nMoore is still in a close fight with Jones. Polls are showing the Alabama race within the margin of error, which is in some ways stunning given that Trump won Alabama by nearly 28 percentage points.\nJones is a former federal prosecutor who helped jail the man responsible for bombing the Atlanta Olympics. While in his federal post, he landed convictions for two Ku Klux Klansmen who bombed a church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four little girls.\nBannon, 64, took over Trump’s struggling campaign in August 2016 when polls suggested little room for a Republican victory. He went on to become Trump’s chief strategist in the White House.\nBut it’s been since leaving the West Wing in August that Bannon has emerged as a national figure in his own right. On Tuesday, Bannon announced he would return to hosting a morning radio show SiriusXM radio. That’s in addition to his perch atop Breitbart News Network.\nPeople attended a campaign rally for Roy Moore."

The leader of the free world received 12 stitches in his upper lip. Decerega took four stitches in his right elbow and the weight of the world on his mind.\nAfter The Elbow, Decerega crafted a short statement that the White House released, calling the president “a tough competitor and good sport” and then asking for privacy.\nHe focused instead on his jobs as programs director for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute and as a basketball trainer and coach.\nHe became a US citizen, and the first ballot he cast was for Obama in 2008.\nBasketball helped him in life, he says.\nA former history teacher, he has coached basketball for elementary and junior high students for the past 20 years. He got his master’s degree and headed to Capitol Hill, where he helped develop a pipeline for future Latino leaders.\nHis accomplishments were impressive. The Spanish Embassy sent him to Spain as a young leader; he attended an executive leadership program at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government; and he was chosen by MillerCoors in 2010 as one of a dozen top Hispanic leaders for achievement, vision, and commitment.\nHe also started training young players for One on One Basketball Inc., an instruction and event management company that works with players of all ages and skill levels.\nHe spearheaded trips to Panama and the Canary Islands to spread the gospel of basketball.\nToday, none of the kids he has coached knows about The Elbow. “But all the grown-ups do,” he said.\n“It in no way defines him,” said Charles Milligan, whose 11-year-old son Brandon has worked with Decerega for years.\nThe invitation to play with the president came through Arthur Jackson, the founder of One on One Basketball and a former Brown University cocaptain.\n“When I got the invitation, it was like, ‘Wow!’ ” said Decerega. “I was not scared. In my life, basketball has been one of the threads. I just felt I was adding another chapter to my basketball story.\nThe first game was at Camp David, where the presidential seal is at midcourt. Nice Guy Rey was on Obama’s team as a wing guard.\nThe participants were mostly cabinet or family members, younger than the president.\nDecerega, right, instructing Brandon Milligan, is a trainer at One on One Basketball.\nAt 6 feet 1 inch, Decerega is the same height as the president, who played high school ball in Hawaii, but he’s 11 years younger and 20 pounds stockier. Picture a Latino Ernie DiGregorio.\nHe says the lefthanded Obama has got game.\nAnd the commander in chief is not quiet on the court.\nThe president even singled him out for praise.\nIn 2010, Decerega guarded the president during his second pickup game at Fort McNair, the day after Thanksgiving.\nReports on whether the president gets special treatment on the court are conflicting.\nHall of Famer Scottie Pippen, who played with Obama on Election Day last fall, thinks so.\n“I thought they were bringing the whole motorcade through the lane it was so wide,” Pippen told Bulls.com.\nDecerega, who was not invited back after The Elbow, says the leader of the free world is treated like any other guy in T-shirt, shorts, and sneakers.\n“If you didn’t know, someone would have to tell you which player is the president,” he said.\nWhen it comes time to discussing The Elbow, Decerega hesitates before speaking.\nDecerega shoots both his hands skyward, demonstrating what Obama did that day.\n“He was crowding me,” he said. “Instinctively, you crowd the person you’re guarding once he stops his dribble. And instinctively, as the offensive person, I felt the pressure, so I was trying to clear some space. You swing your arms to see what options you have.\n“So I swung the ball from my left side to my right side. And in that swing — I’m obviously leading with this elbow — I hit him in the lip and he fell to the ground from the contact. And that’s a very surreal moment.\n“I didn’t know what had happened, so I looked at my elbow and there’s blood coming from my elbow,” he said. “He was just holding his lip on the floor. He didn’t yell.\nThe Secret Service didn’t tackle Decerega; initially, in fact, no one said anything to him.\nThe president returned to the White House for stitches and ice packs.\nDecerega drove himself to Alexandria Hospital and told the doctors he injured himself playing pickup basketball. He never mentioned Obama.\nCNN’s Wolf Blitzer was on his trail. He received e-mails from haters who said he should have hit the president harder. His sister in Indianapolis was contacted. His mother was worried that there would be physical reprisals.\nDecerega was having trouble sleeping. Then he remembered the advice of his old high school coach at St. Stephen’s, Win Palmer.\n“He taught me to be a class act in everything you do,” said Decerega.\nHe penned a note of apology and sent it to the White House, then tried to concentrate on work.\nThree days later, he received a large gift-wrapped package with the presidential seal on it. It contained a framed three-picture sequence.\n“Him guarding me, me swinging through, and then him holding his mouth,” said Decerega.\nDecerega was more than grateful.\n“I was shocked again,” he said. “I mean, for him to take the time to think about me, and offer me that, it’s an incredible gesture.\nBut Decerega knows that he’ll always be associated with The Elbow."

        "text": "A call center that employed 44 workers in Windsor will close at the end of December as a result of a merger between two nonprofit agencies.\nThe Windsor office of Cerebral Palsy of Colorado, where workers coordinated donation pickups in northern Colorado, had been open since July 1995. It had been at its current location of 1200 Carousel Drive since 1997.\nThe office is merging with the Association of Retarded Citizens, said Rob Miller, director of CPC’s Windsor call center.\nThe consolidation will improve service, he said, giving customers more opportunities for their donated goods, typically clothing and household items, to be collected with fewer phone calls made to their homes.\n“When you have two nonprofits working together, it saves a lot of money. And since they’re nonprofit that means the money saved goes to the bottom line, which is the people that need it,” Miller said.\nThe closure was announced to workers in late October.\nMiller said the organization brought in counselors from the Colorado Workforce Center in Greeley as well as job coaches from the CPC office in Denver.\nJobs at the ARC’s Denver office were made available to the local employees; so far eight workers from the Windsor office have shifted to jobs in Denver.\nSix local truck driving jobs will be unaffected by the closure, Miller said.\nHe emphasized that services provided by the two organizations will be unchanged.\n“Nothing about CPC or ARC changes, no funding, no services, nothing changes with the exception of not calling out off this office,” he said."

        "text": "South Dade will be looking to win its sixth straight Class 3A state title this weekend.\nSouth Dade enters the FHSAA state wrestling tournament this weekend as the favorite to win a sixth-straight Class 3A team title, but not as big a favorite as they’ve been in recent seasons.\nLeading the way for the Bucs are returning state champions Bretli Reyna, Brevin Balmeceda, and Todd Perry.\nTyler Orta, Joshua Swan, and Eric Temes have finished on the podium before and their performances this weekend will go a long way toward assuring South Dade wins another team title.\nChasing South Dade will be Miami-Dade County rival SW Miami.\nThe Eagles will bring nine wrestlers to Kissimmee including 145-pound favorite Julian Hernandez.\nFleming Island brings the most wrestlers in Class 3A with 12 Golden Eagles taking the mat.\nWinter Springs, Hagerty, and Miami Southridge will all be battling for top spots in Class 3A.\nThe action begins on Friday morning with the first round starting at 10 a.m.\nWhat you will read is my best guess as to how Class 3A will play out.\nWhat you will also read is Shannon Heaton’s best guess as to how Class 3A will go.\nThe buzz: This is not an easy path for Rowland, who could face a top 10 wrestler in all four rounds in Kissimmee. The senior is battle-tested this year and I think that will serve him well this weekend. Region 3A-2 is loaded with talent and a few of those guys could switch spots on this podium, just as they’ve exchanged wins this year. Nguyen comes in hot after winning the region crown so he gets the nod. There aren’t many sure things in this bracket and the back end could be as exciting as the front.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Angelo DeDona, Manatee (top half); Zion Gonzalez, University-Orange City (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Morales v. Lens Mathurin (Freedom). Winner has a solid chance to medal.\nThe buzz: Region 2 is, indeed, bringing four hammers to bear in this weight class, and Rowland will have to face at least two of them, perhaps three, to run the gauntlet. By comparison, the bottom half is ever so slightly more balanced but less top heavy, meaning we'll probably see a Region 2 pairing in the semis. What intrigues me most is that potential DeDona-Rios quarter. Going 305 on that one, for the experience factor.\nThe buzz: Wadle started the season strong and he hasn’t let up all season. That doesn't mean it will be an easy walk to the title because Busutil is lurking on the other half of the bracket should Walde get past third-ranked Delgado and fourth-ranked Giraldo. The senior Busutil hasn’t lost to a Class 3A wrestler this season and last lost a match back in Week 7. This will be a great final if it plays out.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Robert Dusendang, Columbus (top half); Joseph Riestra (Cooper City).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Josh Guerra (Riverview) v. Gabe Rendon (Oviedo).\nThe buzz: The instinct is to go chalk with these brackets -- see if you don't next month with your NCAA sheets -- but I agonized a long time over that Wadle/Delgado quarterfinal. I could really see that going the other way. I think it's going to be a monster match. Meanwhile Busutil, who seems to be one of those kids who's been around for years and years, has been building up to this moment, with a bonus point win at Region 4 over Delgado. If Wadle does the same or better, I'll be convinced he's the real deal to become a multi-timer, but experience counts a lot with me.\nThe buzz: Hines won an early season meeting 6-2 against the returning state champion Jackson and gets the nod here but Jackson has been on a winning tear since losing some high profile matches early in the season. Melguizo is the wildcard because he’s the only one with wins this season over both Hines and Jackson and if he can repeat those 4-3 wins, the state title will be heading to the 305.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Tyler Forrest, Riverview (top half); Christian Fields, Freedom (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Huffman v. Forrest. Both could medal.\nThe buzz: Just a monster final set up, with last year's 106 runnerup and 113 champion set to square off. Hines won, 6-2, at Danny Byron, and head-to-head wins matter a lot with me, it's why I made the pick as is. I would just say this, though: a year ago, Palm Harbor's Gabe Naranjo had a prior win over Jackson, too. Jackson's road is much tougher, however, with Huffman and Johnson looming as quarterfinal and semifinal opponents, while Hines should not have much trouble before Saturday's semis, if then.\nThe buzz: Orta and Chopek have been dominant this season with each only having a single loss to wrestlers from Florida (both to Class 2A wrestlers). Both wrestlers are also not strangers to the big state tournament stage as they each have reached the state finals (twice for Chopek) and each is looking for their first state title. I’ll go with the South Dade senior in this one. A potential quarterfinal to not miss would be at the top of the bracket between Kohn and Valdes.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Jose Gonzalez, Southwest Miami (top half); Fredy Rizo, Ferguson (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Rizo v. Dylan Burton (St Thomas Aquinas).\nThe buzz: Khawly-Orta flies under the radar for nationwide buzz that surrounds teammates like Reyna and Balmeceda and Perry, but he's proven steady and capable over the years. Chopek has flourished in his new home, not missing a beat after reaching the 1A finals each of the past two years. Will this be the year he gets over the hump? As he's a former northerner, I hope so. Chopek will have a very tough semi against either Kohn or Valdes, while Orta's path to the final is -- by state wrestling standards -- smoother.\nThe buzz: Reyna is a huge favorite and the top half of this bracket is where the battle will be. It doesn’t hurt that four of the top six wrestlers in the state are in that top half. The freshman Gonzalez has had no growing pains in his first high school wrestling season and he’s part of a young movement in the state that could end up being one of the most talented senior classes ever. But I don’t see anybody getting past the two-time state champion Reyna.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Destin Jones, Miami Palmetto (top half); Travon Rose, Ft Pierce Central (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Jones v. Felix. Both could medal.\nThe buzz: The Now v. The Next. Reyna is one of 3A's superstars, no question, and I think he should roll through this bracket, perhaps even the final, but Gonzalez might be the best freshman in 3A, at any weight. So while the Buccaneer juggernaut is of course the pick, I'd expect a pretty freewheeling final, with a lot of points piled up. Gonzalez's top half of the bracket does appear to be a much stronger half.\nThe buzz: Another big favorite with Lehigh-bound Hines expected to celebrate another state title in front of a home crowd. The bottom half of the bracket is loaded along with Hines so expect some big battles for the podium while a potential semifinal between Swan and Phillips in the top half should have the arena rocking on Saturday morning.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Kyndryck Higgins, Palm Beach Gardens (top half); Dalton Williams, Fleming Island (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Couple of them on the bottom half, but I'll go with one involving my local kid. In the Williams-Dematas match, you could see two kids that reach the final eight.\nThe buzz: It's a swan-song weekend for Hines, and while there's plenty of ranked competition (five kids in the top nine) in his half, I expect him to roll through to the finals. The interesting question might be more who'll be his finals opponent on Saturday night. I'd expect a titanic struggle in the semis between Phillips and Swan; that matchup will generate a lot of attention.\nThe buzz: This is the first weight class with a potential No. 1 vs. No. 2 in the state meeting in the semifinals with Hernandez and Woods both in the top half of the bracket. They’ve met once this season with Hernandez getting a 6-4 win in the finals at the Tri-County Invitational back in Week 9. Contreras has wins over Temes and Janssen this season and will likely need to repeat each accomplishment to reach this final.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: David Milton, Columbus (top half); Will George, Palm Beach Gardens (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Pick any of the Region 1 v 4 matches, but I'll go with Contreras-Temes as a barnburner in round 1.\nThe buzz: Having seen Woods and Contreras several times over the past few years, I know that each of them are a match for top-ranked Hernandez. I wouldn't be surprised to see any of them on top of the podium on Saturday night, but when it comes down to the semis, Woods might be the most-capable guy in the draw. They didn't have a chance to meet up at Knockout, with Woods up at 152, where he was a finalist, where Hernandez was fourth and Contreras fifth at 145.\nThe buzz: Returning state champion Lovett has been one of the most dominating wrestlers in Class 3A this season and I don’t expect that to change. The top half features a monster potential quarterfinal where Villalobos and Winter Springs’ valedictorian McCandless could meet up on Friday evening.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Jonathan Rodriguez, West Port (top half); Gianni Guerriero, St Thomas Aquinas (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Chop v. Guerriero. Winner could make semis, loser has to fight through either McCandless or Villalobos in Saturday blood round.\nThe buzz: Like Hines at 138, this is kind of a swan-song tour for Lovett, who may have surprised a couple of folks with his win last year but won't sneak up on anyone this year as an unbeaten senior. He should sail into the finals, but his opponent might well be determined in Friday night's top quarter between McCandless and Villalobos, which projects to be all-out war.\nThe buzz: Another chance to catch one of the top wrestlers in the entire country as Oklahoma State-bound Balmeceda concludes his high school career at Silver Spurs Arena. The rest of the battles in the weight class should be thrilling as the rest of the podium could look a variety of ways.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: George Llanes, Coral Park (top half); Tanner Hill, Fleming Island (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Hill v. Davidson. Path to a medal might be easier for the loser of that match; that doesn't happen often.\nThe buzz: Balmeceda wraps a six-year states career this weekend, and while he'll get tough competition from the quarters forward, I expect he'll come out on top once again and take his fourth title. At the same time, sophomores Lukens and Eaddy are making this stretch run a prep run for the top spot/spots in 2020. One of the most loaded brackets of the entire group.\nThe buzz: Should be back-to-back titles for South Dade but one of the matches I’m intrigued by here is the first round match between Perkins and SW Miami’s Bryan Valdes, who gave the Hagerty junior one of his three losses this season.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Nico Esposito, Ft Lauderdale (top half); Elijah White, Edgewater (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Perkins v. Valdes. Could meet up again on Saturday.\nThe buzz: Like Balmeceda, Perry wraps up a long career this weekend, but one with no pushovers, exactly, either, as he could face four ranked wrestlers this weekend. I'll be curious to see if the Region 2 semi replays itself between Finken and Thompson, and if it does so in the same way that regions did. Region 2 is bringing a lot of pain into this bracket, with three wrestlers ranked in the top five.\nThe buzz: The top wrestlers in this weight class are both on the top half of this bracket so expect some fireworks in Saturday's semifinal round. If the SW Miami junior wins that one and faces Bencid in the final, he’ll need to beat him for the fifth time in six weeks to win a state title. The rest of this weight class is full of podium worthy wrestlers and expect some explosive battles in the quarterfinals and placing matches.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Kohl Drake, Newsome (top half); Armando Acosta, Buchholz (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Bencid v. Acosta. Not saying winner automatically makes the final, but...winner has a real shot at making final.\nThe buzz: This is going to be a very entertaining bracket, I think most so in the quarters Friday and top-half semi on Saturday. Just murderous matches everywhere. There will be at least one top-seven kid that does not get to Saturday. We should see a 1-2 semi; in the bottom half, you want no part of the consi side, particularly once two of the top-five ranked kids in the state come down to pay a visit in consi round 2 and the blood round. Just keep winning, as the movie might say.\nThe buzz: The last of the 3A “sure things”, Burburija will look to finish his senior year with another state title and an unbeaten record. D’ascoli, a state qualifier in 2017, has put together a stellar season after missing last year to injury and Nix gets the unenviable task of coming into this tournament ranked No. 2 in the state and ending up in Burburija’s bracket.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Christopher Telusma, Jacksonville Lee (top half); Noah Lusk, St Thomas Aquinas (bottom half).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Bobby Williams v. Anthony Williams. Could be two medalists in round 1.\nThe buzz: Of the state's best in the weight class, the two best might be meeting in the semis on Saturday morning with Burburija and Nix. Both have pretty clear paths to face each other, and the loser of that semi would have a pretty clear path to third place. Meanwhile, there's three pretty solid bottom-half kids who all have a good shot at a run to the title match, and all three should medal in some form or another.\nThe buzz: I could pick this bracket a number of different ways and each one would have holes in it. I’ve decided to go with recency bias on it, but if a few wrestlers get back on track this week, it will provide chaos to my picks.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Taso Kourtakis, Southridge (top half); Dylan Ruiz (Osceola).\nFirst-round match you can't miss: Dossey v. Lascano. Two top-four ranked kids, both with lots of motivation after last week.\nThe buzz: Oh, Region 2. You must have been a crazy place in this bracket last week, with Howe falling in the quarters and Dossey falling in the final. Thing about a surprise run in a prior-level tournament is, it's not a surprise to anyone anymore. Of course, Onalaja could repeat the feat again this week and shock the world again. I'd really watch out for Canedo, too; he knows how to get to Saturday night, having done it before.\nThe buzz: Former Lake Highland Prep wrestler Ruff hasn’t missed a beat this season, going 36-1 with his only loss coming at district duals to Lake Mary’s Moxley (who Ruff has beaten three times this season). He will be tested if he's going to win his first state title, with Kentucky-bound (for football) Pope potentially waiting in the semifinals with his unbeaten record. The bottom half of this bracket is the place to watch the quarterfinals where the potential matches would be No. 3 vs. No. 4 and No. 5 vs. No. 6 in the state.\nWrestlers that could prove me wrong: Maxwell Diaz, Coral Park (top half); Willie Lampkin, Lakeland (bottom half).\nFirst-round match: Pope v. Saint John. Could have a rematch of this one in the consi semis, the way I see it playing out.\nThe buzz: Region 1 heavies were going to play a big role in this weekend. Perhaps an even-bigger one if the Hollenbach/Sanchez projected semifinal, which I have going to Sanchez, goes the other way. Might feel a bit differently once the Friday night quarterfinal results are in. Ruff v. Pope also has the potential to be a decent top-half semi."

        "text": "US President: \"We've stopped Gaddafi's deadly advance\"; NATO to assume full responsibility for Libya operations.\nWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama told Americans on Monday the United States would work with its allies to hasten the day when Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi leaves power, but would not use force to topple him.\nIn a nationally televised address, Obama -- accused by many lawmakers of failing to explain the US role in the Western air campaign against Gaddafi's loyalists -- made the case for his decision to intervene militarily in the Libya conflict.\nHe cited the US role as guardians of global security saying, \"for generations, the United States of America has played a unique role as an anchor of global security and advocate for human freedom.\"\n\"Mindful of the risks and costs of military action, we are naturally reluctant to use force to solve the world's many challenges. But when our interests and values are at stake, we have a responsibility to act. That is what happened in Libya over the course of these last six weeks.\"\nBut he also underscored the limits of US military action as he sought to counter criticism that he lacked clear objectives and a credible exit strategy in the conflict.\n\"I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi's deadly advance,\" Obama told military officers at the National Defense University in Washington, 10 days after ordering US participation in Western-led air strikes.\n\"We will deny the regime arms, cut off its supply of cash, assist the opposition, and work with other nations to hasten the day when Gaddafi leaves power,\" Obama said.\nBut he added that \"it may not happen overnight\" and acknowledged that Gaddafi may be able to cling to power. \"Broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake,\" he said.\nObama spoke on the eve of a 35-nation conference in London to tackle the crisis in the North African oil-exporting country and weigh political options for ending Gaddafi's 41-year rule.\nObama's challenge was to define the limited purpose and scope of the US mission in Libya for Americans preoccupied with domestic economic concerns and weary of costly wars in two other Muslim countries, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBut his words may not be enough to mollify Republican opponents who say he has failed to lead in recent global crises ranging from Middle East unrest to Japan's nuclear emergency.\nObama's prime-time speech came a day after NATO agreed to assume full responsibility for military operations in Libya, ending uncertainty about who would take over the lead from US forces. \"The US will play a supporting role for the coalition,\" he stated.\nHe said the handover would take place on Wednesday.\nThe alliance's decision gave a boost to Obama's effort to show Americans he was making good on his commitment to limit the US military's involvement in Libya. NATO will take charge of air strikes that have targeted Gaddafi's military infrastructure as well as a no-fly zone and an arms embargo.\nThe White House also hopes Obama can score political points at home from gains on the battlefield by Libyan rebels emboldened by the Western air assault on Gaddafi's loyalists."

        "text": "Every Single Ocean Has A Massive Swirling Plastic Garbage Vortex Now!\nFor most of the world, the disposal of our trash is of high importance. We don’t want to have huge stinking trash heaps of coagulated waste stinking to high heaven near our homes, work, or places of entertainment. That is why we are trying to limit pollution across the map such as reducing carbon omissions, reusing items as life hacks, and recycling whenever we can.\nDespite our good intentions, we are not perfect beings and there will be times when the easiest option for waste is just to throw it away. Also, the world doesn’t seem to share our sympathetic views of keeping our planet clean, especially when it comes to plastic. In fact, most of our trash is thrown away into one place: the ocean. As a result, every ocean now has a giant swirling vortex of plastic garbage.\nAccording to an article by Vox, a single conservative estimate suggests that at least 1 million tons of plastic has entered the ocean since the 1970s. Taking our knowledge of underwater currents, scientists were able to find the swirling vortexes of plastic. Each vortex is also calculated to have thousands of tons of plastic in the underwater current cyclone. Here is the kicker: We reported that at least 1 million tons of plastic has entered the ocean, so where did the rest go? The vortexes only account for less than 1 percent of the plastic in estimation. Therefore, nobody really knows where the other 99 percent went. One weird possibility is that the fish are eating the plastic and it is entering the food chain.\nNevertheless, the garbage in our waters has increased in such high amounts that we now have something known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It is a patch of trash the size of Texas that’s accumulated in a swirling subtropical underwater whirlpool. It is also the most frequently studied and the most commonly known.\nNow reports are coming in from the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences that there are five of these swirling vortexes in the ocean. These findings are the work of Andres Cózar of the Universidad de Cadiz, along with information from the results of a 2010 circumnavigation cruise. To the human eye, or even from space, these garbage patches are invisible. Most of the plastic is bobbing just beneath the surface and most of the particles are smaller than one centimeter in diameter. Over time, plastic breaks down into smaller pieces, which is plausible in an ocean with currents, waves, and degradation from the sun.\nRight now, the scientists behind the findings are figuring out where the 99 percent of mixing plastic is. They have ideas, such as washing back on shore, or plastic being broken down even smaller than a centimeter in diameter, but right now, it is all theory."

Brown, in a news release.\nTheir attorneys could not be reached for comment and arraignment information was not available.\nNYPD officials said three suspects entered Hollis Hall on Utopia Parkway just before 2 p.m. and engaged in an argument with several students before one of the suspects fired a shot. No one was injured, but at least one of the suspects rummaged through the students’ belongings before they fled, authorities said.\nBrown said a police officer saw the defendants walking on 167th Street and the Grand Central Parkway shortly after the robbery and that Sutton dropped a backpack and Godbolt dropped a jar when he approached them.\nPolice found “duct tape, rope, scissors and a loaded.38 caliber Smith and Wesson black revolver with three live rounds of ammunition and a shell casing in the chamber from the backpack; 150 Alprazolam (Xanax) pills from the jar; and a.38 caliber round of ammunition from the dorm room,” Brown said."

Terry has been charged with racially abusing Ferdinand during the game and will appear in court on February 1. He has denied the charge.\nHowever the two clubs have now moved to show a united front. Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea, and Tony Fernandes, his QPR counterpart, said in the statement: \"We have discussed the issues surrounding this weekend's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Loftus Road and we are both in total agreement that abuse and discrimination has no place in football or society.\"\nThe statement continued: \"Both clubs enjoy fantastic support. However, we would remind fans that while we want to hear their passion, it's a fact that hatred and abuse is not what being a fan of Chelsea or QPR is about.\n\"The clubs will work together with the police to ensure that anyone using discriminatory or inflammatory language is identified and that the strongest possible action is taken against them.\n\"A local derby is always a special occasion and this weekend's FA Cup tie is a unique opportunity to show the world that hatred has no place in our game, our clubs, or our communities.\n\"We would urge fans witnessing any form of abuse to report it to a matchday steward or text confidentially on 07557 435421.\n\"Let's make Saturday's match a celebration of football.\"\nThe match has been brought forward to a midday kick-off on the advice of police in a bid to minimise potential crowd problems, with both clubs keen to avoid any ill-feeling amongst fans."

        "text": "A false alert of an impending missile attack highlights just how unprepared the country is for nuclear disaster.\nWhy would my 22-year-old brother be calling so early on a Saturday morning? I’d ignored the first call. But the second time the phone rang, I picked it up. He was panicking, his voice trembling uncharacteristically: He’d just received the emergency alert warning of a ballistic missile that was heading for Hawaii, where I’m from, and where he and my family still live. “THIS IS NOT A DRILL,” the alert read. My brother was alone, and had no idea what to do or where to go. And he wouldn’t have had much time to figure out a game plan—some estimates suggest a missile from North Korea could reach Hawaii in 20 minutes.\nPeople across the state were terrified. Many assumed they would die, but sought shelter anyway. They took cover in mall bathrooms, bathtubs, drug stores—even a storm drain. Hawaii has very few shelters, and houses with basements are rare. There were reports of people speeding down highways and running red lights to reunite with family members. Others called one another to say “I love you” one last time.\nThe alert turned out to be false, an epic—almost unbelievable—mishap. A state employee had accidentally triggered the Emergency Alert System message at 8:07 a.m., during what should have been a routine internal test. It took officials 38 minutes to announce their mistake, and to confirm that the warning had been a false alarm. Those 38 minutes were the 38 worst minutes of many Hawaii residents’ lives. And they were just as horrifying for people outside of Hawaii who, like me, felt helpless as they contended with the prospect of never seeing their loved ones again.\nThe threat against Hawaii predates Trump: In 2009, then-President Obama warned that North Korea was capable of bombing Hawaii, and the military responded by strengthening preparations in the state. And while many locals may, at least in the past, have tended to express a certain nonchalance about the North Korea threat, Hawaii at its core knows better than to shrug off the prospect of such an attack: Just over 76 years ago, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor killed more than 2,400 Americans, including civilians, and wounded more than 1,100 others. “We have a culture of preparedness in Hawaii,” said LoPresti, who spearheaded an effort last year to update the state’s disaster plans to deal with a worst-case scenario.\nYet the Saturday fiasco, and the explosion of emotion that ensued, revealed that a culture of preparedness will only go so far in protecting the Aloha State from the ravages of nuclear war. It was also a raw reminder of Hawaii’s geopolitical role in the United States—a role that, for many in the kingdom-turned-territory-turned-state, is a source of deep resentment.\nNoelani Goodyear-Kaʻōpua was in the parking lot of Long’s Drugs near downtown Honolulu when she and her husband turned on their car and heard the emergency alert on the radio.\nGoodyear-Kaʻōpua’s comments became more pointed as she reflected on the moment, blaming Trump for what seems like a starker-than-ever threat of nuclear war. But, she added, it’s just the latest chapter in what she described as a long history of oppression in Hawaii. “There are so many ways in which we’re targeted every day—not just by missiles but also the way our language is targeted, our history is targeted, our people who can’t afford to live in our homeland are targeted,” she said. “On top of that we have a layer of intense militarization that impacts our lands and waters every day and also makes us a target for the kind of aggression that we have provoked.” Next week, she noted, will be the 125th anniversary of the arguably illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom.\nOthers view the mainland U.S.’s relationship with Hawaii as more symbiotic than it is exploitative. Tourism, a majority of it supplied by other parts of the country, is the single largest contributor to the state’s GDP—and on Saturday, Hawaii officials were forced to reckon with exactly how much they rely on those visitors. Hotels and tourist spots were especially chaotic after the alert was sent out. My 19-year-old cousin, who happened to be visiting Hawaii from San Francisco, described a scene of pandemonium at her Waikiki hotel. Hotel officials told everyone to stay inside, she explained, so for those 38 minutes (and beyond) the lobby was packed with agitated, distraught guests. Some people were so unnerved that the hotel manager gave them access to the hotel’s basement so they could calm down.\nPaola Rodelas, the spokeswoman for Unite Here Local 5, a union for hotel workers, said her conversations with employees from several different hotels made it clear that no hotel had a plan for the situation. Cooks and housekeepers told Rodelas that some guests were panicked and crying; a manager told kitchen staff at one hotel about the alert and told them they should call their loved ones. “It just kind of seems, overall, that no one knew how to react,” Rodelas said, acknowledging that the disarray extended far beyond hotels. Nobody anywhere, she concluded, had any idea what to do.\nAfter all, unlike a tsunami or hurricane, which Hawaii residents are used to preparing for (often very earnestly), the threat of a fast-arriving missile is a total unknown.\nStill, Chad Blair, the politics and opinions editor at Honolulu Civil Beat, told me it could have the opposite effect, more like the boy who cried wolf—some people might not take seriously the next this-is-not-a-drill alert. He also warned against exaggerating Hawaii’s vulnerability to such a threat. North Korea has lots of targets to choose from—the latest news reports suggest North Korea now has the ability to attack Los Angeles, and even Chicago and New York City.\nThe probability of a bomb aside, some Hawaii residents said the event was different kind of wake-up call. The alert gave many a new appreciation for their loved ones and for the islands’ simple pleasures: the white-sand beaches, the gentle trade winds, the January sunshine. It also brought people together in a way that they hadn’t before—even in a place where the “aloha spirit” is such a fact of life it’s codified in state laws."

The school not only helps children prepare for the Sacraments, but also assists the Polish chaplain in arranging Mass for the children, which includes a children’s choir. The group also prepares the Sunday issue of the parish newsletter.\nThe Polish School received support at its beginning from Fr Keith Herrera, who allowed the church to be used for classes. As demand grew and numbers leapt from 30 to more than 130 children, the school moved to St Mary’s Cathedral, where it stayed for a year with 150 pupils. It then moved to Aberdeen Grammar School where it still runs classes, with some split to Harlaw Academy, as 300 pupils attend each week.\nToday, more than 70 staff serve over 500 Polish people at the school, the biggest Polish Saturday school in Scotland.\nAs well as catechesis and Polish language and culture classes, there is a show for Independence Day, a Nativity play, St Nicolas Day celebrations, a Constitution Day show, an end of year ball, an All Saints ball, reading competitions and exhibitions.\nThe school hosts charity events, an SFA-registered football club, courses for parents, adult language classes, speech therapy, a choir, a theatre class, and talks from historians, artists and musicians.\nWhat are the Christian democrats proposing for Scotland?"

Al Sharpton plan to announce an ambitious advocacy agenda Wednesday aimed at flexing their political muscle in advance of the 2016 presidential campaign.\ncontrolled Senate to confirm attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch, whose nomination process progressed and then stalled after President Obama put her name forward more than 140 days ago.\nlevel religious objections bills, seen as discriminatory against gays and lesbians, and pressing Congress to advance reforms of the criminal justice system.\n“We are already in the season of people announcing their run for president. We can’t wait until 2016 to set the agenda. We need to set that now,” Sharpton said Monday while visiting Washington, where he was attending meetings at the White House and with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.\nThe agenda will be formalized this week at the annual convention of the National Action Network, Sharpton’s civil rights group. The meeting is the first public convening of the nation’s top civil rights leaders since a spate of police violence sparked unrest in cities across the nation, starting with the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., last August.\nSharpton said that he plans personally to petition Senate Republicans to hold a floor vote on Lynch’s nomination. He also plans trips to three states where religious objections laws have either been passed or are being considered.\nOnce a skeptic of the gay rights movement, Sharpton has in recent years emerged as one of its most vocal black supporters. These days, he argues that gay rights should be considered a civil rights matter. He said bringing gay and lesbian groups into the civil rights fold is crucial to bolstering the political power of those working on civil justice issues.\nSuch issues — gay rights and reforms in policing, criminal justice and prisons — have dominated the national discussion in recent months, opening the door for civil rights groups to claim a higher profile during the presidential campaign, some civil rights leaders say.\nThis week’s conference will help advance that cause, they say, and help focus efforts to define the issues to be highlighted in 2016.\nCampbell is one of several leaders of civil rights organizations — including the heads of the NAACP and the Urban League — who plan to participate in a panel intended to chart a course, and to funnel energy from national protests in favor of policing and criminal justice reforms toward political action and achieving tangible results.\n“We need to be working collaboratively around how we apply elevated pressure on the candidates to talk about these issues,” Campbell said.\nSharpton has been a persistent and insistent voice on behalf of reforms in policing and the criminal justice system, and this week’s convention marks the latest shift in the evolution of his tactics. Although he is a lightning rod despised by many police groups, especially the New York Police Department, Sharpton is vowing to take a more considerate line.\nAt this week’s convention, at least three potential 2016 presidential candidates, all dark horses, will speak: Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.); former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley (D); and Maryland’s Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and so far the only black person known to be considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination.\nA decade ago, it would not have been surprising for Sharpton himself to consider a presidential run. In 2004, he mounted a short-lived campaign for the Democratic nomination. He laughed off the notion that he might pursue a similar strategy in 2016."

The low-lying southern parts of the state are fringed with swamps, including the massive Okefenokee. The terrain gently rises to the north and west, and the state’s principal city, Atlanta, sits just to the south of the Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountains. These mountains rise to over 4,000 feet, drawing hikers, climbers and other outdoor enthusiasts. Georgia’s relatively significant size and diverse topography mean that the climate varies in different parts of the state.\nGeorgia falls into the same climate classification category, humid subtropical, as most of the southeastern United States. This climate type features mild winters, comfortable spring and autumn temperatures, but long, hot and steamy summers. As its name implies, high humidity characterizes the humid subtropical climate type, which makes temperatures feel even warmer. Precipitation amounts vary annually but tend to be substantial, ranging from an average of 50 inches in the southern lowlands to 75 inches in the mountains. The northern mountains, particularly the higher elevations, experience the coldest average temperatures in the state, while the far south has the overall highest temperatures.\nMost of Georgia becomes sweltering in the summertime, as tropical air streams into the state unabated. The high temperature in the hottest months of the year, July and August, average in the low 90s Fahrenheit in the south and coastal areas, the upper 80s to near 90 in the Atlanta vicinity and the mid to upper 80s in the mountains. Overnight lows average in the low 70s in the south and on the coast, near 70 in Atlanta, and the 60s in the mountains. Occasional thunderstorms provide the bulk of summer rainfall, except for precipitation from tropical storms and hurricanes in late summer. Such systems occasionally directly strike Georgia’s Atlantic coast, but more often their remnants track into the state from Alabama, Florida and South Carolina.\nWinters are mild throughout the state, although temperatures exhibit considerable geographic variation. In January and February, daily highs in the south and along the southeast coast average in the low to mid-60s, highs around Atlanta average in the mid-50s, and highs in the mountains top out only around 50. Overnight lows hover near 40 in the south and on the coast, the low to mid-30s around Atlanta and the upper 20s in the mountains. Flurries and light snow usually fall in northern Georgia a few times per year, but the chance of seeing snow decreases further south. Measurable snowfall or ice accumulations are rare but are far more likely in the mountains than elsewhere in the state.\nMarch and April feature pleasant temperatures, with highs in the 70s and 80s to the south and 60s and 70s to the north, it is a great time to see the new flowers. Temperatures begin to creep up in May, with highs averaging in the low 80s throughout much of the state. Severe thunderstorms can occur in spring, occasionally producing hail and sometimes even spawning tornadoes. April is usually the rainiest month of the year.\nMost of the state is still hot in September, with highs in the mid-80s. But temperatures drop rapidly, with highs averaging in the 70s in October and the 60s in November when it is great to see the fall foliage. And in the fall, as in late summer, tropical storms and hurricanes can impact the state.\nHarris, Amy. \"Climate in Georgia.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/climate-georgia-55775.html. 06 March 2018."

He was not alone in this. I remember when Gerald Ford, before he succeeded Spiro Agnew as Nixon's vice president, said (regarding some of the spirited criticism of the Nixon Vietnam policy): \"You don't go out and tackle your quarterback once he has called the play.\" I thought at the time that if your quarterback appeared demented and was running in the wrong direction, tackling him mightn't be a bad idea.\nI think a great many American men find football talk irresistible as a demonstration of two-fisted he-manship, and I suspect that that is one reason Vice President George Bush, a couple of days after his first debate with Michael Dukakis, gave a speech in which he used a plethora of football images. He had the Democrats \"punting on first down,\" and he said that the Republican team now had the ball and was going to march, march on down the field, and I thought that at any minute he might break into a chorus of \"Boola-Boola\" and \"Bulldog! Bulldog! Bow! Wow! Wow!\" As a way of shaking off a wimp image, football lingo probably seems very tempting.\nI feel uneasy when powerful public figures shift into the gridiron mode in discussing the life-and-death affairs that affect all of us on this precious, precarious planet. There are just enough similarities between football and war to lure us into confusing the two. Football even has The Bomb.\nFor those who are too inactive or, like millions of wives, too intellectual to watch football on the tube, where we athletes learn the language, The Bomb is a long forward pass. Our pass receiver scampers through the defensive backfield and makes a dash for the enemy goal line. Our quarterback unleashes The Bomb, a forward pass of perhaps 65 yards that lands on the sticky fingers of the receiver. Our receiver then carries The Bomb jubilantly into the end zone for a touchdown. As bombs go, it's not bad. The only explosion it causes is the roar of the fans, and it's quite harmless to the public.\nIn another section of Cooke's work, he attempts to enlighten his countrymen on the mysteries of American football. He says, \".... No American institution is worse understood abroad than American football. British sportsmen.... succumb without a second thought to the facetious view of American football as a mindless bout of mayhem between brutes got up in spacemen outfits..... American football is an open-air chess game disguised as warfare. It is without question the most scientific of all outdoor games.\"\nThis, of course, was written years before our football teams went over to capture the hearts and minds of the British.\nI hope that, whoever our next President may be, he will stay away from the football metaphor. The trouble isn't so much that it is inept as that it tends to blur the borders between sport, whose impact is fleeting, and the real world, whose impact can be permanent and maybe terminal. When you start thinking of the real world in terms of quarterbacks, punting, first downs and marching on down the field, it is difficult not to think also in terms of half-times, closing minutes and final guns.\nAnd when you start thinking of such unreal particulars as the final seconds of the closing minutes, and you decide that it's time to use the bomb, and when it is truly in your power to use The Bomb, the final guns could be not just the final guns, but the honest-to-God beginning of the no-kidding final guns--and that is very frightening."

The Big Apple is a hotbed of activity all week long, but many traditional tourist attractions are closed on Sunday nights, including most of the top museums. Fortunately, armed with some good tips, families can find something to do anytime of the week, even on a Sunday night.\nThe bright lights of Times Square are always fun at night. Several famous toy, gift and fashion stores provide entertainment for kids of all ages, and adults will appreciate the grand scale of the ADHD-proof television screens and lighting. The area, which is centered at the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, has an overwhelming number of family restaurants ranging from well-known chains to independent eateries. Certainly better places to eat abound in the city, but sometimes it's easier for family members to agree on a restaurant chain everyone already knows.\nThe world’s most famous city park is particularly busy on the weekend, but it provides a relaxing escape from the street crowds and pushy taxi drivers. Most people stay in the southern half of the park, which features the Wollman ice skating rink, the Heckscher Playground and the John Lennon “Strawberry Fields” memorial. Another highlight is the 106-acre Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, located just north of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the summer, most of the parks in New York host free concerts on different nights, many of which feature well-known acts. Children will enjoy the Central Park Zoo and carousel, but Conde Nast Traveler suggests not taking one of the cliché, overpriced carriage rides popularized by scenes from Woody Allen’s “Manhattan.” The park closes at 1 a.m., but tourists should stay in the main areas after nightfall.\nSunday is a big day for stage productions as the theaters often host both afternoon matinees and nighttime performances. More progressive plays and musicals may be found off-Broadway, but the giant Broadway productions are most likely to entertain the entire family. At time of publication, long-running classics included “Wicked,” and “The Lion King” but you could consider an edgier production like \"Chicago\" or \"Hamilton\" if the children are all in their teens.

Transportation choices and burning fossil fuels for heat and electricity are two major contributors to your carbon footprint. Simple strategies can help you immediately reduce your footprint in these areas. In addition to these instructions, follow the principles of reducing, reusing and recycling and consider how your diet and the products you buy contribute to greenhouse gases. For a comprehensive look at your carbon footprint, take an online quiz like the ones offered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the Global Footprint Network.\nInstall a programmable thermostat and lower or raise the temperature by 10 to 15 degrees F whenever you are gone for the day. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, regularly setting back your thermostat for eight-hour stretches will result in energy savings of up to 10 percent annually. (See References 3) Adjust the thermostat even when you're at home --- according to the California Energy Commission, setting the thermostat higher in warm weather will save you 1 to 3 percent for every degree above 72 degrees F (see References 4).\nGet a home-energy audit to fully assess the ways in which you can make your house more energy-efficient.

        "text": "Settling the bill can be awkward, especially when you’re out on a first date, with friends or even distant family. Apps like Foodivide and Splitwise can help do the math on splitting the check if you want to pay the precise amount of what you owe at the table.\nBut forget never having cash — half of respondents to a 2017 US Bank survey of more than 2,000 participants said they carry cash less than half the time while they’re out. Who is actually supposed to pay after you’ve swiped right or are out to dinner with family?\nStill, figuring out the politics of who pays can be tricky in the moment. Here’s how to navigate the dreaded bill in any scenario.\nWhen you’re going out with family, whoever does the inviting typically foots the bill. So if Dad, Mom, an aunt, uncle or cousin does the asking, expect them to pay — but it’s always worth offering to kick in a few bucks, especially if you can afford to, etiquette experts note.\nIf you’re out with siblings, don’t expect the person who makes the most to foot the bill every time. It’s okay to let a sis or bro pick up the check now and then, Thomas said, but be prepared to reciprocate the gesture, or simply split the tab each time to avoid an argument.\nAlways expect to go Dutch when grabbing drinks or dinner with friends, Thomas said.\nIt’s always easiest to split the bill among everyone who joins instead of splitting hairs over the cost of separate menu items, especially if it’s a big group, Thomas added. Another way to avoid the hassle is to have one person foot the bill and use Venmo to pay back the friend exactly what you owe — that way if you get something small, you don’t get stuck paying more than you should.\n“Let’s say I grab the check, knowing full well you’ll Venmo me the funds — that’s absolutely fine,” Thomas said.\nWhoever does the asking should presumably be the one to pay the bill on a first date, Thomas insists. But if you feel strongly about going Dutch, that’s perfectly fine too.\nIf your boss is asking you to a lunch meeting to talk about work, expect that he or she is going to pick up the tab. “If work is actually being done, the implication is that the boss will pay. In most cases, there is an expense account. If you’re unsure, you can always offer when the bill comes,” Thomas said.\nOn the reverse end, if you’re asking to meet with your boss outside of work hours to get career advice, then you should be the one to treat, Thomas said.\nIf your boss insists on paying the bill, however, it’s fine to stand down. The offer shows that you appreciate his or her time."

It opened up a huge debate about consent and what it looks like.\nWe realised that consent has a lot of grey areas and wanted to start a conversation about the spaces in between the black and white of consent; it’s not as straightforward as no means no.\nHow was the idea put into action?\nWe put a Facebook post out asking women to share occasions when they had tried to say stop or slow down a sexual encounter without using the words.\nWe received hundreds of statements from women from around the world.\nWe then took 50 of those statements and created T-shirts which were made available for sale on an e-commerce site. And we asked 50 influencers to wear and post a pic on International Women’s Day.\nOur aim was to start a conversation about consent, and in particular, enthusiastic consent.\nThe response has been incredible.\nNot only have we started a conversation about consent, but we have had contact with other countries and organisations wanting to replicate the idea in their own region.\nWe’re also in conversations with universities and various festivals and support groups about consent education and how to change the conversation.\nUltimately we would love to see legislation changed as to what constitutes consent.\nThe Saxon Mullins case in NSW highlights the need for this clear understanding of what consent is. It’s not just hearing someone say ‘No’. There are many ways we communicate, and this campaign is about those subtleties of that communication.\nWhat has been the benefit of using such a diverse group of women to demonstrate the issue?\nWe’ve reached a very broad audience.\nThis issue about enthusiastic consent affects everyone; men and women. Women want to be heard and men have been very open to being educated and enlightened as to how we communicate. It’s been educational for everyone.\nHow have you used social media to generate attention?\nThe entire campaign was driven by social media.\nWe’ve used Instagram and Facebook to drive the entire campaign. Recruiting influencers, and having everyone tag and share.\nWhat have been the ripple effects?\nProbably the biggest one is the cathartic and healing effect it seems to have had on people who have experienced sexual assault. Buying and wearing a t-shirt has helped them to heal their own personal experiences, and to communicate both online, and offline, with those around them.\nAnd the realisation that it is more than one day, International Women’s Day. The campaign has a life of its own now and education and working with universities and schools is now our focus for stage 2.\nAs well as the global reach.\nWhat do you make of the Cannes nom?\nTo be the only Australian work shortlisted for a Glass Lion is amazing. Especially when we look at the company we’re in.\nWe’re a small group of individuals from Melbourne who set out to create a campaign that would start a conversation. We’re in the company of Nike, Coca-Cola, Dove, global agency groups. It’s pretty humbling.\nHow can an event like Cannes help generate attention to this issue?\nThe platform and audience in Cannes is huge, and I intend to use the 20 minutes I have in front of the Jury and delegates, to further callout for support, conversation, and awareness.\nThis is about a conversation and we’re already in discussions with other countries about running their own campaigns. Cannes is a great platform to drive further conversation.\nWe’re in the business of communication and I have a week to communicate with a huge melting pot of people from advertising throughout the world.\nIn an industry driven by consumption, to be able to use creativity to affect change is so rewarding.\nHow intertwined is this issue and the advertising industry in Australia and worldwide?\nI wouldn’t say the consent conversation is exclusive to any particular industry.\nIt’s about education and how we raise and condition boys and girls. How we represent relationships in the media and conditioning of both sexes from birth.\nThat’s something well outside of any workplace or industry.\nWhat is still the biggest hurdle for 50 Shades, and the industry more generally?\nI think our industry is making great strides in recognising talent of all genders and minorities.\nI know there are the naysayers about quotas and this whole female push, but it will only be temporary until there is a balance and this ingrained unconscious bias starts dissolving away.\nEveryone needs to be recognised for their talents, regardless of gender.\nFor so long, women’s gender was clouding any recognition they may have received. Now that is slowly falling away, which is progress.\nWe started 50 Shades of No in response to the International Women’s Day #pressforprogress, and I think we’re slowly getting somewhere."

When the conductors are pushed together by falling trees or limbs, electrical sparks drop into the vegetation below. During the wildfire season when the vegetation is dry, these electrical sparks pose an extreme danger of igniting a wildfire,\" he added.\nWildfires have damaged thousands of homes and killed dozens of people in the state over the past several years, including the massive Camp Fire that was contained by officials late last year after damaging 14,000 homes and killing 86 people.\nPacific Gas and Electric told NBC in a statement that it was reviewing the judge's ruling and was committed to following \"all rules and regulations that apply to our work.\"\n\"PG&E’s most important responsibility is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve.

        "text": "Madison — The speed limit on some Wisconsin highways would rise to 70 mph, under a proposal approved by the state Senate on a voice vote Wednesday.\nThe bill would end Wisconsin's status as a lone island of 65 mph limits in the Midwest by increasing the maximum speed on stretches of interstates and some other four-lane highways that have overpasses, underpasses and ramps instead of other roads that directly cross traffic on the highway.\nThe proposal now returns to the Assembly, which passed a different version on a bipartisan vote in March.\nThe bill would mean that stretches of all interstates in Wisconsin could be marked up to 70 mph by Gov. Scott Walker's administration, as could stretches of state Highways 51, 53 and 151.\nThe proposal's lead sponsor in the Senate, Republican Devin LeMahieu of Oostburg, called it \"common sense legislation\" that left a final decision on the speed limits up to state transportation officials.\n\"This legislation authorizes, but does not require, the Department of Transportation to raise the speed limit on interstates and freeways where it is safe to do so,\" LeMahieu said.\nAll of Wisconsin's neighbors have maximum speed limits of 70 mph or higher, and Wisconsin is the only state between Pennsylvania and Oregon that doesn't have a maximum speed limit of at least 70 mph.\nSo far, Walker hasn't said whether he would sign the bill and the state DOT has not said how much time it would take to determine which highway stretches could rise to 70 mph and then change their signs accordingly. Spokeswomen for Walker and the DOT had no further comment on the Senate action beyond saying that their offices are monitoring the legislation.\nUntil now, opponents have blocked the proposal's passage in Wisconsin by arguing that there would be inevitable safety effects from allowing the higher speeds. But a compromise among GOP lawmakers cleared the way for the proposal to move forward by ensuring that highways with at-grade crossings for intersecting roads or even driveways couldn't be cleared for 70 mph speeds.\nAAA Wisconsin has argued that the speed limit should not be changed in Wisconsin, particularly for heavy trucks, because an increase of 5 mph could lengthen the stopping distance for those vehicles by as much as 100 feet, or 20%. The motorists group cites federal data showing that large trucks were involved in 7.4% of fatal crashes in Wisconsin in 2012, while Minnesota and Iowa — which allow trucks to travel 70 mph on rural highways — had rates of 10% and 13.2%, respectively.\nDemocrats such as Rep. Dan Riemer of Milwaukee have said that they won't vote for the bill until they see strong evidence that it won't make the state's roads more dangerous, arguing that the proposal's supporters owe that to the public.\n■Broaden existing state law to make it a felony to physically harm or threaten to harm a current or former law enforcement officer, prosecutor or judge because of an official action taken by those authorities or their colleagues. The proposal goes to the Assembly.\n■Allow search warrants to be issued so that blood can be drawn for testing from a driver who is suspected of a first-time intoxicated driving offense. Under U.S. Supreme Court rulings, a failure to get a search warrant for a blood draw could affect a criminal case if the driver didn't agree to the test first.\nBut in Wisconsin, it's not possible currently to get a search warrant in first-time drunken driving cases. That's because search warrants are issued only in criminal investigations and Wisconsin is the only state in the nation in which first offense drunken driving on its own is a municipal violation, similar to a speeding ticket, and not a crime.\nIn approving the measure on a voice vote, the Senate sent it to the Assembly.\n■Make it a crime for a person to falsely claim that he or she received military honors in the absence of such awards. The Assembly will take the proposal up next.\n■Make it a misdemeanor to put a global positioning device on people or their vehicle without their consent. There would be exemptions for law enforcement; parents and guardians using the devices to track their minor children; businesses that monitor where their vehicles go; and lien holders who use the devices to find vehicles for repossession.\nThe Senate passed the measure on a voice vote Wednesday. The Assembly approved it in February."

Everything that happens in Augusta impacts everyone in Maine, from the taxes we pay to the education we provide for our children. In my first session I focused on workforce development, job creation and growing Maine’s economy. The Speaker of the House selected me as one of only two freshman legislators to serve on a special committee charged to find ways to support and grow our workforce and our economy. My background in small business and education enabled me to be a contributor to the bold and creative solutions that will help jump start our economy and help people gain the education and training they need to make a livable wage. One of the best parts of my job as a legislator has been to assist citizens and small business owners with their individual concerns. It has been a joy to see the positive results in a person’s life when I have been able to intervene on their behalf. The people in my district are important to me and I am honored to represent them in Augusta; I will continue to work hard and be their strong voice in Augusta.\nHealth care is a right not a privilege. That’s why I support life-saving health care for 70,000 Mainers, including nearly 3,000 veterans. No one should be bankrupt by mounting medical bills when they are sick. Our economy will also see a $1 million per day boost in economic activity, so it’s right morally and economically.\nWhat, if anything, would you change about welfare?I think the best anti-poverty program is a good job. Mainers deserve leaders who are going to work for economic opportunity for everyone. Though there is no data that Maine has widespread fraud in our welfare programs, fraud in any state program is unacceptable.\nBy how much?No one can live on the current minimum wage and raising it needs to be part of a comprehensive economic program aimed at making Maine's economy work for everyone.\nPlease explain your position on legalization?Maine law recognizes marijuana products for medical use because of their powerful properties to assist patients with serious medical conditions. If we recognize this substance as a medicine, I don’t believe we should also legalize its use for “recreation” any more than we do any other medicine."

        "text": "Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it.\nAmid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place.\nFew pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers.\nThe cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.\nAcross the county, another cemetery lies hidden along a gravel road on one of the steep hillsides above Afton. It also holds many of that city's pioneers. Among them are several Civil War veterans, including one known as \"the fighting reverend.\"\nLonely and forlorn, ravaged by vandals and threatened by encroaching buckthorn and other overgrowth from a nearby woods, it is a cemetery in a battle for its life.\nThough Atkinson Cemetery in Cottage Grove and Mount Hope Cemetery in Afton are of the same vintage, historic significance and background, their fates have taken decidedly contrasting turns.\nThe status of Minnesota's historic cemeteries is reflected in these two graveyards.\nThere are more than 4,000 cemeteries and farm burial grounds in Minnesota; many are abandoned or under threat of vandalism and neglect, their history forgotten. \"I would call it a significant problem,\" said Bonnie McDonald, executive director of the Minnesota Preservation Alliance.\nIn 2002, the alliance placed Mount Hope Cemetery on its Top 10 list of most endangered historic sites in the state. The cemetery had been abandoned, and Washington County was considering the site as a location for a new radio tower, McDonald said.\nSince then, the graveyard has been removed from the endangered list: the county placed its antenna elsewhere because the city's title to the cemetery land was unsettled.\nWhile that may be good news in the short term, McDonald said, Mount Hope still faces the same problems as other historic cemeteries across the state.\n\"Reinvesting or donating money to preserve cemeteries is a harder sell\" compared to buildings, McDonald said. \"It takes people.\"\nTwo people, E. Katie Holm and Ken Martens, have taken a special interest in two of Washington County's oldest graveyards, and their work insures that the cemeteries' history won't be lost.\nIt's not just dry dates and facts, but poignant stories of pioneer lives.\nHelped by a grant from the Independent Feature Project, Holm, a Minneapolis writer and photographer, spent about a year researching and documenting the history of Atkinson Cemetery and the lives of the city pioneers who lie there. For her efforts, she was named the city's preservationist of the year in 2005.\n\"My family has always had an interest in cemeteries and genealogy,\" Holm said. Specifically, she credits her grandmother for sparking her interest in the stories that cemeteries have to tell.\n\"Cemeteries show the history of each place -- where it started and where it's been,\" she said. \"They show how people care for their memories.\"\nThe cemetery, Holm found, was probably founded on heartache. John Atkinson had been one of Cottage Grove's first arrivals, in 1846. He founded the Universalist Church, set up a private school in his home and became an early city leader. When his 16-year-old son Martin drowned in 1854, he was likely buried on a parcel of land Atkinson owned. That site grew into the cemetery.\nIn the early 1970s, before the area around it was developed, Atkinson Cemetery had been abandoned for 60 years, so overgrown no one even noticed it was there, Holm said.\nOnce it was rediscovered, the city, joined by families and the city's Lions Club, began major restoration work. Most of the vegetation, save for a majestic oak tree, was removed. Grave markers were replaced, Holm said, but after years of vandalism and lost records, it's not certain that gravestones were put back in their original spots.\nThe effort was aided by Forrest Mars, head of the giant candy company whose family -- inventors of M&Ms and Milky Way and Snickers candy bars -- is from the Newport/Cottage Grove area. A large monument in the cemetery pays tribute to the Mars ancestors, though it's unknown if any are actually buried there.\n\"I would assume there's more people there than there are records for,\" Holm said. Notably, there is no gravestone for John Atkinson, but it's likely he's somewhere in the cemetery bearing his name. \"As far as I know, no one knows where he's buried.\"\nMartens, a local historian who is active in the Afton Historical Museum, first visited Mount Hope Cemetery with his father as a boy, in 1967. The pair hiked up the hillside on Halloween day. \"And we had to look for it, because there was no improvement here.\"\nAs with Atkinson Cemetery, the first burials at Mount Hope were in 1854, four years before Minnesota became a state.\nAmong the Civil War veterans buried here, Martens said, is the Rev. Simon Putnam, whose fiery ardor for the Union cause helped recruit dozens ofsoldiers. Many joined the First Minnesota Infantry, the unit credited with turning the tide at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\"I call him the fighting reverend,\" Martens said. Putnam, who founded the Congregational Church in Afton and whose house still stands across from the Afton Historical Society Museum, enlisted at age 39, bringing his 16-year-old son Myron along as a drummer boy.\nThe Putnams ended up with the Third Minnesota Volunteers. While fewer than 20 members of the unit died in battle, nearly 300 died of disease. That was the case for both Putnams.\nThe cemetery is actually two distinct areas, Martens said: A Victorian-era cemetery with more ornate stones and formal burial sites and, further into the woods, a primitive burial ground with cruder homemade stones and telltale depressions in the earth with no markings.\n\"It's been lost and forgotten a lot of times, and then rediscovered and lost again,\" Martens said. There are 33 burials in the newer portion, though archaeologists suspect there could be 100 more.\nVandals have made it a frequent target, and their damage is still evident. Buckthorn and other vegetation also are encroaching on the site, despite volunteers who occasionally mow it and Boy Scouts who do frequent cleanups, Martens said. \"Nature takes over faster than you can clean it up.\"\nMartens has spent much time over the past 40 years poring through records and piecing together the stories of the people buried at the cemetery. \"I feel like I'm a detective trapped in a time machine,\" he said.\nPartly through his work, there may be hope for Mount Hope Cemetery.\nThe city of Afton is in the process of getting a clear title to the land. Once that's done, the cemetery could get the regular care that it needs, said Ken Johnson, head of the city's Public Works Department.\nThat prospect tantalizes Martens. \"There's still mysteries to be solved here,\" he said. \"If we could preserve it, we could probably get to the answers someday.\""

I was always cold, writes Upala Sen.\nBest Friend left on an official trip for an “indefinite period”. Now he is the sort who starts feeling homesick the moment he steps out of south Delhi. So when he called to enquire about the weather “back home” (he had been away for two days) I decided to indulge him.\nThe hot dude was away, so the mercury had plummeted in grief — I thought he could do with some extra niceness. Response: Grunt. I dropped the cute act and then asked him matter-of-factly if he had reached home. What I meant was, had he left office? But no sooner were the words out of my mouth than he bit my head off. “This is not home. This is a house, just a guest house.” Ouch! What did I say?\nMercifully for my self-esteem bbsonline.org says that the words children use are words children hear, and not so much the words they prefer. Point to be noted.\nLikewise, I would get confused between home and house.\nAccording to mtannoyances.com (the full name is mother tongue annoyances) home is “anywhere you live -- your home may be a mobile home or an igloo” whereas, a house is “a physical structure with walls and a roof and a door”. I would think the difference goes deeper, where words lose their efficacy.\nThe other day we were at a photoshoot. The model was friendly and as she wielded those makeup brushes with Van Gogian élan we chatted. “I am from New York,” she told us. It sounded crisp and smart and…to the point,'Nu York' (as she put it) or for that matter New Delhi or Bombay. Take a peek into wordlab.com, it is full of exotic place names. And to think whenever I was asked where I was from I had to say Bandel. No, I have no problems owning up that I am a small-towner, but the name of my small town is undeniably a phonetic horror.\nSo sometimes I mentioned the nearest city, at other times the state, and for the really really insistent I took a lesson in map pointing before I gave out the name. Till one day, for a change, someone asked me what my home town was like. And that got me thinking. Let's see: birthday parties with oily chips and return gifts, a magnolia tree outside my room, a-rupee-a-ride cycle rickshaws, early morning squatters dotting the Hooghly… Bandel was interminable childhood, certainly not worth sacrificing at the altar of phonetics. Besides, as per msgboard.snopes.com there are people who live in places called Gayville and Bitsch.\nWe had shifted house five times when we were in Bandel. Come to think of it they were all homes.\nSome years back I was taking the Blueline from Tughlagabad to Dwarka, when a friend called. I had just moved to the city and was still feeling unsettled. And when she hung up abruptly with a “there’s someone at the door” it occurred to me that here I had no door of my own.\nI never mixed up those words again. And soon after I moved into a home.\nNow what did I say?"

        "text": "Q: Can raspberry cordial kill stomach bugs in contaminated water?\nA: Yes. Raspberry and blackcurrant cordials can kill bacteria that cause some stomach bugs.\nHave you ever used cordial to prevent gastro bugs? Have your say on the messageboard below.\nFor most of us, cordial is off the shopping list; we avoid it because it's full of sugar, bad for our teeth and some of its artificial colourings can make some kids hyperactive.\nBut raspberry cordial has some very loyal fans, who don't necessarily enjoy its sweet taste.\nThese people keep it in the pantry because they swear it can prevent  and possibly treat  stomach bugs. And they may be right, says microbiologist Dr Heather Cavanagh, whose research found some raspberry juice and blackcurrant juice cordials can kill at least 12 different types of nasty bacteria responsible for stomach bugs, including E. Coli and several strains of salmonella.\nCavanagh first became interested in the use of raspberry cordial as a preventative and treatment of stomach bugs when she heard that some farmers in parts of New South Wales and Victoria were adding raspberry cordial to their livestock's drinking water to treat diarrhoea.\nShe also began to hear stories of other people using raspberry cordial to treat stomach bugs: \"I heard anecdotal reports from as far away as Queensland and Western Australia, I heard of how people used it to treat themselves and their family. Not just their animals\".\nSo she decided to see if there was any science to support these anecdotal reports.\nIn the lab, Cavanagh tested juice made from a number of fresh berries  including raspberries, blackberries, blackcurrants, cranberries, mulberries, loganberries and boysenberries  as well as commercially available cordials made from these berries (these cordials were made with real berry juice, not apple juice and artificial colours as is sometimes the case).\nThese juices and cordials were then diluted down with water to different strengths, the strongest was one part water to five parts cordial and the weakest was 1:100. Then each type of bacteria was mixed with each of the berry drinks. The researchers found a number of the raspberry and blackcurrant juice cordials killed most of the bacteria.\nAnd while there has been some speculation that it's the sugar content of cordials that kills bacteria, Cavanagh says there is something unique to raspberry and blackcurrant juices, which seems to be responsible.\nThose cordials that had the best antibacterial properties contained at least 35 per cent raspberry or blackcurrant juice, and worked when diluted down to one part cordial in 10 parts water. Undiluted raspberry juice and blackcurrant juice worked just as well as the cordials.\nBut, Cavanagh says, there's a hitch. While her research suggests there's some truth to the red cordial story, there haven't been any clinical trials testing whether raspberry cordial can prevent or treat stomach bugs in humans or animals.\n\"We know for certain that adding the right amount of these cordials to water will reduce the number of bacteria in the water,\" she says.\n\"[But] we cannot say for certain that the cordial will definitely prevent stomach bugs in people, and we don't know yet if it will help as a treatment if you are already feeling sick. Although again there is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that it might.\"\nAnd even if red cordial does work, stomach bugs (gastroenteritis) are caused by a range of things other than bacteria  such as viruses, parasites, and certain medications  and raspberry cordial won't help in these cases.\nAlso be careful about drinking too much cordial (even diluted at a 1:10 ratio) if you have vomiting or diarrhoea. Drinks with a high sugar content  such as undiluted soft drinks, sports drinks, juices or strong cordials  can promote fluid loss into the bowel and worsen dehydration, which is a risk for anyone with vomiting and diarrhoea.\nDr Heather Cavanagh is a senior lecturer in microbiology at the School of Biomedical Sciences at Charles Sturt University. She spoke to Claudine Ryan."

        "text": "Authorities believe the carcass washed ashore around 3 a.m. Sunday, March 24. According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the whale is about 40-feet long, the size of a semi-truck. There are several gashes on the whale’s side, though it is still unclear how the whale died. More details will become available after Diane Alps, President of the Channel Island Marine and Wildlife Institute and her colleagues release information from a necropsy performed March 25. According to the CHP, authorities do not plan on removing the carcass of the whale and will instead let nature take its course and carry the body out to sea.\nWhile experts were performing the necropsy on the 40-foot long mammal, rescue crews just up the coast in Oxnard spent Monday attempting to rescue another gray whale trapped in a bouy net near Channel Island Harbour. Spotted by passengers on a boat Sunday, responders Monday and Tuesday had a difficult time untangling the whale, which is around 20-feet long, due to the animal’s skittishness.\n“Every time we tried to get close to it, the whale would get scared and dive underwater, taking the buoy with it,” Mark Barney, a spokesperson for the United States Coast Guard (USCG), told the Los Angeles Times.\nAccording to Barney, because the whale kept swimming away, authorities have been unable to tell if the whale is injured, distressed or to what degree the animal is entangled. To help with the rescue, the USCG called in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for assistance.\nIn the 17th century, gray whales were on the verge extinction due to commercial whaling, and while the Pacific Ocean population has since recovered, groups in the Atlantic Ocean never did. There are currently around 26,000 gray whales found throughout the world, all in the Pacific Ocean, and their Eastern North Pacific stock is the largest group. According to the Marine Mammal Center, gray whales have the longest migrations of any mammal.\nDuring summer, gray whales live in the Arctic in areas rich in their food, bottom-dwelling organisms. As fall arrives, however, there is less sunlight, less food, and the water turns cold, and the whales swim to Baja California, Mexico where they enter lagoons to give birth and mate. Therefore, gray whales can be observed passing by California in December and January during their southern migration, and again in March, April, and May on their northern journey. As human activity has increased along gray whales’ migration route, these mammals are facing a new set of challenges.\nWhile authorities have yet to determine the cause of the gray whale’s death in Malibu, the incident near Channel Island Harbour is a stark reminder of the impact human activity can have on these giant mammals."

        "text": "Asia Pacific|Iran Sent Them to Syria. Now Afghan Fighters Are a Worry at Home.\nIran Sent Them to Syria. Now Afghan Fighters Are a Worry at Home.\nYAKAWLANG, Afghanistan — Iran has trained and deployed thousands of Shiite Afghans as shock troops in Syria’s sectarian war. Members of the Afghan unit, the Fatemiyoun Division, wear a shoulder patch recounting words of praise from Iran’s supreme leader as a badge of honor.\nWhat those fighters might do when they come home is now very much on the minds of officials who fear that Afghanistan may become the next great sectarian battleground between Iran, as the declared guardian of Shiites, and Saudi Arabia, long the sponsor of conservative Sunni doctrine around the world.\nThere is reason for worry. First, there’s a history: The factional divisions that drove Afghanistan’s devastating civil war in the 1990s were seized on by foreign powers who were seeking proxies. And there’s a new concern: A stark increase in attacks against Afghanistan’s Shiite minority, mostly by Sunni extremists loyal to the Islamic State, is already providing Iran a pretext to increase its meddling in the country.\nThe attacks have received wide coverage in the Iranian news media. And one Fatemiyoun fighter who returned about three months ago from Syria said the violence against Afghan Shiites was a frequent topic raised by their commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\nThe Afghan fighter had returned to his home in Yakawlang, a village in Bamian Province where the Taliban massacred more than 300 Shiites in 2001. Every year, hundreds of residents kneel on the dirt in a hilltop cemetery and beat their chests in mourning for their loved ones, their names listed on a metal sign worn out by time and covered in rust.\n“The Guards commanders were saying that, if it comes to it, we will make Bamian into a base for you, a base for Fatemiyoun,” said the returning fighter, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being singled out for attack.\n“There was always talk about that; the commander would say that one day you will go defend in your own country,” said another fighter, who had lived in Iran for 20 years as a refugee before he joined to go to Syria. He said he enlisted after he saw a video of Islamic State fighters “playing football with a chopped head.” His relatives said he joined after a romantic heartbreak.\nIran has long relied more on soft power than armed might in Afghanistan, playing up its cultural, religious and economic influence in western Afghan districts near the border. And though Iran resents the presence of the United States military on its border, it has mostly supported the American-backed administration in Kabul, choosing stability over chaos.\nBut as the war in Afghanistan has stretched late into a second decade, and with the stability of the central government in question, Iran has begun hedging its bets, American and Afghan officials say. That has extended to improving its ties with the Taliban, a group it had long seen as an ideological enemy.\nAfghan officials acknowledge that they have not yet seen evidence that Iran was actively rallying Fatemiyoun veterans. But the officials are deeply concerned that the groundwork is being laid. And statements by Iran’s military leaders, as well as their use of Afghan fighters in other conflicts, suggests that Iran sees the force as an asset in future engagements.\nBrig. Gen. Ismail Qaani, the deputy commander of the Quds force within the Revolutionary Guards, recently told a memorial for Afghan fighters that Syria was just a temporary goal in a larger vision.\n“Fatemiyoun is a new culture — a collection of brave men who do not see boundaries and borders in defending Islamic values,” General Qaani said, as quoted in the local Iranian media.\nThe war in Yemen is one indication of how Afghans are already being drawn deeper into the Iranian-Saudi rivalry, on both sides. Not only did Iran send smaller units of the Fatemiyoun to cross Syrian borders and fight in Yemen, but at least 1,000 Sunni Afghan refugees from camps in Pakistan have also been recruited to fight on Saudi Arabia’s behalf in Yemen, according to three senior Afghan officials.\nThe core of what is now the Fatemiyoun Division included fighters from Shiite militias that had Iranian support during the Afghan civil war. Some even went to Iraq to fight on behalf of Iran against Saddam Hussein, or to Lebanon to oppose the Israeli invasion.\nMany of the Afghan fighters, mostly recruited from among Afghan refugees or illegal laborers in Iran, join for the salary of about $600 a month, and for the promise of Iranian residency paperwork after a deployment to Syria, which usually lasts three months. But they soon realize that the benefits are designed as a hook: The paperwork needs to be validated every year, and that requires enlisting again.\nAfghan officials say the Iranian police have intensified a crackdown on illegal Afghan immigrants, arresting as many as 200 a day. When they arrive at deportation centers, Iranian military officers are there to offer another option.\n“They said: ‘You had come from Afghanistan to work, to make money. We give you two options: You go to Syria, and we pay you money. Or you go back to your country,’” said the former fighter in Yakawlang, who asked to be identified only as Jawed. He was detained while working at an Iranian construction site and taken to a deportation center where, out of 200 Afghan detainees, he became one of about 60 who chose to serve in Syria. After returning to Afghanistan, he joined the Afghan Army.\nExtensive ideological indoctrination is a central part of their service. Recruits are told the war in Syria is a defense of some of the holiest shrines of the Shiite faith from attack by the Islamic State — a group their recruiters then describe as a creation of the United States to destabilize the Middle East.\n“My intention was Syria, to defend the shrine,” said the Afghan fighter who returned to his home in Yakawlang, and who wanted to be identified only by the name Abas.\nAbas described his fellow Afghan fighters being pitched into battles that resembled the brutality of the Afghan civil war.\nOther fighters described similarly heavy casualties. One said 15 of his comrades were killed on the first night they arrived at the front lines. And Jawed said there was a day when his unit lost 45 men.\nFollow Mujib Mashal and Fatima Faizi on Twitter: @MujMash and @FatmaFaizi."

        "text": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may soon need another name.\nTrump-appointed acting CFPB director Mick Mulvaney is working so furiously to dismantle the agency’s regulatory oversight and enforcement that a better moniker might be the Corporate Financial Protection Bureau.\nThe latest sign of this came May 9, when Mulvaney sent a bureau-wide memo announcing his decision to shutter the CFPB office that investigates potential student loan abuses and fraud.\nIt’s hard to overstate the importance of the CFPB in helping student borrowers, who have been routinely scammed and misled. Over the past nine years, the agency’s Office for Students and Young Consumers recovered $750 million for students defrauded by lenders and con artists.\nThe student lending office also helped more than 60,000 students from every state get answers about breakdowns in their loan process. It sued predatory loan processors and for-profit colleges, including Navient and ITT Tech. It stamped out illegal loan servicing practices at the country’s largest banks, including Citibank, Discover and Wells Fargo.\nThe CFPB did not respond to questions about the decision by publication time, but did reply after the story was published (see update below).\nMulvaney has stated he is moving the responsibilities of the Office for Students and Young Consumers under the broad umbrella of “financial education.” He has also announced a more sweeping reorganization of the bureau, including the creation of an Office of Cost-Benefit Analysis.\nLenders and conservative media, however, have been unusually quiet about Mulvaney's memo. Meanwhile, the closure of the student lending office sparked outrage among Democrats and consumer groups.\n“Once again, Mick Mulvaney has proven how little he thinks of the Consumer Bureau, the fine men and women who work there and the people they serve,” said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) in a press release on May 9.\nWaters also lambasted Mulvaney’s reshuffling of the agency.\nAlso slamming the decision is Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who called for Mulvaney’s resignation from both the CFPB and his job as White House budget director over Mulvaney's recent “pay to play” remarks to lobbyists and bankers.\nOther lawmakers criticizing Mulvaney’s decision include Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Oregon).\nThe Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, the Center for Responsible Lending, the Center for American Progress and other groups have also condemned the move to eliminate the consumer watchdog.\nUpdate: Several hours after the story was published, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau press office responded to the questions I had sent earlier. Responding to whether the CFPB intended to keep the same number of investigators and continue to pursue the Navient lawsuit, the agency stated, \"We'll decline to comment on pending litigation.\""

        "text": "For politicians, compromise can be a surprisingly hard word. So it is today over the Brexit endgame. The talk is still of crashing out, no deals and blood red lines. But this is paradoxical. Politics, like life itself, is mostly built on compromises. That is why the Brexit sherpas are, in fact, still talking in Brussels and London. Even on Brexit, it remains likelier than not that the practical human instinct to compromise will eventually have its way.\nThis is not, though, the certainty it ought logically to be. Brexit is not simply another political process to be settled through compromise. To many, it is also a series of absolutes. One is that Britain’s vote to leave the European Union was not just decisive but the immutable will of an entire people that cannot be questioned – or compromised. A second, never properly understood in Westminster, is that the EU sees leaving as a treaty process governed by rules that cannot be bent.\nYet, as the writer Fintan O’Toole argued in a lecture this week, Brexit is not in practice monolithic. Indeed, Brexit metamorphosed at the precise moment that the leave vote was declared in 2016. With that declaration, Brexit moved from being a reactionary vision of restored British national destiny to being a practical and complicated task for politicians to sort out.\nMore than two years on, it still is. For the fanatical leavers, Brexit remains what O’Toole calls an epic dream. That is one reason why people such as Boris Johnson refuse to accept ownership of the Brexit detail. For passionate remainers, it is the exact opposite, an epic nightmare against which only a second referendum, negating the collective national sin of the first, will suffice. Somewhere in the middle, however, stretching from deep inside the leave vote across the Brexit divide to somewhere well into remain, there are the many who now simply want a compromise they can live with.\nTheresa May is the flawed and awkward tribune of these pragmatists. It is a major part of her failure that she has never properly embraced this inescapable role. After 2016, she could and should have reached out to remainers by pledging to secure as moderate a Brexit as possible. Instead, she threw in her lot with the fundamentalist leavers in speeches to the 2016 Tory conference and at Lancaster House. This led remainers – and, just as important, the EU27 – to conclude that she wanted nothing more than a vestigial free trade deal and a minimum of regulatory cooperation.\nSince her failed general election, and in a characteristically last-minute, crabwise manner, May has sometimes crept towards a more centrist position. But she has done it in the least politically intelligent way possible. Instead of trying to use Brexit to reimagine modern Britain in a fairer way, as, at his best, her former adviser Nick Timothy urged her to do, she used it to indulge post-imperial fantasists on the right of the Tory party and the press, and to embrace forms of Ulster unionism that are rooted in the 1920s not the 2020s.\nMay should have embraced some of the language and ideas of “soft” Brexit from the start. By doing so, especially after her June 2017 election catastrophe,she could have laid the ground for the necessary later cross-party understandings on the Brexit deal. She could, in particular, have tried to win round the SNP by pledging to devolve EU competences to Holyrood. And she could have tried to reach agreements with Labour on the customs union, Northern Ireland and employment rules. Instead, she allowed herself to become the hostage of incompetent and lazy rightwingers in her own party and the puppet of a sectarian DUP.\nNow, however, the Brexit process is approaching the crunch. Or rather, two umbilically-connected crunches. Crunch one will be over an agreement with the EU. Because the EU, not Britain, holds most of the cards, this agreement will either be softer than Chequers, in which case the Tory right will reject it, or harder, in which case the left will say no. It will not be the cherry-picking, bespoke deal May has promoted for the last two years.\nCrunch two will be getting the deal through parliament. This cannot be done by relying on Conservatives alone, since there is no Tory majority and because a significant minority of Tory MPs will oppose the deal, whatever form it takes. Even if the DUP backs May, the chances are that she will need opposition support. That is why she should have opened out to Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats during the past year. And why she still should.\nMost of the media attention about the parliamentary arithmetic has focused so far on how Tory backbenchers will vote. Yet, when and if this second crunch point is reached, pro-Europeans on the opposition benches will face a crucial dilemma too. Do they vote for May’s deal in order to avoid no deal? Or do they vote with Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson to crash out? There will be immense party pressure on these MPs to vote down May’s deal. But there will be significant public pressure in the other direction too, demanding that opposition MPs give May’s deal a chance, avert a cliff-edge crash, and allow the country the opportunity to move beyond Brexit.\nThe power of this dilemma will clearly depend on the content of the deal itself. For many remainers, voting for any form of Brexit will be a step too far in any circumstances. For more pragmatic remainers, though, the temptation to back a deal, depending on the softness of its content and the degree of compromise made by May, and which has also been agreed by the EU27, will be a serious option. Faced with a choice between an imperfect deal that retained significant connections to Europe, and no deal with Europe at all, many pro-Europeans may decide it is time for them to compromise too, because, like it or not, they have a dog in this fight."

        "text": "In 2004, Google promised to transform philanthropy. That goal remains elusive.\nJUST before Google first sold its shares to the public in 2004, Larry Page, one of its founders, excited the nonprofit world with a bold commitment to philanthropy.\nHe vowed to dedicate about 1 percent of Google’s profits, 1 percent of its equity and a significant amount of its employees’ time to the effort, which became known as Google.org, or simply DotOrg. “We hope someday this institution may eclipse Google itself in terms of overall world impact by ambitiously applying innovation and significant resources to the largest of the world’s problems,” Mr. Page wrote in a letter to potential investors.\nAlthough Google intended to tackle major problems like climate change, global poverty and the spread of pandemic diseases, it declared that DotOrg would not be “conventional” — a four-letter word in Google-speak. For starters, the organization would operate in part as a business, thus freeing itself from various constraints placed on nonprofit groups.\nGoogle hired Larry Brilliant, a public health expert and Silicon Valley entrepreneur with no experience running a major philanthropy, to lead DotOrg, which was set up as a business unit within the company. It then poached prominent experts in development, energy and public health from prestigious institutions like the Aga Khan Foundation, Goldman Sachs and the International Water Management Institute.\nNearly five years later, however, the hyperbole looks more like hubris. DotOrg has narrowed to just one octave on the piano: engineering-related projects that often are the outgrowth of existing Google products. Dr. Brilliant was sidelined in early 2009 after his loose management style created much disenchantment in DotOrg’s ranks.\nThe company’s top executives rarely mention DotOrg, which is now run by Megan Smith, a business development executive who devotes only part of her time to the organization.\nAlthough Google gives tens of millions of dollars to charity each year and says the overall company is meeting its 1 percent giving goal, DotOrg itself is no longer making grants to nonprofit groups or financing new companies. Instead, it focuses on projects like using Google Earth to track environmental changes and monitoring Web searches to detect flu outbreaks. Most of the experts it initially hired have left, and Google, a company obsessed with numbers and metrics, struggles to measure DotOrg’s accomplishments.\nGoogle says it has changed its approach to philanthropy, but not its scope or ambition. Ms. Smith readily acknowledges that the organization has yet to prove itself, but she says it has already had a positive impact in various areas, such as public health and the environment.\nIn the philanthropy world, many people have a more skeptical view of Google’s experiment.\nNOTHING illustrates DotOrg’s approach better than Google Flu Trends, an innovative tool that uses data collected from searches about flu symptoms to predict the location of flu outbreaks. In April 2009, Dr. Brilliant said it epitomized the power of Google’s vaunted engineering prowess to make the world a better place, and he predicted that it would save untold numbers of lives.\nPublic health officials say the tool is undoubtedly useful.\nBut “on an individual basis, does Flu Trends save lives? No,” said Ashley LaMonte-Fowlkes, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which helped Google test and develop it.\nInstead, she described it as “a really nice adjunct” to other tools that the agency uses to understand the spread of flu. One major shortcoming of Flu Trends is that in poor regions of the developing world, where devastating pandemics are most likely to start, computers are not widely available, so Google has little data to feed into the tool. Even in the United States, during the swine flu outbreak of 2009, Flu Trends had difficulty detecting the relatively small number of H1N1 infections.\nSome veterans of DotOrg say Flu Trends is an example of how Google’s engineering-centric approach frustrated and limited them.\nThose solutions also had to be something that Google engineers, who represent the cream of the world’s elite universities, believed that only they could create.\nFor instance, in early 2008, some DotOrg staff members with traditional nonprofit backgrounds proposed a system to track drugs for diseases like malaria and tuberculosis through the supply chain, in order to combat drug counterfeiting and theft. Fake drugs, which can be toxic, are an enormous problem: the World Health Organization has estimated that more than 30 percent of drugs sold in developing countries in Africa and parts of Asia and Latin America can be counterfeit.\nThe team’s idea was to engineer a FedEx-type system, relying in part on text-messaging, that would track drugs from the moment they left a manufacturer’s control until they reached a patient.\nThe plan never went anywhere, however, because text-messaging was not sophisticated enough to challenge Google’s engineers, several former DotOrg executives said. The culture clash between the engineers — caustically referred to by former DotOrg executives as “the Brahmin” — and those from development organizations was exacerbated by DotOrg’s leader, Dr. Brilliant, according to a dozen former employees of DotOrg.\nEven Dr. Brilliant’s fans — and they are legion in Silicon Valley and the global health arena — say he lacks management skills. A spokesman for Dr. Brilliant’s current employer, the Skoll Global Threats Fund, said last week that he was unavailable for an interview because of a death in his immediate family. Dr. Brilliant did respond to some questions by e-mail, though he did not reply to a question about his management.\nHe was hired on a whim after he won the coveted TED Prize, awarded annually to someone with a world-changing “wish,” in 2006 for his idea to build a global early-response system to identify new diseases and disasters as soon as they emerge, thus heading off pandemics. Dr. Brilliant was invited to speak to Google employees about his idea, and Mr. Page and his Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, happened to attend.\nThey were smitten, and Dr. Brilliant was hired almost immediately. It took DotOrg almost two years to define the five areas in which it would work, and they were announced with much fanfare in January 2008: predicting and preventing diseases; growing small and midsize businesses; increasing access to information and public services; developing renewable energy; and helping to commercialize plug-in hybrids. Google.org vowed to spend $175 million in those areas over the next three years.\nIt troubled several DotOrg executives that the largest grant announced that day, accounting for 20 percent of the $25 million committed at the time, went to InStedd, the organization that Dr. Brilliant had founded with his TED prize money.\n“No one seemed to understand that this looked like a tremendous conflict of interest,” said one former DotOrg employee who oversaw programs and asked for anonymity because Google’s severance contract included a confidentiality clause.\nDuring Dr. Brilliant’s tenure as executive director of DotOrg, InStedd received $11 million from the institution, while the Seva Foundation, another nonprofit that he had co-founded, received $2.5 million.\nIn an e-mail, Dr. Brilliant said the grant to Seva illustrated Google’s “don’t be evil” mantra: Mr. Brin ordered it up to make Seva whole after Google hired Dr. Brilliant away.\nDr. Brilliant also had to deal with other issues. On a personal level, he was distracted during part of his time at DotOrg because two family members were critically ill.\nIt didn’t help that Sheryl Sandberg, a Google executive who was the architect of DotOrg as it was first conceived, left to join Facebook in early 2008. Ms. Sandberg’s first job out of college was with the World Bank in India, and many DotOrg executives considered her their champion.\nWhen she left, DotOrg became isolated. It operated out of San Francisco, rather than from Google’s campus in Mountain View, Calif. And with its executives spending most of their time in the developing world and thus unable to cultivate allies at the company, DotOrg all but ground to a halt.\nDr. Brilliant lacked Ms. Sandberg’s access to the Executive Management Group, which comprises about a dozen senior Google executives close to Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s longtime chief executive, who is moving to a new role as executive chairman in April. (Mr. Page, meanwhile, will become C.E.O.) Members of this group were usually too busy to attend meetings where grants were presented for approval, so Dr. Brilliant worked out a system of e-mailing the proposals to Mr. Page and Mr. Brin. If they did not respond within 48 hours, he made the decision himself.\nLAURENCE SIMON, a professor at Brandeis University and a friend of Dr. Brilliant’s who took a sabbatical to work at DotOrg in 2007, said that in his view, Google’s top executives grew frustrated with DotOrg when they were not being presented with clearly defined problems and solutions.\n“I think they expected there would be the same kind of ‘launch early and often’ approach demanded on the business side, but that’s not the way development works,” Mr. Simon said.\nWhen the Google founders did attend a meeting about DotOrg, they spent most of their time fiddling with their BlackBerrys. At one meeting, former DotOrg executives said, they were stunned when Mr. Brin dropped to the floor and started doing push-ups.\n“DotOrg was like quicksand — every time you thought you’d found your footing, a sinkhole opened,” the former Google.org program officer said.\nJacquelline Fuller, a spokeswoman for DotOrg, said Mr. Brin, Mr. Page and Mr. Schmidt were not available to discuss the organization.\nBy the end of 2008, many of the DotOrg executives hired from the outside had left in frustration, and morale ratings were among the lowest in the company, according to an employee survey. Mr. Schmidt was prodded by other Google executives to review and restructure the operation.\nAfter the review, Google suspended all grants that were not quite final. Grants were canceled to institutions like Harvard and Stanford for research projects in Africa even though Google’s senior management had approved them and they lacked only a final signature on the contracts.\nMr. Schmidt moved DotOrg to the Mountain View campus in early 2009. That February, Dr. Brilliant was given the title “chief philanthropic evangelist,” and left the organization soon after to join the Skoll Global Threats Fund. Ms. Smith took over DotOrg.\nEngineers from outside DotOrg were assigned to review all of the grants it had made. Not surprisingly, they wanted to know why there wasn’t more engineering in, say, a grant made to assess the quality of basic education in Tanzania’s schools. They also wanted to know why DotOrg wasn’t working more to “scale” up small projects to have a broader impact.\n“They never understood that technology is a means to an end, and that in the developing world, sometimes basic technology, like the collection and compilation of data, can have enormous impact,” said another DotOrg program officer, who resigned after the reorganization.\nIn the end, many grants were labeled “legacy” and discontinued when they expired.\nIN devising what DotOrg would become after Dr. Brilliant, the company went back to the Flu Trends model. It has developed a series of tools based on existing Google technologies, including PowerMeter, which lets people track their home energy use in real time, and Earth Engine, which uses Google Earth and satellite imagery to monitor aspects of the earth’s environment, including deforestation.\nSo far, PowerMeter has failed to gain widespread adoption, in part because there are a number of competing products and many utilities did not get behind the idea.\nEarth Engine, which Google released last month, offers more promise. It includes years of satellite imagery of the planet, and lets scientists use Google’s cloud-computing infrastructure to analyze it.\nDotOrg’s projects related to green energy have received more attention from Google’s top brass, since they are pet projects of the founders and fit with the company’s broader, for-profit investments in clean energy technologies.\nThe organization’s engineers are working on technology that would make solar energy less expensive and more efficient as part of an initiative to develop renewable energy cheaper than coal. Another effort, to accelerate the development of plug-in cars, has its roots in the original DotOrg. The company worked to modify a fleet of hybrids to draw power from the grid and set up charging stations on its campus.\nGoogle says it cannot easily separate the impact it has had in bringing plug-in hybrids closer to reality from that of others, like General Motors and Toyota, that are also promoting the technology. “Google was one of the entities helping to create the meme that plug-in hybrids are coming,” Ms. Smith said.\nDotOrg has also developed tools to respond to disasters, such as a database to track missing people after the earthquake in Haiti. There is also Resource Finder, a map-based tool set up after Pakistan’s floods that helps relief workers locate available hospital beds.\nJust as important as the projects themselves, Ms. Smith said, is the formal process for reviewing DotOrg proposals. The ideas, which can now be proposed by any Google employee, are handled very much the way Google handles any idea from its staff — with a rigorous product review. The process lays the foundation for many more projects in coming years, she said.\nGoogle puts its overall giving last year at $184 million, including in-kind contributions. Roughly half that amount went to nonprofit groups as cash. An additional 20 percent went to universities under a program that also gives the company an inside track on promising young engineers and research. Just 15 percent went to DotOrg projects.\n“We have ramped up our charitable giving, but it is now being done outside of DotOrg by other teams, which has allowed DotOrg to focus on developing engineering solutions,” said Ms. Fuller, the DotOrg spokeswoman who was recently named Google’s director of charitable giving, in an e-mail.\nTHE reorganization has made it hard to assess whether Google is living up to its original promise. Many of the grants Google makes to organizations like Citizen Schools, Landesa, Ashoka and Unicef seem more like conventional corporate philanthropy than the revolutionary social innovation that Mr. Page pledged.\nIndeed, Ms. Fuller measures the philanthropic success of Google by comparing its giving with that of other companies. “I think the big picture is that relative to its peers, Google has been generous with its time and resources,” she wrote."

        "text": "To the apparent surprise of everyone, the Walt Disney Company has announced a deal to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. According to the official press release, Disney has agreed to fork over $4.05 billion in cash and stock for George Lucas’ studio in a deal that brings together two of the world’s most important intellectual property libraries.\nAs you might expect, Disney is itching to take advantage of its new toys. “This transaction combines a world-class portfolio of content including Star Wars, one of the greatest family entertainment franchises of all time, with Disney’s unique and unparalleled creativity across multiple platforms, businesses, and markets to generate sustained growth and drive significant long-term value,” said Disney CEO Robert Iger in this afternoon’s announcement.\nUnder the terms of this agreement Disney will acquire control over all Lucasfilm iterations. This includes both its traditional film-making studio facilities, as well as the various technologies Lucasfilm has created over the years to further its various media properties. Thus, the gigantic Disney family now includes Lucasfilm itself, special effects house Industrial Light & Magic, Skywalker Sound and LucasArts, the company’s video game creation division.\nThis acquisition alone would be huge news, but as if to pre-empt fan speculation on the future of Star Wars the same announcement also mentions that a new Star Wars movie is scheduled to appear in 2015. Though the vast majority of recent Star Wars media has been focused on the property’s various animated iterations and LEGO crossovers, this new film will be the first official cinematic continuation of George Lucas’ original Star Wars trilogy. Though very few details are offered on this film, it has officially been dubbed Star Wars: Episode VII, and barring any major catastrophes it should hit theaters at some point in 2015 (if we had to guess, we’d assume an early summer release in keeping with the tradition established by its predecessors).\nPerhaps even more intriguing however, is the announcement’s claim that Episode VII’s release will herald a new era in which new Star Wars movies hit theaters “every two to three years.” It specifically mentions Episodes VIII and IX by name, though offers no solid details on either film.\nWhile the effects of the move won’t be fully known for at least a few months, we can think of a number of a things this new union might change. For instance, currently Dark Horse Comics publishes all Star Wars comic books, but with Disney owning Marvel Comics we can’t see that agreement lasting for long. Likewise, both Disney and Lucasfilm have sizable divisions dedicated to creating video games based on their various media properties. Normally these companies have had to seek outside publishing agreements, but now that they’ve joined forces and massively expanded the number of games either company is capable of releasing in any given year, it makes a lot of sense for Disney to invest in its own games publishing wing.\nFinally, this agreement almost certainly heralds future crossovers between Disney and Lucasfilm characters. We don’t know any specifics, but it’s only a matter of time before we see toys depicting Mickey Mouse dressed as Darth Vader. Whether that sounds awesome or stomach-churningly disgusting is entirely up to your rapidly waning sense of childhood whimsy.\nUpdate: Scratch that last prediction. Apparently Disney characters dressed as Star Wars characters is already a thing.\nOur partnership with LucasFilm has produced over 20 yrs worth of stories. We have Star Wars for the near future, and hope for years to come."

Tackles are there to be won and they are no longer soccer’s fancy Dans.\n“If people want to take us on they can...but beware,” Wenger said. “I still say Gallas’s challenge wasn’t nasty – he wanted to win the ball. One tackle and it’s different. We have learned to look after ourselves.\"\nThe fourth-round tie against Stoke today will provide a stern test of their appetite for confrontation, given the stormy encounter and subsequent war of words the last time the sides met at the Britannia Stadium, when Wenger complained that his players had been intentionally hurt.\nBut Wenger is ready for a battle this time. He said: “If Stoke’s approach is aggressive, I won’t mind. When you go there you know what to expect. You also need to compete. For us that is not enough – the first is to compete, the rest is to play.\"\nOne man who disagrees with Wenger’s view is Stoke boss Tony Pulis, who reckons Arsenal are not as tough as when Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit were patrolling the Highbury midfield. Pulis said: “If you look back at the team from a few years ago, they had Vieira and Petit. Now that was an unbelievably strong team.\"\nTo keep the bite in his side, Wenger will have to ensure that he keeps Gallas. The Arsenal manager revealed that his fellow Frenchman has refused all new contract offers and said: “He is a free agent soon. He could leave.” Wenger is concerned that a seething anger has remained in Gallas ever since he was stripped of the captaincy for petulance.\nWenger said: “Since the beginning of the season he has been outstanding and I don’t want to lose him.\""

        "text": "In days gone by, when our economy was dominated by agriculture and manufacturing, an employee’s value was gauged by their inputs into the company. If they slacked off by not placing a bumper on a car fast enough, they were unproductive. And if they slept on the job, they were stealing time from their employers and could be fired.\nToday, however, we live in what is largely a knowledge economy in which an employee’s value is based on their outputs, not their inputs. This means their performance is often more about ultimate results and less about the hours clocked.\nIn the knowledge economy, we want employees to be alert, not just active; engaged, not just present. We want them to be focused on producing the highest quality outputs possible.\nSleeping on the job can make this happen.\nAccording to the National Safety Council in the United States, almost 70 percent of employees are tired at work.\nThis level of fatigue is estimated to cost US$410 billion annually in societal expenses. As I discuss in my latest book “Boost: The science of recharging yourself in an age of unrelenting demands“, healthy adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep a night, but many of us don’t get enough shut-eye.\nThirty-five percent of the population gets less than seven hours of sleep per night. Between 1985 and 2012 the percentage of adults in the United States who slept less than six hours a night increased by over 30 percent. And, compared to 60 years ago, today people get one and a half to two hours less sleep every night.\nThe ensuing sleepiness results in potential dangers both on and off the job. For example, about one in 25 drivers report having fallen asleep at the wheel in the last 30 days.\nThe problem is so bad that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers inadequate sleep to be a public health epidemic.\nPart of the explanation for this level of fatigue is that the boundary between work and home is blurring. Ninety-five percent of Americans now own a cellphone and 77 percent own a smartphone.\nAs a result of the ubiquity of communication technologies, employees can now be contacted any time of the day or night, on or off the job. Research shows that 84 percent of employees report having to be available after hours at least some of the time.\nThis essentially puts employees “on call.” And guess what happens when people are on call? They don’t sleep as well.\nSo not only do societal trends reveal an overall reduction in sleep duration, technological trends that blur the boundary between work and home are intensifying our inability to get adequate sleep. This is tragic because work tires us out and sleep is one of the most important recovery mechanisms that exist.\nTo combat the epidemic of sleepiness, we should allow the blurring of the line between work and home to go both ways. If employees are going to be required to be available after hours, they should also be allowed to sleep on the job.\nIf employers are going to interfere with employees’ leisure time and their ability to recover from their daily job demands, organizations should then provide opportunities for the needed recovery to occur at work.\nThere is a strong business case for this. Naps as short as 10 to 30 minutes can increase alertness, reduce fatigue and improve performance. Not only that, but recent research suggests that napping may be as effective as drugs at reducing blood pressure. That’s means organizations that implement napping policies can save on health-care costs.\nMany companies, such as Ben & Jerry’s, Zappos, and Nike, allow employees to nap at work. I believe this trend represents the workplace of the future.\nThe idea that employees should not be allowed to sleep on the job is an outdated taboo from a bygone era. It is a holdover from the days when an employee’s value depended solely on his or her manual inputs.\nIn the modern economy, however, your value as an employee, manager, or executive often rests on your ability to produce desirable outputs. Tuned in organizations recognize that fatigued employees can’t perform at their best. In essence, a tired employee is stealing performance from their employer.\nIn the modern economy, if you are tired and not sleeping on the job, you should be fired.\nJamie Gruman is a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Guelph in Canada.

We've seen contemporary variations of these to converted shepherd's wagons covered with canvas and actually used as rustic living spaces. Ontario-based Canadian builder Güte (previously) constructed this lovely specimen that seems to be a cross between a shepherd's wagon, a camper and modernist tiny home. Dubbed the Collingwood, it sports rounded surfaces and nice, clean wooden surfaces inside.\nWe built the Collingwood shepherd hut without clear distinctions of where the walls become the floor or roof of this shepherd hut. It is wrapped in and organic shell that fulfills the functions of all three of these important traditional structural elements. We wrapped the roof all the way around the Collingwood in a fluid wooden framed structure that sheds off every kind of bad weather. The exterior shell is fully insulated with batt insulation and waterproofed using the best ice and water shield. We use a combination of two types of roof cladding which will keep the weather out for a lifetime.\nThere are thermal-paned windows that open, a solid oak dutch door, cast-iron wheels, traditional cast-iron push hardware and brass window locks, cedar shingles and steel roof cladding. It has two electrical outlets, and can be plugged in via the exterior. But there's a lot of camper-ish inspirations here too, as evidenced by the classic dining-table-turns-into-bed gambit.\nThe 15-foot Collingwood can fit a whole family, thanks to the bunk bed off to the other side of the space, which has yet another roll-out storage platform tucked underneath, which could probably double as yet another bed. There's a wall unit that hosts storage and a fold-down table as well.\nWith no built-in bathroom or kitchen, this is a pretty basic setup priced for USD $23,098. But the meticulous craftsmanship and interesting hybrid design may be worth it for those who want to live the modern shepherd lifestyle.

        "text": "While the Gujarat government may have announced an incentive scheme to attract new investment in the textile value chain, existing units in the state fear that the same could affect their operations.\nAlready reeling from sluggish economy, coupled with an accumulated input tax credit under the goods and services tax (GST) regime, existing textile units across the value chain fear incentivising new units would mean stiffer competition for them.\nWith the state’s textile policy expiring on September 3, 2018, the Gujarat government recently announced a ‘Scheme for Assistance to Strengthen Specific Sectors in the Textile Value Chain’ effective from September 4, 2018, to December 31, 2023. As against the policy that attracted fresh investments in ginning, spinning and garmenting, the assistance scheme covers segments such as weaving, knitting, dyeing/printing, machine carpeting, technical textile, composite units and other activities in the textile value chain such as embroidery, winding, sizing, twisting and crimping.\nThe scheme provides financial assistance through credit-linked interest subsidy of six per cent for micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and 4-6 per cent for large enterprises, with an upper ceiling of Rs 20 crore per annum. Further, the scheme offers subsidy in power tariff of up to Rs 3 per unit for weaving, and Rs 2 per unit for other eligible segments with a validity of five years.\n“The assistance scheme for textile value chain is meant for new units being set up in Gujarat. However, there is nothing for the existing scheme. On the basis of the subsidy, the newer units would be more cost-effective, and compete with us on price difference. Already, the existing textile industry in Gujarat is struggling because of multiple reasons. Hence, we are going to ask the state government for some relief against the new scheme,” said Jitu Vakharia, president of South Gujarat Textile Processors’ Association (SGTPA).\nAlready, around 30 textile processing units have been shut in recent months, with the remaining 320 odd units functioning at only 70 per cent of the original capacity. Surat, the biggest textile market in the state, alone has seen daily production fall from 40 million metre per day to 25 million metre per day.\nAccording to industry sources, based on the subsidy under the new scheme, newer units could carry a 15-20 per cent production cost advantage over the existing ones.\n“Any such policy is for new investment, but this aggravates the scenario for the existing units. Earlier, we were facing competition from outside, but now the competition will be closer home. It is only now that the industry is reviving in terms of growing demand in the last fortnight or so. The move could pull us back unless similar benefits are provided for the existing units,” said Ashish Gujarati, president of the Pandesara Weavers’ Association.\nApparently, the scheme also offers assistance covering all existing units which are compliant with the government’s energy, water and environment conservation norms, and have been in operation for more than three years.\nThe scheme provides 20 per cent assistance on the cost of machinery with a ceiling of Rs 30 lakh, and 50 per cent assistance for audit fees with a limit of Rs 1 lakh. The benefits can be availed once in two years during the operative period of the scheme.\nFurther, a one-time financial assistance of up to 50 per cent of cost, with a limit of Rs 25 lakh, is provided for technology upgrade and modernisation in textile value chain. The scheme provides assistance of up to 25 per cent of capital expenditure on common facilities and infrastructure, with a limit of Rs 15 crore for setting up textile parks."

Katz was 72.\n\"He loved his family and his friends and they loved him back in return. We've lost a great friend,\" Marimow said.\nAll seven people aboard the private plane died in the crash, according to multiple reports. The Gulfstream IV, which was departing Bedford-based airport Hanscom Field, crashed and caught on fire around 9:40 p.m. ET Saturday as it was leaving for Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey, according to Philly.com. The Massachusetts Port Authority did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment.\nEmergency personnel are at the scene of the accident, and Hanscom is currently closed for operations, according to a Port Authority release.\nJeff Patterson, who lives beside the airport's runway, told The Boston Globe that the plane exploded in a blast, which caused black smoke and flames to rise 60 feet in the air.\nKatz and co-owner H.F. \"Gerry\" Lenfest bought out their partners for $88 million Tuesday, gaining control of the media company, which owns the Inquirer, Philly.com and the Philadelphia Daily News.\n\"We all deeply mourn the loss of my true friend and fellow investor in ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com,\" Lenfest said, according to Philly.com. \"It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that Drew Katz, Lewis' son, will replace his father on the board of our new company.\"\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is currently investigating the cause of the crash, according to multiple reports."

        "text": "Less time for Common Core testing?\nStudents in 11 states and the District of Columbia will spend less time next year taking tests based on the Common Core standards, a decision made in response to widespread opposition to testing requirements.\nDENVER – Students in 11 states and the District of Columbia will spend less time next year taking tests based on the Common Core standards, a decision made in response to widespread opposition to testing requirements.\nThe decision to reduce testing time by about 90 minutes was made by the states and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for Colleges and Career, or PARCC.\nThe PARCC tests are administered to students in grades three to eight and once in high school. As a result of the decision, the math and English exams will only be given once a year, instead of twice.\nThe 11 states involved are Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio and Rhode Island.\n“We’ve listened to the voices of all stakeholders — educators, parents, and students — and are using the lessons learned,” New Mexico Education Secretary Hanna Skandera said in a statement.\nThe PARCC tests took effect this year and sparked a round of intense opposition from teachers, parents and students who said testing requirements take away from classroom instruction and put undue pressure on kids. Parents in pockets of the country opted their children out of test taking in PARCC states and elsewhere.\nJulia Sass Rubin, the mother of a seventh-grader in New Jersey and a founder of Save Our Schools New Jersey, a group that is critical of the test, said the reduced time is a good first step. She was among thousands of New Jersey parents who boycotted the tests.\nMike Wetzel, spokesman for the Colorado Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, welcomed the decision. “But as a country, we still over-test and we want to see some significant changes in Washington next year,” he said.\nWetzel was referring to the congressional debate to overhaul the No Child Left Behind education law, which has annual testing requirements.\nColorado is among the states that didn’t wait for PARCC to reduce exam time. On the same day the PARCC reduction was made, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed into law a reduction in testing before third grade and later in high school. Similar testing reductions have been passed in many states affiliated with the Common Core standards, which spell out what skills students should be able to master at each grade level.\n“There needs to be some sort of evaluation and testing, but we need to allow local districts to use what works for them,” said Colorado state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, a rancher who made headlines earlier this year for taking a PARCC test and failing it. Sonnenberg got the answers right, but didn’t show his work.\n“There’s a lot of problems with these tests and it’s good they’re reducing them, but we have more to look at,” Sonnenberg said.\nPARCC is one of two exams developed by groups of states and tied to the Common Core standards. The other is Smarter Balanced.\nAssociated Press Writer Geoff Mulvihill contributed to this report from Haddonfield, New Jersey."

        "text": "Getting involved with a volunteer fire department is an incredibly rewarding way to make a positive contribution to your community. It is often a stepping stone to starting a career in a full-time fire department.\nThat said, it’s not something that everyone can undertake. It takes a great deal physical stamina and mental strength to make this kind of commitment.\nWhat should I know about becoming a volunteer firefighter?\nKeep a clear head in life-or-death situations.\nMaintain your composure when assisting traumatic events like auto crash injuries and fatalities.\nPut yourself in extreme situations, such as going into burning buildings, crawling through tight spaces and entering other hazardous environments.\nMost volunteer fire departments want you to devote a minimum amount of time to service, so make sure you have time in your schedule and the flexibility to make that work. It also means that you must have the time to devote to the requisite firefighter training course. The length of the training can vary by state and the level of certification required — a Firefighter I certification may take six months of attending class two to three days per week.\nYou must also commit to staying in great physical condition to maintain the stamina to perform the necessary firefighting tasks. Eat right, exercise and reduce or eliminate habits that can adversely affect your health, like tobacco and alcohol use. Here are three specific steps to take to become a volunteer firefighter.\nThe first step should always be to make sure that there is a need. During your call or visit, ask questions about the process so you understand what to expect as you become a volunteer firefighter.\nIf there isn’t a volunteer fire station in your community, check out surrounding areas.\nSome fire departments do have residency restrictions, so ask about those in your call.\nCall the non-emergency number and avoid tying up the fire dispatcher.\nMany fire stations will welcome you to drop in if they’re not busy.\nSome fire departments let you ride along with them, or tour their station to give you firsthand experience working in fire safety.\nThey can also direct you to the proper authorities to help you get signed up.\nA background check to see if you have anything in your history that would prevent you from becoming a volunteer firefighter.\nClearance by a doctor or a physical ability test, some fire departments require both.\nFire departments controlled by a municipal government often require a full application process, usually including a drug test.\nIf your application is approved, the next step in becoming a volunteer fireman or firewoman is to take the training course. The time requirement of these programs varies, but all firefighters must take a minimum 110-hour National Fire Protection Association-certified course.\nWhile this may not be as glamorous as fighting fires, all are an important part of running a volunteer fire department.\nMany departments offer emergency medical services and encourage members to earn EMS certifications. Being an EMT prior to applying to the station will boost your odds of acceptance in many cases.\nWhatever capacity you choose to become involved in with your local volunteer fire department, it will most likely be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life."

        "text": "The business of weather has changed dramatically since former WCCO Minneapolis chief meteorologist Paul Douglas exited the station world in 2008. An entrepreneur with a handful of multi-million-dollar weather-tech startups to his credit, Douglas launched the syndicated weather outfit WeatherNation a few months after he was laid off, with the aim of providing weather content to stations and other media outlets across the country.\nHe envisioned a large quantity of his business coming from supplying weather talent remotely from his Twin Cities headquarters for stations that perhaps had downsized. But as media consumption habits have changed, with users increasingly accessing weather information when and how they want it on their iPhones and Droids, WeatherNation is more in tune with products for people on the go.\nWeather is an enormous driver of traffic to local news. However, a small but vocal group of industry watchers say viewers, with a world of sophisticated weather content at their fingertips, are increasingly unwilling to sit through the bulk of their late newscast—and its multiple teases—to find out if they need to bring an umbrella to work the next day.\nAsking station bosses to rethink what&apos;s long been a vital part of their newscast is no small order. An informal panel of 20 local TV executives revealed a nearly unanimous belief that weather—both severe and uneventful—would continue to draw hordes of viewers even after the digital generation comes of news-viewing age. Only a few suggested it&apos;s worth planning for the day when those conditioned to get their weather at appointed times on television die off, replaced by a generation raised on cable news, Weather.com and smartphones—who would no sooner wait for a forecast in late news than they&apos;d wait for sports scores.\nWhile stations have been paring down their on-air sports for years, they&apos;ve been keeping their weather coverage consistent, and in many cases expanding it with quick meteorologist reports in the A-block. Station managers say weather has universal appeal among viewers—something the local sports teams cannot claim. “No other story affects more people locally,” says WHEC Rochester VP/GM Arnold Klinsky.\nDespite the prodigious array of digital offerings, general managers and news directors say people still want to get the forecast from a local meteorologist they trust. A Frank N. Magid study saw 54% of news viewers 25-54 cite a station or local TV meteorologist as their most trusted source of weather information, more than triple those who said the Weather Channel (17%) or the Web (11%).\nLocal TV will need the resources, because the competition has never been tougher. In October, Verizon&apos;s pay TV service FiOS launched a WeatherBug Widget that offers customized weather reports on television. And Weather Channel picked up serious synergistic might when NBC acquired it in 2008. It gained 1.5 million unique visitors to its digital properties, such as Weather.com and a desktop widget, between September 2007 and September 2009, jumping from 34.2 million to 35.7 million. And its 4.63 billion page views this year through September are a major boost over the 3.83 billion from January to September 2007. Weather Channel also has 21 million mobile users to date.\nThe Post-Newsweek stations look to take the fight to Weather.com with JustWeather.com—which offers not only local forecasts, but wind speed, interactive radar and even a “haircast” to tell you what the conditions might do to your &apos;do. WTVT Tampa has logged some 15 million page views on its MyFoxHurricane.com microsite since June, while its Hurricane iPhone app has gotten 3,000 takers at $3.99 a pop.\nStations such as KHOU Houston marry the trusted voice of local weather knowledge and mobile media with WeatherCall automated phone calls about severe weather from the chief meteorologist; to date, more than 6,200 KHOU users have paid $6.95 for a year&apos;s worth of calls.\nWith their brands established in the market over the last half century, station managers say the fight for second- and third-screen eyeballs is theirs to lose. “It&apos;s up to us to be the place people go for weather on the Web and cellphones,” says WXIX Cincinnati VP/General Manager Bill Lanesey.\nWhile some broadcasters are optimistic that the younger generation will assume their parents&apos; viewing habits once they come of age, others say it&apos;s preposterous to think there will always be a sizable audience willing to stay up through most of the late news to get the forecast."

Bill.\nHillary Clinton is cautious, measured and Eisenhower-like in her carefully cultivated Offend-No-One manner. Her husband, on the other hand, gives me just enough room to do actual satire, not direct transcription.\nClinton’s presidency was kind of a mixed bag, what with the impeachment and all, but he did happen to be in the right place at the right time when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs hit the lottery. Generally speaking, I never lacked for amusing material from Jan. 20, 1993, until Jan. 20, 2001.\nCartoonists have little internal checklists for caricature subjects. Hair? Check? Funny expressions? Check. Gaffe propensity? Check. Whiff o’ scandal? Check. Bill has all of these, but with a twist: He has a bit of likability, unlike the GOP presidential nominee.\nBill also has a trace of human frailty and contrition. “Baby, I love you and I promise I’ll never, ever do it again.” He doesn’t blame the open mic.\nWatching Bill Clinton explain something, whether it’s something he did wrong or some arcane aspect of public policy, is truly more entertaining than anything Trump explains. Clinton, for example, can speak in complete sentences, not like a combination of cat meme and white supremacist rally.\nWe want politicians to give us straight lines so we can write the joke. We don’t want them to actually write the joke. Otherwise, we’re out of work.\nI am going to look forward to lots and lots of Bill and Hillary cartoons, mostly of Bill mansplainin’ something or the other to his wife, the president, his long fingers wildly gesticulating while she’s womanlistenin’.\nTrump?

It will be the first of 82 games for the clubs, each hoping for an improvement from a disappointing, playoff-less 2017-2018 campaign.\nThursday was a tune-up for that contest, the second-to-last preseason game for the Blackhawks and the Senators before things get real in a week. It continues to be a chance for a collection of younger players to show head coach Joel Quenneville what they’ve made of, and what they could contribute to the roster right now.\nBut once again it was a long-time veteran who registered the only tally for the Blackhawks in a 2-1 loss to Ottawa at the United Center Thursday night.\nAfter a two-goal night against the Red Wings on Tuesday, Jonathan Toews notched his third goal of the preseason just over seven minutes into the first period. Unfortunately, it was the only goal for the Blackhawks on the night, as Ottawa goalie Mike Condon stopped 28 shots to keep the home team off the scoreboard the rest of the night.\nAnton Forsberg, who got the start and played all 60 minutes in net for the Blackhawks, was up for the challenge. But he allowed a goal early in the second period to Matt Duchene; then he gave up one 2:58 into the third to Max McCormick to close out the scoring.\nIn his chance to make a case to start on opening night if Corey Crawford isn’t ready, Forsberg stopped 21-of-23 shots from the Senators in his best performance so far in the preseason.\nThere is still a lot to work out for Quenneville and his staff over the next few days, but at least NHL hockey that counts is just around the corner."

Earmarks are legislative provisions channeling federal money to a specific project, often derided as “pork-barrel’’ spending.\nRead the latest Boston Globe story here.\nBut is it smart? Probably not, and here's why.\nThe Town of Hull is trying to get more funding for renewable energy projects, and their lobbyist, the former congressman, would have to get the current congressman to go along with new earmarks or support for federal programs money.\nIt's bad enough if Delahunt is seen trying to profit form his work in Congress, but it's really bad if Delahunt is seen working against the new Congressman's reelection.\nBottom line - There is no chance that present congressman Keating will be supporting Hull's new request if former congressman Delahunt is doing the asking.\nThat means no more pork for you, Hull.\nHull's $15,000 a month stipend for Delahunt to get a few hundred thousand dollars of federal earmarks is small potatoes compared to the stakes (pun) for the Mashpee Tribe.\nThe work Delahunt is doing for the Indian tribe involves getting a mega-million dollar casino built for them in Southeastern Massachusetts.\nBy a quirk of fate, the new congressman (Keating) now represents the whole of the region in which the tribe would be allowed to build its casino.\nFederal recognition of the tribe has to go through Rep. Keating, and a casino compact has to go through Governor Patrick.

        "text": "You are here: Home / Money / Business / U.S. vs Canada vs Politics Of Trade Tariffs.\nU.S. vs Canada vs Politics Of Trade Tariffs.\n(ThyBlackMan.com) The Canadian government, lining the pockets of its dairy producers, imposes high tariffs on American dairy imports. That forces Canadians to pay higher prices for dairy products. For example, Canadians pay $5.24 for a 10.5-ounce block of cheddar. In Washington, D.C., that same amount of cheddar sells for $3.64. Canadians pay $3.99 for a 1-pound container of yogurt. In Washington, D.C., you can get nearly twice as much yogurt for a little over $4. It’s clear that the Canadian government’s tariffs screw its citizens by forcing them to pay higher prices for dairy products.\nWhat should the U.S. response be to Canada’s screwing its citizens? If you were in the Trump administration, you might propose imposing tariffs on soft wood products that Americans import from Canada — in other words, retaliate against Canada by screwing American citizens. Canadian lumber — such as that from pine, spruce and fir trees — is used in U.S. homebuilding. Guess what tariffs on Canadian lumber do to home prices. If you answered that they raise the cost and American homebuyers are forced to pay higher prices, go to the head of the class.\nThe ruse used to promote producer interests through tariff policy is concern about our large trade deficit. It’s true that we have a large current account trade deficit. However, that’s matched exactly by a very large capital account surplus. Translated, that means Americans buy more goods from other countries than they buy from us; that’s our current account deficit. But other countries find our investment climate attractive and invest more in the U.S. than we invest in other countries; that’s our capital account surplus.\nHave you ever wondered why foreigners are willing to invest far more money in Texas and California than they are willing to invest in Argentina and Venezuela? Do you think it’s because they like North Americans better than they like South Americans? No. We’ve always had an attractive investment climate, and we’ve had current account deficits and capital account surpluses throughout most of our nation’s history. In fact, the only time we had a sustained current account trade surplus was during the Great Depression, when we had a surplus in nine out of 10 years, with 1936 being the lone exception.\nLet’s delve a bit into the politics of trade tariffs. Whom do we see spending the most resources lobbying for tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum? Is it American users of steel and aluminum, such as Harley-Davidson and John Deere? Or is it United States Steel Corp. and Alcoa? Of course it’s U.S. Steel and Alcoa. They benefit from tariffs by being able to sell their products at higher prices. Harley-Davidson and John Deere lose by having to pay higher prices for their inputs, steel and aluminum, and their customers lose by having to pay higher product prices.\nThere’s a lot of nonsense talk about international trade, which some define as one country’s trading with another. When an American purchases a Mercedes, it does not represent the U.S. Congress’ trading with the German Bundestag. It represents an American citizen’s engaging in peaceable, voluntary exchange, through intermediaries, with a German auto producer. When voluntary exchange occurs, it means that both parties are better off in their own estimation — not Trump’s estimation or General Motors’ estimation. I’d like to hear the moral case for third-party interference with such an exchange."

Weighing on the oil stock was the price of crude, which plunged last month, overshadowing the company's solid third-quarter results.\nCrude prices tumbled 22% due to a complete reversal of the market's view on the oil supply picture. Instead of worrying that there might not be enough oil to meet demand as the U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran, the market is now concerned that there may be too much after the U.S. granted waivers so that most of Iran's customers could continue buying its oil. That slump in crude caused most oil stocks to sell off last month, since lower prices will impact their cash flows. In Marathon's case, it had generated $630 million in excess cash this year due to higher-than-expected oil prices, the bulk of which it used to buy back stock.\nThat slump in oil prices caused investors to quickly forget about Marathon Oil's strong third-quarter results. The company earned an adjusted $0.24 per share for the quarter, which beat the consensus estimate by $0.04 per share. Further, thanks to its strong drilling results this year, Marathon now expects to grow its production from shale by 30% to 34%, which is up from its prior range of 28% to 32%. What makes that even more impressive is that Marathon is growing at a faster pace without increasing capital spending.\nWhile the slump in oil prices will cut into Marathon's cash flow, the company remains well positioned to handle lower oil prices. That's because it built its business to thrive on $50 oil and also has a cash-rich balance sheet to help cushion the blow. That's why last month's sell-off looks like a good buying opportunity for those who are bullish on oil over the long term."

Cats know how to sleep and can sleep anywhere they want to — any table, chair, top of a shelf, window ledge, in the laundry basket, on freshly ironed clothes, the newspaper, on the edge of just about anything. There’s no doubt about it. Did you know that the only animals that can sleep more than us are the opossum and the bat?\nAs first cousins to the king of the jungle, we follow the pattern of hunters —mostly active during dawn and dusk because that is the time they could catch their prey. Such animals are c-r-e-p-u-s-c-u-l-a-r; a word longer than my tail! So our sleep pattern leaves us with plenty of time to sleep for hours during the rest of the day and night, or to break it into little naps.\nOf course, as a modern day indoor cat, one that is very well-fed and spoilt, I also sleep out of boredom, laziness and having nothing majorly exciting to do.\nSince cats in the wild must be on the alert in order to survive, we as domestic cats also follow the same pattern. Even when you think that we are deep asleep, our finely tuned senses are still active and ready to spring into action. If you watch your cat while he’s napping, you will see that his ears may rotate from time to time because he is in touch with his environment, and if he hears a noise or senses that someone is approaching, he will open his eyes to check out the situation before falling back to sleep. Try waking me up from my sleep, and I can transform from a deeply sleeping cat to a fully alert one in a matter of seconds. If I realise in the next minute that it was not really worth getting up, I can go back to sleep again.\nWhere does your cat sleep? Cuddled in the crook of your knees on your bed? On the larger part of your pillow leaving just a little space for your head? Or right against the closed door to your bedroom?\nHumans also wonder why we sleep the way we sleep. Sometimes curled up, and at other times on our backs, like humans. What happens is that when the weather is warm, we look for cool places like the floor where we can stretch out. But in cooler weather, we prefer a place bathed in warm sunshine or snuggle up to a heat source like a laptop or our human or another cat; the idea being to reduce heat loss from the body. So when we are holding our face between our paws or curling up to hide our nose and tail underneath us, it is all to do with heat conservation.\nThose of us who like to sleep at night with our humans share a cosy bond. Yes, we do get a bit annoying for you when we get up way before you and (demand a very early) breakfast or playtime, but we are a lot better than your teddy bears."

        "text": "Some hospitals may look as if they are held together with sticking plaster, but the NHS is actually a hive of new technology. Our reporters assess some of the more innovative work going on across the UK.\nLater this year, doctors in London hope to start the first human trial of a radical new treatment for children with drug-resistant leukaemia. One- or two-year-old infants will have gone through multiple rounds of chemotherapy, to no avail. The best hospitals can do is make them comfortable.\nThe therapy is one of the most sophisticated medicine has ever seen. White blood cells – part of the immune system’s frontline defences – are collected from a healthy donor and effectively turned into a drug through genetic engineering. First, they are modified to hunt down their target: a protein that appears on leukaemia blood cells. Next, they are tweaked to make them invisible to drugs that suppress the child’s immune system during the treatment. Finally, the cells are modified again to ensure that when they are infused they do not attack the child.\nIf the trial is approved and goes as planned, about 50 million modified cells will course into the arteries and veins of each sick child and destroy the leukaemia cells. The hope is to drive the cancer into deep remission within four to six weeks. The children can then have bone marrow transplants to reboot their immune systems. When bone marrow transplants are done without clearing leukaemia first, the disease has a tendency to come back. A similar procedure has already shown promise in adults.\nA medical team at Great Ormond Street hospital will run the trial for a French pharmaceutical company called Servier. But they have already had a glimpse of what the cells can do for children. Last June, a one-year-old girl, Layla Richards, became the first infant with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to have the therapy. Her cancer did not respond to several rounds of chemotherapy and she had only a few months to live.\nLayla’s medical team had some modified immune cells on ice – prepared for the trial by researcher Hong Zhan. It had taken her 18 days to modify and purify the cells in a small clean room on the hospital’s lower ground floor. The team thawed the cells out and gave them to Layla in June under a special licence granted by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Layla’s leukaemia abated and she had a bone marrow transplant three months later. So far, she is doing well.\n“This could really only have happened on the NHS, where there is a wealth of expertise and people across many disciplines willing to give their time and energy,” said Prof Waseem Qasim, leader of the clinical trial.\nAt the cutting edge of keyhole surgery on the NHS is something that looks like a tiny pen lid-sized parasol.\nFor years, doctors have operated through tiny incisions to remove appendices and gallbladders, diagnose and treat cancers, even mend or replace valves and arteries around the heart. Now, at Bristol Heart Institute, there is a trial for an even more ambitious procedure: to perform keyhole surgery in the middle of the heart.\nEvery year, nearly 3,000 people in the UK have open-heart surgery to repair or replace their mitral valve, a small oval measuring about 3-5cm across, with an elliptical opening to allow blood to flow towards the aorta and out of the heart. If the valve becomes weak, blood can leak back into the heart, triggering problems ranging from palpitations to heart failure.\nHard to reach and an unhelpful shape, opening up a patient’s chest has been the only way to solve the problem, putting it beyond the reach of hundreds of people considered too high-risk because they are frail (usually elderly) or have complicating problems such as lung disease. The Bristol unit, and two others in the UK, can now help those at-risk patients, using the parasol-shaped MitraClip, developed in the US.\nIt is inserted through the groin, into a vein going up into the “wrong” side of the heart (to avoid blocking and damaging the aortic valve). A pin punctures the heart wall, the clip is pushed through into the valve and then drawn back until it clamps the opening together in the middle. One surgeon guides the tube by hand while another watches on a screen and gives directions: “left a bit, right a bit”, as BHI consultant Mandie Townsend describes it.\nThe keyhole operation requires about double the staff in theatre for the four hours it takes, and the equipment is expensive. But patients usually recuperate on the cardiology ward and go home after two days, compared to two weeks in intensive care for those having a more common operation.\nIf the trials are successful, and the cost savings justify it, the system is likely to be offered more widely in the UK.\n“Those patients come in and out of hospital with heart failure before they are treated: we send them home on day two, in a better clinical state and hopefully with a good quality of life, which is going to stop them re-presenting,” says Townsend.\nFrom tracking a newborn’s nappy changes to fixing your car or investing in a business in Bangladesh, in most areas of life it is possible to say “there’s an app for that”.\nSoon there might be one for people living with chronic pain, which means they have had it for more than three months and medicines, physio, surgery and every other attempt by specialists have failed to solve the problem.\nDepending on the exact definition, 8-60% of people in the UK have chronic pain syndrome. For the time being, they have to learn to live with it.\nNow a new app, PainSense, is being trialled on the NHS. It was developed by Yorkshire-based company ADI, which got the idea from a specialist psychologist and a local GP.\nPatients click on the app on their phone and are offered an index of 12 areas. Two outlines of a human body – front and back – allow them to mark where the pain is, and how intense. Questionnaires ask them what impact the pain is having on their life: how well they can work, quality of sleep and their mood, for example.\nA patient using the PainSense app on their smartphone.\nBased on their score, it prompts people to use other links in the app to get advice about relaxation, pacing exercise, managing their medication and other strategies to cope with the pain.\nAs soon as the patient clicks save, the information is automatically attached to their patient record for the GP, specialist or physiotherapist to refer to at the next appointment.\nAll elements of the app have been available only on paper so far: it is the convenience of the app that is key to its success, said John Eaglesham, ADI’s chief executive. “Patients have found it’s something with them 24/7 so they can dip in and use the resources at their convenience,” he said.\nThe first trial last year was carried out by West Leeds clinical commissioning group, where, in another innovation, two patients were included in the steering group to refine the app as part of an overhaul of how it helped patients with chronic pain.\nIn those nine months, more than 1,600 people were given free access to the app. Early figures for the whole package of changes, including the app, show referrals to community pain services increased as more patients were identified, but those to specialists reduced sharply, and average costs per patient fell.\nThe CCG has now signed a contract to supply the app to at least 300 patients a month, paying the company £15 for each. Other NHS bodies in England are also now showing strong interest in the idea, said Eaglesham.\nThe London Project to Cure Blindness was set up to find a cure for one of the leading causes of sight loss in the UK.\nIt wanted to help patients with a form of age-related mascular degeneration (AMD) where damage to the part of the eye responsible for central vision – the macula – causes them to lose that area of vision. AMD is expected to seriously affect 700,000 people in the UK by the end of this decade – a scale comparable to dementia.\nLast autumn, a decade of work culminated in the first ever operation to use eye cells, grown from stem cells in a lab, to build a patch over the damaged part of the eye. Since then a second operation was carried out at Moorfields eye hospital in London, and doctors hope a third will be possible this spring. If it goes ahead, news of whether the three patients have had any of their sight restored will be made public.\nThe trial of 10 operations over 18 months is focused on “wet” AMD, where the damage is from abnormal growth of veins in the eyes and happens over a short period of time, sometimes weeks.\nIf it is successful, there are hopes that it could be used to help the much more common “dry” form of the condition, University College London’s Prof Pete Coffey, a founder of the project, told the Guardian after the first operation.\nStem cells occur naturally in embryos and adult tissues, but can also be grown in laboratories. The most common use in medicine is harvesting the cells from bone marrow of healthy adults to transplant into patients with leukaemia and lymphoma.\nOther conditions for which stem cell therapy is being developed include deafness, diabetes, infertility, HIV/Aids and baldness. A significant problem, however, is the body’s immune system attacking the foreign cells, forcing patients to take drugs suppressing their immune system for the rest of their life.\nEyes have long been considered a particularly promising area of the science because treatments there do not trigger the body’s immune defences.\nThis article was amended on 1 February 2016 to correct the spelling of the name of researcher Hong Zhan."

Furthermore, the cinematography is stunning with Spielberg's signature style in every frame. No one can deny the care Spielberg took in crafting exquisite cinema.\nAlthough the script plays like a series of inspirational monologues, for the most part, there are sharp and thought-provoking sound bites on humanity that will stay with the viewer long after they leave the theater. However, Lincoln is not a movie about Abraham Lincoln — it's about a man in an Abe costume posing as someone who had overwhelming love for African-Americans, when in reality that was far from the Abraham Lincoln documented in history. Oh, Hollywood.\nThe other piece of Lincoln: remixed and revisionist history. As a student of African-American history, I was deeply disturbed about the film's historical inaccuracies. Sure, a film can't get everything right, but the cardinal sin: Lincoln presented the end of slavery as if African-Americans idly waited and obediently prayed for rich white men to make a decision on their lives (despite a quick scene in the beginning with Black soldiers — Tony nominee Colman Domingo and British actor David Oyelowo — delicately asking Lincoln to abolish slavery). This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement. In short, Abraham Lincoln's goal was to preserve the Union — not save Black people. There is no excuse for a chunk of historical fact missing from the 150-minute film.\nLincoln is in theaters now."

Heightened political uncertainty has placed the sovereign credit rating for Pakistan under question by international rating agencies. Pakistan’s risk on the international markets has risen.\nPakistani five-year credit default swaps, used to insure against restructuring or defaulting debt, have widened by around 100 basis points to 480 basis points since the assassination, implying traders felt the country’s debt was a higher risk. Some traders believe the credit default swaps on Pakistan debt may rise to 850 basis points.\nThe question is whether the political turmoil and unrest derails the economic reform process. Pakistan’s economy has performed very well over the last few years, with strong economic growth and increased foreign investment, including much from the Gulf states.\nThe banking sector has recorded strong and increasing returns over the period. Forecast for economic growth is 7.2 per cent in the new year until June. Many foreign investors have seen Pakistan as a new breed of lesser-developed “frontier markets” offering better returns than mainstream emerging markets.\nContrary to outsiders’ opinion of the country, Pakistan has organisational structures in place that could allow the economy to continue on its growth path. However, the authorities need to ensure the country does not fall into a cycle of chaos.\nGulf financial institutions and investors have been active in Pakistan over the past few years. Dubai Islamic Bank launched an Islamic financial institution (pictured above) that has grown rapidly. There has also been a growing awareness of the benefits of Islamic banking in Pakistan.\nPakistan’s banking sector has attracted foreign interest following a series of reforms and good performances that have led to rapid expansion and increasing income for local banks. Presently only Islamic banking is able to gain new banking licences, meaning that the only way foreigners can get into the market is to buy their way in.\nSamba Financial Group, the Saudi Arabian bank, acquired a 68 per cent stake in Crescent Commercial Bank of Pakistan. Other Gulf banks active in Pakistan include Emirates Global Islamic Bank and Qatar Islamic Bank. International banks have also been attracted by the market. Standard Chartered paid $487 million (Dh1.78 billion) in cash for a 95 per cent stake in Union Bank to create the sixth-largest bank in Pakistan. The price paid was 5.6 times the net asset value. ABN Amro acquired Prime Bank of Pakistan.\nHowever, the current situation is likely to delay any immediate investment deals in Pakistan, at least until after the elections, assuming they are held. Citigroup is considering the acquisition of a Pakistani bank and wants to double its branches in a year to capitalise on rising loan demand from consumers and small companies.\nA consortium led by Bank Muscat, Oman’s largest lender, is looking at acquiring Saudi Pak Bank for around $225m. The price would be around 2.8 times Saudi Pak Bank’s current net asset value. The consortium is said not to be put off by the country’s political turmoil.\nThe potential risk in Pakistan is seen differently by Middle Eastern investors. Bank Muscat sees the move as an important part of its strategy to expand outside its home market as competition intensifies. A purchase would mark Bank Muscat’s entry into banking in the world’s sixth most populous country.\nChampions of Islamic co-operation argue Pakistan should be the GCC’s top priority, despite the turmoil. Part of the risk of the current position of Pakistan is that GCC investors may focus more on Pakistan’s neighbour, India. Nevertheless, Pakistan will remain as a target for Gulf investors due to the large size of the market and growth prospects."

        "text": "Filed to: M.I.A.Filed to: M.I.A.\nWorld Recycle Week begins April 18, and M.I.A. has teamed up with H&M for a song, “Rewear It,” advocating recycling, as well as the general specter of climate change. In the accompanying video/advert, a selection of cool people around the world are seen to be essentially waking up to the concept of recycling, jamming out as M.I.A. appeals to “regenerate the nation” in a fairly sick kaftan presumably from H&M’s Conscious Exclusive Collection.\nH&M&apos;s Cambodian Garment Workers Are Only Asking for $177 per Month: Why Can&apos;t They Get It?\nIf all [H&M] do is go and inspire another high-street brand to get in on caring and being conscious, or if H&M gets criticized for any of their factory processes, these are all good things. We should discuss them in public and we should have this back and forth. At least they’re even stepping into the [environmentally conscious] arena. Any of those things is progressive, and I think you have to give it a chance.\n...the change has to start somewhere, and I think if they can slowly get around to it, you’ve got to give them a gold star and a pat on the back, and you’ve got to be encouraging. You can’t discourage it and divide them into [labels] who make it in organic, hemp fabric are more righteous and they deserve to be represented, and all high-street brands are evil. I don’t think we should build walls like that.\nRead more of the interview at Vogue."

        "text": "“Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.” The immortal words of Confucius resonate with anyone who has ever tried to glean useful information from log data.\nThere are consensus-driven definitions of what exactly log analysis is, but a simplified, accessible explanation might be: to organize log entries into a human-friendly display and make business decisions based on what you learn.\n1GB of log data is the equivalent of nearly 700,000 pages of text. Sifting through this manually would take nearly three years, or about the same amount of time it would take to read War and Peace 571 times consecutively (debatable as to which fate is worse). And if you consider that at least a few gigs of log data are produced per day even in small organizations, well… cue the data-parsing apocalypse.\nSuffice to say, attempting to make sense of all your logs without some kind of automated assistance will lead to information overload, wasted time and serious staff demoralization.\nInvesting in a dedicated log analysis platform, be it an in-house build or 3rd-party software, should be seriously considered by the C-level powers.\nSo the solution appears simple: just find or build an automated analysis platform, right?\nJust be careful. Adoption of the wrong platform might just exacerbate the issue. Non-intuitive visualizations and statistical views can lead to hours of screen staring and head scratching.\n* Broad collection – Make sure that all the log types you need are supported, including logs that originate from different operating systems, device types, and languages.\n* Aggregation – Log entries are structured/written in a wide variety of ways, depending on their point of origin. Aggregation helps clear up this chaos by correlating similar logs together based on their shared patterns or characteristics, e.g. the action performed or users performing them. An aggregation feature should have some level of customization, such as saving logs to user-defined groups for ongoing reference.\n* Search – A useful search function goes beyond a mere text box that returns matching log data. It’s important that queries return not only search-specific data results, but also allow users to easily access the context of those results, i.e. what occurred immediately before and after in the log.\n* Alerts – A system should alert users to repeated error occurrences, system anomalies, or the absence of typical events. Make sure alert settings can be adjusted to different delivery methods, time intervals and priority levels.\nTechnologies may change dramatically from year to year, but time still equals money. Less time spent manually hunting bugs and system events leads to earlier and more rapid releases, more time for innovative feature development, and happier users. Those are the essential benefits from the DevOps perspective, but log analysis is a diverse art, and has a surprisingly broad range of uses.\nWho does it help beyond DevOps and IT?\nSecurity Engineers can exploit an Analysis platform’s search tools to find suspicious actions or breaches. The ideal platform should save search queries for repeated use, and automate the searches for a regular interval of security checks.\nCompliance – Log analysis can help keep your product in line with a range of compliance laws, and a strong automation component can speed up the process of auditing and review.\nMarketing and UX – Tools like Google Analytics and HubSpot might generally be considered irreplaceable for usage and engagement analytics. However, log analysis provides the same essential data: user traffic, referrals, usage time, click rates – they’re all in the log.\nThough some departments will be resistant to experimenting with what they perceive as a dev-only tool, the C-suite’s collective ears might perk up at the mention of paying for just one multi-purpose analytics platform. This cuts down operational costs associated with buying a litany of analytics softwares for different teams.\nThe market is flush with out-of-the-box log analysis systems, varying in levels of price, quality and versatility. Be mindful of the level of technical support offered by each, particularly if you plan to use the platform for departments without a dev background.\nFor those larger organizations that have the time, human capital and financial resources necessary to build in-house, this approach allows for made-to-measure customization for your particular industry and your business’s tech architecture. If this is your first time building in-house software, ponder this statistic during your cost-benefit analysis: the industry of data analytics enterprise software will reach nearly $200 billion in sales volume in the next two years. This is indicative of a general (though not exclusive) preference toward commercial software as opposed to in-house.\nNot everyone in your organization has prior familiarity with log analysis in and of itself, but they’re already familiar with its essential goal. In the world of big data, log analysis is merely another reflection of a universal business need today -- that is, to take mass amounts of information our technical environments generate and distill it to the essential info you need in order to constantly improve your product.\nTo learn more visit Coralogix."

        "text": "“Each season is a new story,” Lyon, France-based designer Marie Colin-Mad tells Co.Design of Milleneufcentquatrevingtquatre‘s new collection of silk square scarves, printed with intricately rendered abstract paintings. The name of the label may look like jibberish–or at least excessive–to non-French speakers, but it simply means “1984,” the birth year of the two designers, Colin-Mad and partner Amélie Charroin.\nIt’s also the year that Eric Rohmer’s “Les Nuits De La Pleine Lune” was released, the film for which the designers named their artful new collection. Some of the scarf designs channel Piet Mondrian with geometric patterns. Other silken images are dreamy and surreal: prints of floating exit signs, matches, crumpled plastic bags, and a psychedelic lightning storm.\nPart of what makes these pieces so unique is that they don’t feature repeating patterns or motifs, like many textiles, but instead, each is printed with one large, single image, which folds into an abstract jumble of colors when worn.\n“We paint and draw and photomontage by hand,” says Colin-Mad. Then the designers silkscreen their bold, original images onto 51-inch silk squares. Often modeled like modernist capes, they could just as easily be hung on a wall as colorful tapestries.\nThe collection is available in concept stores and high-end boutiques in Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, New York, Madrid, and Copenhagen, with prices starting at about $250."

It’s like a death in the family.\nShe still walks around, but that’s not our little girl, she’s that guy’s girlfriend.\nElements pointing to the possibility that your daughter is taking drugs are: Isolating herself from you, leaving her job, losing her possessions and burning through money.\nDon’t give up on her. Don’t give her money or pay her debts, but if she needs food and shelter, offer it to her. Offer her professional help.\nPeople involved in toxic relationships don’t want their family members to witness or interfere; of course she will push you away.\nYour daughter has the right to make choices – even terrible and unhealthy ones. Don’t dwell on the idea that she needs to remain your “little girl.” Do be completely transparent about your extreme concern; tell her she is worth so much more than the life she seems to be leading.\nTell her that when she is ready, you will be there for her. Keep your heart open, and don’t make this crisis about your loss, make it about her health and welfare.\nDear Amy: My husband’s mother makes a dessert that he is very fond of. Years ago she gave me the recipe and I have made it many times.\nIn the years since, my MIL has opened a restaurant. This is now one of her “signature” desserts.\nI recently wanted to make this dessert for my husband’s birthday, but couldn’t find the recipe.\nI asked my MIL for help.\nNo. She said I couldn’t have the recipe and told me I could order one from her restaurant.\nShe wants me to pay more than $60 for a pie-sized dessert.\nI am so mad about this I can’t think straight.\nShe has always been self-centered and not particularly nice, but this is pushing me almost to the breaking point; she doesn’t care about her son’s happiness, or anyone else’s.\nFor the sake of family harmony, I usually just ignore her and let my husband handle her.\nThe kicker? She didn’t even invent this recipe. The original copy was photocopied from an old cookbook.\nAm I overreacting? Do you think I’m justified in calling her out on her extreme selfishness?\nDear Upset: Your mother-in-law is being ungenerous; and yet, this seems in keeping with your assessment of her.\nAnd here’s the tough truth about people: We don’t tend to alter our behavior, even if others give us lots of chances to behave differently.\nDear Amy: You completely blew it in your answer to “Upset Coach,” who left fifth-graders in the gym (with other parents present) when an aggressive parent became confrontational.\nYou agreed with the school’s choice to reprimand this coach for leaving the gym. I completely disagree.\nCoach diffused the situation by leaving; he or she kept them safe.\nDear Parent: This coach was responsible for the children’s safety while they were in the gym. Leaving them with a belligerent parent who is yelling at them does not assure their safety – even if there are other adults present."

        "text": "A woman who fell in love with a puppy whose photo she saw online was left “empty-handed and broken-hearted” after a pet-shipping company kept her money but never sent the purchased pug.\nThe situation has prompted the Better Business Bureau in Albuquerque to issue an alert about the company – Mail Pet Express Travel Agency – which says it’s located in Santa Fe. The address it uses is actually “a million-dollar mansion that is listed for sale … and has no connection to a business breeding, selling and/or offering to ship puppies,” the BBB says.\nThe local BBB was unable to verify the company’s location, but its website – which has no content but takes you to a general search page – is registered in Yaounde, Cameroon. The Journal also was unable to locate the company.\nIn addition, it does not have a required license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ship animals, the BBB said.\nThe broken-hearted woman contacted the supposed breeder after seeing pictures of the puppy. She was then contacted by the company and paid it $500 via Money Gram.\nSoon after, she received an email saying she had to pay an additional $1,520 fee because weather conditions meant the puppy would have to be shipped in an electrified crate, the alert said. That’s when she contacted the BBB.\nIf you are thinking of using an animal shipping service, you can check the shipper’s licensing with the U.S. Department of Agriculture at aphis.usda.gov/ or by calling 844-820-2234.\nIf you get a phone call saying your lottery ticket is a winner, you are likely the target of a scam. Especially if you didn’t buy a lottery ticket.\nThe New Mexico Lottery says the most common kind of scam it sees is this: A caller, most often someone sounding like they’re from a foreign country, tells you that you have won the lottery.\nThey say, for example, if you send them $5,000 in “earnest money,” they’ll send you your $100 million winnings, explains Vince Torrez, New Mexico Lottery executive vice president for security. The scam can happen by phone or email, and sometimes they’ll even use the state lottery’s logo, he says.\nThe lottery does not call make any kind of initial call to people, informing them they have won. In fact, it works in the opposite way. You must notify the lottery if you have the winning numbers. (You can find out what those are from the lottery website or hotline, local media or some retailers.) You must produce your ticket, which will go through a validation process before you are awarded any prizes.\nThis might seem obvious, but – you can’t win if you didn’t play. Even though it’s tempting to believe that you won something, it’s just not possible if you didn’t enter.\nBuy lottery tickets only from authorized New Mexico Lottery retailers.\nNever give your credit card numbers to anyone promising lottery cash prizes or memberships.\nNever respond or send money to someone who offers you a guarantee of winning a prize. The New Mexico Lottery does not guarantee you a prize, only a chance of winning one if you buy a legal ticket from an authorized retailer."

        "text": "SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Education (MOE) confirmed on Friday that the holding site for the new junior college (JC) will remain at Mount Sinai, after it reassessed other options based on feedback from parents.\nThis is because the Mount Sinai site, where the former Raffles JC used to be, has the space and facilities to complement a JC-level education, which other holding sites lack, the ministry said.\nThe new JC will start in 2017 and enrol mainly Integrated Programme students from Catholic High School (CHS) in Bishan, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School in Ang Mo Kio and the Singapore Chinese Girls' School (SCGS) in Bukit Timah.\nThe plan is for them to study at an interim site until the campus at the junction of Sin Ming Avenue and Marymount Road is ready at end-2019. The original choice of an interim school site in Bishan became unavailable and a new site had to be picked.\nAffected parents and students were informed of the decision on Friday evening, in a letter signed by director of finance and development division Wong Kang Jet, and director of school planning and placement division Lim Huay Chih.\nIn the four-page letter, MOE said some parents had suggested the former Institute of Technical Education (ITE) campus at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 as a possible holding site at a dialogue session last Monday, as it is nearer to their children's current schools.\n\"Hence, during the Q&A session, despite our assessment that Mount Sinai site is the best possible holding site for the new JC, we agreed, at the request of these parents, to re-examine the feasibility of available sites nearer to the original holding site, with a specific focus on the former ITE AMK (Ang Mo Kio) site,\" the ministry wrote.\nThe ministry added that it had \"studied in greater detail\" how it could enhance the Ang Mo Kio site. It also considered aspects of the JC programme that had to be scaled down, as the Ang Mo Kio site is smaller than the Mount Sinai one.\n\"Our assessment continues to be that the former ITE AMK (Ang Mo Kio) site is not as suitable for the new JC as compared to the Mount Sinai site, as it will not be able to support the programmes and provide all the students with sufficient facilities for a positive JC learning experience,\" it said.\nThe ministry had decided on Mount Sinai as the interim site for the JC after the original plan of having the temporary campus at the former ITE Bishan campus at Bishan Street 14 fell through.\nThe change in the interim location had upset some parents, who felt Mount Sinai was too far, and their children would spend too much time travelling.\nThe permanent campus will be ready by end-2019, a delay from its original timeline of mid-2018, due to the construction of the Cross-Island Line."

Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) novel \"Jin Ping Mei\" tops the literature category on the platform, having been listened over 40 million times.\nOther classics such as the collection of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig, and \"Border Town\" written by reputed Chinese writer Shen Congwen, are also among eight books with over 10 million listens in the category.\nFor Shen Dayuan, vice general manager of CITIC United Cloud Technology, a content-oriented Internet company set up by CITIC Press Group, the combination of stories and audio is key to the revival of classic works on the platform.\n\"Performing the stories with voices is a whole different way of expression and another art form,\" he said, drawing an analogy between audio novels and the still popular traditional art forms of cross-talk and sketches. \"It's got an attraction of its own.\"\n\"Our best-selling audiobook is'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,' as we invited Luo Xin, a famous TV host in Shanghai, to record the audio,\" he said. \"As the book is already a bestseller in other forms, it should be no surprise that the market reacted so positively.\"\nWu believes audiobooks help people make the most of brief time fragments and meets demand for saving time, given the frantic pace of modern life.\n\"Similar to what it did for books, the industrial chain of audiobooks can in turn provide more possibilities for the traditional publishing business,\" she said. \"The market potential is immeasurable.\"\nFor instance, Ximalaya FM asks customers to vote for books they want to listen to, and the platform arranges recordings and productions of the most popular choices.\nAudiobooks in China have enjoyed an upsurge in recent years. According to a report published in April by iiMedia Research, another Chinese think tank, the total market value of audiobooks in China rose from 2.37 billion yuan in 2016 to 3.24 billion last year, and is expected to reach 7.83 billion yuan by 2020.\nFor e-book dealers, with the debate over whether e-books will ever replace printed books cooling, they are already looking for ways to take advantage of the evolving market and guide their customers.\n\"Take'The Qin Empire' as an example,\" Shen said as he spoke of the six-book historical novel series based on China's Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.), first published in 2008. \"We priced it at 199 yuan upon the release of the e-book two years ago, which most readers found unacceptable.\"\n\"So we changed our strategy into pricing it at five cents per thousand words, which literally would cost no less than the original if one finished the series.\"\nA year later, the series became CITIC Press Group's best-selling e-book of 2017 on iReader, a major reading platform for e-books, enjoying a new life almost 1O years after being published.\nThe example reflects not only the potential in e-books as a more convenient reading method, but also a coming-of-age for the consumption habits of Chinese customers.\nAccording to the iiMedia report, the number of Chinese who paid for online content doubled from 93 million in 2016 to 190 million in 2017, and is expected to grow by a similar margin to reach 296 million by the end of this year.\nThe trend is benefiting the audiobook business, and driving its insiders to change their strategies.\nApart from the aforementioned crowd-sourcing approach, Ximalaya FM is already allowing users to give'hosts' of audiobooks rewards, much like what they can on popular live-streaming platforms.\nMoreover, they are looking to spend 3 billion yuan to support audio producers in every aspect. \"We'll try to enable every possible way for good hosts to profit from their work, such as by providing subsidies and signing bonuses and others,\" Wu Ting said.\nA \"well-off,\" \"motivated\" and \"knowledgeable\" man spent over 13,411 yuan in the 1st half of the year on Ximalaya FM with favorite books."

        "text": "ALEPPO, Syria/BEIRUT/GENEVA (Reuters) - Rebel resistance in the Syrian city of Aleppo ended on Tuesday after years of fighting and months of bitter siege and bombardment that culminated in a bloody retreat, as insurgents agreed to withdraw in a ceasefire.\nThe battle of Aleppo, one of the worst of a civil war that has drawn in global and regional powers, has ended with victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his military coalition of Russia, Iran and regional Shi’ite militias.\nFor rebels, their expected departure with light weapons starting on Wednesday morning for opposition-held regions west of the city is a crushing blow to their hopes of ousting Assad after revolting against him during the 2011 Arab uprisings.\nHowever, the war will still be far from over, with insurgents retaining major strongholds elsewhere in Syria, and the jihadist Islamic State group holding swathes of the east and recapturing the ancient city of Palmyra this week.\nRebel officials said fighting would end on Tuesday night and a source in the pro-Assad military alliance said the evacuation of fighters would begin at around dawn on Wednesday. A Reuters reporter in Aleppo said late on Tuesday that the booms of the bombardment could no longer be heard.\nFighters and their families, along with civilians who have thrown in their lot with the rebels, will have until Wednesday evening to quit the city, a Turkish government source said. The ceasefire was negotiated by Turkey and Russia, without U.S. involvement.\nA commander with the Jabha Shamiya rebel group said that Aleppo was a moral victory for the insurgents. “We were steadfast.... but unfortunately nobody stood with us at all”, the commander, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.\nThe plight of civilians has caused global outrage in the wake of a sudden series of advances by the Syrian army and its allies across the rebel enclave over the past two weeks.\n“We appear to be witnessing nothing less than.... a total uncompromising military victory,” U.N. Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.\nThe rout of rebels from their ever-shrinking territory in Aleppo sparked a mass flight of terrified civilians and insurgents in bitter weather, a crisis the United Nations said was a “complete meltdown of humanity”. There were food and water shortages in rebel areas with all hospitals closed.\nThe United Nations earlier on Tuesday voiced deep concern about reports it had received of Syrian soldiers and allied Iraqi fighters summarily shooting dead 82 people in recaptured east Aleppo districts. It accused them of “slaughter”.\n“They have gone from siege to slaughter,” British U.N. ambassador Matthew Rycroft said. “Aleppo will join the ranks of those events in world history that define modern evil, that stain our conscience decades later - Halabja, Rwanda, Srebrenica and now Aleppo,” said U.S. ambassador Samantha Power.\nThe Syrian army has denied carrying out killings or torture among those captured, and its main ally Russia said on Tuesday rebels had “kept over 100,000 people in east Aleppo as human shields”.\nAn official with an Aleppo rebel group said the bulk of about 50,000 people was expected to be evacuated.\nFear stalked the city’s streets. Some survivors trudged in the rain past dead bodies to the government-held west or the few districts still in rebel hands. Others stayed in their homes and awaited the Syrian army’s arrival.\nFor all of them, fear of arrest, conscription or summary execution added to the daily terror of bombardment. “People are saying the troops have lists of families of fighters and are asking them if they had sons with the terrorists. (They are) then either left or shot and left to die,” said Abu Malek al-Shamali in Seif al-Dawla, one of the last rebel-held districts.\nA Syrian military source said the evacuation of fighters would start at 5 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday. The source said fighters’ families would also leave, but did not mention other civilian evacuations.\nBehind those fleeing was a wasteland of flattened buildings, concrete rubble and bullet-pocked walls, where tens of thousands had lived until recent days under intense bombardment even after medical and rescue services had collapsed.\nThe once-flourishing economic center with its renowned ancient sites has been pulverized during the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, created the world’s worst refugee crisis and allowed for the rise of Islamic State.\nThe U.N.’s Colville said the rebel-held area had become “a hellish corner” of less than a square kilometer. Its capture was imminent, he added.\nThe Syrian army and its allies could declare victory at any moment, a Syrian military source had said earlier, predicting the final fall of the rebel enclave on Tuesday or Wednesday, after insurgent defenses collapsed on Monday.\nTerrible conditions were described by city residents.\nAbu Malek al-Shamali, a resident in the rebel area, said dead bodies lay in the streets. “There are many corpses in Fardous and Bustan al-Qasr with no one to bury them,” he said.\n“Last night people slept in the streets and in buildings where every flat has several families crowded in,” he added.\nState television broadcast footage of a tide of hundreds of refugees walking along a ravaged street, wearing thick clothes against the rain and cold, many with hoods or hats pulled tight around their faces, and hauling sacks or bags of belongings.\nOne man pushed a bicycle loaded with bags, another family pulled a cart on which sat an elderly woman. Another man carried on his back a small girl wearing a pink hat.\nAt the same time, a correspondent from a pro-Damascus television station spoke to camera from a part of Aleppo held by the government, standing in a tidy street with flowing traffic.\nIn some recaptured areas, people were returning to their shattered homes. A woman in her sixties, who identified herself as Umm Ali, or “Ali’s mother”, said that she, her husband and her disabled daughter had no water.\nThey were looking after the orphaned children of another daughter killed in the bombing, she said, and were reduced to putting pots and pans in the street to collect rainwater.\nIn another building near al-Shaar district, which was taken by the army last week, a man was fixing the balcony of his house with his children. “No matter the circumstances, our home is better than displacement,” he said.\n“The crushing of Aleppo, the immeasurably terrifying toll on its people, the bloodshed, the wanton slaughter of men, women and children, the destruction – and we are nowhere near the end of this cruel conflict,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said in a statement."

UNLV won 38-35.\nPete Thomas was so overcome with emotion he could barely speak to friends and family, much less assembled media after his team’s loss to UNLV. The sophomore CSU quarterback, as his teammates, had put so much stock into coming out with a victory that not getting the job done was, yes, a crying shame.\nAnd now, with four games left in a season that has taken a turn no one wanted it to take, some players officially need convincing to stay on board with the program. The locker room is slowly disintegrating along with the season and team leaders pledge to scramble to piece it back together.\nColorado State has a bye this week and the general consensus is the time off will be good for everyone involved. As the faction of fans against retaining coach Steve Fairchild grows, the coaching staff will hit the road this week to recruit. To date, CSU has one official commitment — outside linebacker Deonte Wortham from Dallas.\nPractices will be held midweek, and end for CSU to break for the weekend. The Rams insist more tinkering can be done to turn things around, but they have already tried lineup changes, practice changes, getting back to fundamentals and scheme adjustments as a means to get out of the fog. A multitude of injuries has been detrimental to the team, however.\n“I feel like we still got some things that we can bring out,” safety Austin Gray said. “It’s a test of true character if you can bounce back.\nDefensively, CSU has fallen apart. Injuries have taken their toll with losses of mainstays such as linebacker Myke Sisson, cornerback Elijah-Blu Smith and defensive end Broderick Sargent. The suspension of safety Ivory Herd didn’t help, either. Still, things started to significantly slide right after the Utah State game on Sept. 24.\nThree of CSU’s last four games are at home — Nov. 12 vs. San Diego State, Nov. 26 vs. Air Force and Dec. 3 vs. the MWC’s biggest surprise, Wyoming. There is a road contest on Nov. 19 at TCU. Given how the team is played, getting three wins in that group might seem like a long shot for the 3-5 Rams.\nStill, everyone is staying on message."

        "text": "Clinical psychologist Angela Redlak talks with a patient at Renfrew Center Foundation in Charlotte, N.C.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — Kelly had an epiphany in her car two years ago on a lunch break.\nShe thought about the lifestyles of other people in their early 30s, her age. They went out. They had kids. They led full lives. When she thought about her own life, she burst into tears. Her life revolved around her bingeing schedule.\nKelly's plan that day: Go home after work at 2:30, binge and purge until her husband got home. Dinner with him. Binge and purge again.\nThe eating disorder she had since she was 15 years old could kill her.\nShe was the only one who could stop it.\nEating disorders among women age 30 and older in the United States are increasing. Some women, like Kelly of Charlotte, N.C., have suffered from an eating disorder most of their lives. For others, there's a trigger, like a divorce or a parent's death. Many feel overwhelmed by aging and the pressure to look young.\nThe medical complications of eating disorders tend to worsen as women age, says Angela Redlak, a clinical psychologist at the Renfrew Center Foundation in Charlotte, where Kelly is treated. They are more prone to develop osteoporosis, dental erosion, heart disease and arthritis.\nThe chronic pain of these conditions causes many middle-aged women — unlike teenagers and women in their 20s — to acknowledge they have an eating disorder and seek help.\nGrowing up in upstate New York, Kelly says she was always about 40 pounds overweight. Her mom told her she would buy her clothes if she lost weight.\nWhen Kelly started to like boys, she noticed they weren't attracted to overweight girls. She was 15 when she read a magazine article about anorexia and bulimia and decided that would be the easiest way to get thin.\nAs soon as school let out for summer break after Kelly's sophomore year, she started dieting. When she went back to school in the fall, she'd lost 35 pounds. She weighed 123 pounds, a normal weight for her 5-foot, 5-inch, small-boned frame. In six months later, her weight had dropped to 95 pounds.\nDuring treatment for anorexia, she met some girls with bulimia, so she started binging and purging, too.\nWhen people told her she looked too skinny, she felt emboldened to get even skinnier. Then Kelly's two best girlfriends walked away from her. Boys made vomiting noises when she passed by in the school hall.\nEventually the message got through and she gained weight. When her longtime boyfriend died in an ATV accident, Kelly turned to drugs, then alcohol. She stopped eating.\nIn a new relationship she tried hiding her disorder, but every once in a while he suspected something. She would tell him to mind his own business.\n\"I was sick of that life,\" she said. \"It was having no life.\"\nStill, they married and moved to Charlotte three years ago. But Kelly's eating disorder moved with her.\nA while after Kelly's lunch-break epiphany, she contacted the Renfrew Center in south Charlotte.\n\"Eating disorders are very deceptive by nature,\" says Redlak, Renfrew's clinical supervisor. To help pull women out of their disorder, Renfrew uses traditional talk therapy, group therapy, couples and family therapy.\nWhen Kelly started going to group therapy, she was with younger girls.\n\"I was like,'Look at what happens. Do you want it to follow you?' \" she said. \"It held me back from doing many things.\"\nWhen Kelly was in her 20s, she wanted to be a state trooper. Looking back, she thinks she would have pursued a career had she not suffered from an eating disorder. Now she works at a delivery company.\nAfter a year of therapy, Kelly says she is finally discovering who she is.\n\"I realize I'm worth more than what I was doing to myself,\" she said.\nIt is common for women age 30 and older to take responsibility for their disorder, says Redlak. Between 20 and 30 percent of Redlak's patients are over 30, and the number is growing.\nThe trend seems to be true across the country, says Cynthia Bulik, director of the eating disorders program at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Fifty percent of her patients are older than 30, and that number is rising, she says.\nBulik says societal pressure for lifelong thinness is prompting many women to develop the disorders later in life. It usually has a devastating effect on their families.\nWomen who are 30 and older are often more motivated than adolescents to get help, Redlak says.\nBut they don't necessarily have better outcomes, especially if they've had an eating disorder for many years.\nWhen Kelly was 15, she was dismissed by her dietitian and heard her doctor blame her mother for her eating disorder.\nKelly doesn't blame anyone anymore. She focuses on getting better."

        "text": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficiently for satisfactory sexual performance. Aging is a major factor responsible for impeding the normal function of erection. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injuries, and hypertension, medications are some factors that have been found to cause erectile dysfunction. The first line of treatment for ED comprises oral medication of PDE5 inhibitors. The global erectile dysfunction drugs market was valued at US$ 4.35 Bn in 2016 and is projected to reach US$ 2.87 Bn by 2026, declining at a CAGR of 3.2% from 2018 to 2026. The market observed significant changes in 2018 mainly due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. of key revenue generating brands Viagra (sildenafil citrate), and is also expected to face a setback in the future due to loss of patent exclusivities of other recognized brands namely, Cialis (tadalfil) and Levitra/Staxyn (vardenafil).\nMale sexual function stridently declines after the age of 50 years along with increasing incidence of erectile dysfunction. Increase in susceptibility of geriatric population to erectile dysfunction increases demand for drugs to treat this abnormality. Moreover, psychological and physical changes, including hormonal alteration, can decrease libido and add to the cause of erectile dysfunction. According to a study conducted by New England Research Institutes in 2000, the worldwide prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 152 million in 1995. It is expected to increase to 322 million in 2025. Most of these cases are likely to occur in developing countries due to rise in geriatric aging population. Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are commonly used erectile dysfunction drugs across the globe. Viagra (sildenafil citrate) and other PDE 5 inhibitors such as Cialis (tadalafil) and Levitra/Staxyn (vardenafil) are extensively consumed for ED treatment worldwide.\nLoss of patent exclusivity of a branded drug results in revenue reduction by nearly 40% in the first year, which goes on decreasing to 30% and 20% in the following years. This is attributed to the launch of generic equivalents of these drugs being manufactured and marketed at 1/10th of the price of the original branded drug, thus resulting in higher consumption of generic drugs due to high efficacy and demand. Consequently, the generics segment is anticipated to be a promising area of investment even for original molecule manufacturers, as it is a mode of sustenance and offsetting expenditures of the companies.\nThe global erectile dysfunction drugs market is segmented based on drug, distribution channel, and geography. In terms of drug, the erectile dysfunction drugs market is divided into Viagra, Cialis, Staxyn/Levitra, Stendra/Spedra, and others. The others drug class includes Zydena (medicated urethral system for erection), Mvix, Helleva, Vitaros, Caverject Impulse, generic products, and pipeline products. Cialis (tadalafil) sales exceeded that of Viagra (sildenafil citrate) due to patent expiration of Viagra (sildenafil citrate) in major countries in Europe. Patent expiry of Cialis (tadalafil) in 2017 is expected to drastically affect the market, considering the global sales of the drug was US$ 2.3 Bn in 2017.\nGeographically, the erectile dysfunction drugs market has been categorized into five regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa. North America accounted for the largest share of the global erectile dysfunction drugs market in 2016, followed by Europe. High awareness, increase in funding for research and grants, favorable medical reimbursement policies, high prevalence of erectile dysfunction, rapidly growing geriatric population, and promising clinical pipeline products drive the erectile dysfunction drugs market in North America. Middle East & Africa is an attractive market. The market in this region is expected to expand at a significant CAGR during the forecast period. The erectile dysfunction drugs market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to expand at a moderate growth rate. Japan and China account for major share of the erectile dysfunction drugs market in Asia Pacific, primarily due to large geriatric people affected with erectile dysfunction in these countries.\nThe global erectile dysfunction drugs market is consolidated with a few companies accounting for major share. Key players operating in the global erectile dysfunction drugs market include Pfizer, Inc., Dong-A ST Co., Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, Bayer AG, VIVUS, INC., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Manufacturers are launching new products in the international market to tap the unmet needs of erectile dysfunction. Other prominent players operating in the global market include SK chemicals, Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cristalia Produtos Quimicos Farmaceuticos Ltda. Apricus Biosciences, Inc., and Futura Medical plc."

These women spend most of their days being a good wife and mother, so hurt feelings are completely understandable if others don't take the holiday seriously.\nSo, what do wives and mothers do when it's obvious their families don't care that much? They cheat the next day.\nAccording to Ashley Madison's reports, last year, their numbers of sign-ups spiked by 442 percent after the holiday, all thanks to women searching online to have an affair.

In this White House ceremony, President Obama noted it took more than four decades to bring the organizer of the murders, Edgar Ray Killen, to justice.\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: On June 21st, 1964, three young men—two white and one black—set out to learn more about the burning of a church in Neshoba County, Mississippi: James Earl Chaney, 21 years old; Andrew Goodman, 20 years old; Michael Henry Schwerner, 24 years old—young men. And in that Freedom Summer, these three Americans refused to sit on the sidelines. Their brutal murder by a gang of Ku Klux Klan members shook the conscience of our nation. It took 44 days to find their bodies, 41 years to bring the lead perpetrator to justice.\nAnd while they’re often remembered for how they died, we honor them today for how they lived—with the idealism and the courage of youth. James, Andrew and Michael could not have known the impact they would have on the civil rights movement or on future generations. And here today, inspired by their sacrifice, we continue to fight for the ideals of equality and justice for which they gave their lives. Today we are honored to be joined by James’s daughter Angela, Andrew’s brother David, and Michaels wife Rita.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor. We turn now to excerpts of a documentary titled Neshoba: The Price of Freedom, which tells the story of the three civil rights activists.\nNEWS ANCHOR: First, the known facts. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner went to Mississippi to help register Negroes as voters. Chaney, a 20-year-old Mississippian, was a veteran of the civil rights movement in his home state. He assisted in the training classes. Goodman, 20, a New York college student, had never participated in the civil rights movement, but a friend says Goodman could never understand how some people could be so lacking in compassion. Schwerner, 24, a seasoned New York social worker, left Mississippi where he had worked since January, to assist in the training school at Oxford, Ohio.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: The film, Neshoba, goes on to document the role local Mississippi law enforcement agents and the Ku Klux Klan played in the murder of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.\nNEWS ANCHOR: It’s 35 miles from Meridian to Philadelphia, then 12 miles to Longdale, where the church had been burned. That afternoon, the three were seen at the church site and at the home of its lay leader. About 2:30 they headed west toward Philadelphia.\nAMY GOODMAN: An excerpt from the documentary, Neshoba: The Price of Freedom. President Obama has just awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the three civil rights activists posthumously, murdered by the Klan 50 years ago, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Mickey Schwerner. That excerpt includes comments from U.S. Justice Department Attorney John Doar, who died earlier this month at the age of 92. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.\nThis is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.

        "text": "This clears the way for debt agencies to charge higher fees on overdue loans.\nAccording to a Tuesday analysis from the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans have fallen behind on their student loans. The data, obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, reveals 42.4 million people in the U.S. owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans by the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average amount owed per borrower increased by 17 percent.\nBack in 2015, the Obama administration issued a memo that prevented debt collectors from charging high interest rates on overdue student loans. So long as the borrower entered the government’s loan-rehabilitation program within 60 days of defaulting, agencies of the old, bank-based Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) were forbidden from charging up to 16 percent of personal and accrued interest. Still, some lawmakers argue that debt collectors continue to impose these fees, despite the Obama regulations.\nAs part of an ongoing legal case, the U.S. District Court gave the Trump administration until March 16 to decide whether to uphold the Obama-era guidelines.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Suzanne Bonamici, both Democrats, penned a letter Monday asking Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to uphold the previous memo. “We urge the [Department of Education] to stand by its previous guidance and give borrowers in default a chance to rehabilitate their loans and successfully repay their debt without being charged massive collection fees,” the letter reads.\nThis request was short-lived. The Department of Education revoked the Obama guidelines on Thursday and instructed guarantee agencies (companies that issue government-backed student loans) to collect on defaulted debt.\nAs MarketWatch points out, a relatively small share of borrowers will be impacted by the new regulations. Starting in 2010, all new federal student loans were issued by the Department of Education, which doesn’t charge collection fees to borrowers who quickly agree to make good on their defaults. As a result, students who have taken out federal loans in the last few years need not worry about an increase in fees.\nBut those who received loans from the FFELP—which discontinued new loans in 2010—have cause for concern. The Washington Post reports that nearly half of America’s outstanding debt in default comes from this bank-based federal lending program, while Tuesday’s CFA analysis finds that 16 million Americans are liable for bank-based federal student loans.\nOne of the main criticisms from the Trump administration, as stated Thursday in a “dear colleague” letter, was that the Obama memo lacked public input. Only time will tell what the public has to say about the new administration guidelines."

It’s harvest season, and for some, transporting cane across the Mississippi River is costing them more than they anticipated.\nSt. James sugarcane farmer and president of the East St. James Parish Farm Bureau Pete Dufresne enjoys tending to his 2,600-acre crop just off the river. In the fall, the combines, tractors, and trucks are rolling out the year’s finest.\n“It’s harvest time, and this is where we make it. This is our whole year,” Dufresne said.\nBut Dufresne is concerned about his profit this time around, and the weather has very little to do with it. His land is just off the Sunshine Bridge. Harvest season began on October 3, just nine days before a barge carrying a crane rammed into the bridge, damaging a major support beam. The bridge has been closed since for repairs and it’s not expected to be back open until January, the end of harvest season.\n“It’s going to affect the profit margin because, unfortunately, our sugar is sold at predetermined prices. We can’t just increase the price of sugar to overcome the additional expenses,” Dufresne said.\nThose additional expenses, Dufresne says, comes from the five extra trucks he has had to hire to haul his quota of cane to the mill each day. He says what used to be an 18-mile trip across the river is now approximately 50. The longer hours and extra fuel are adding up. “A truck used to complete a trip in one hour and now it takes three hours,” Dufresne said.\nAll that extra time is money Dufresne says he can’t get back. The sight of the Sunshine Bridge under repair for the remainder of the season, Dufresne finds hard to stomach. “Surely it was a completely avoidable incident. That’s the most frustrating part about it. To me, it wasn’t an accident, it was avoidable,” Dufresne said.\nDufresne says so far, the closure has tripled his harvesting expenses."

The car will be available in four variants with a price tag ranging between Rs 3.19 lakh and Rs 4.02 lakh (ex-showroom in the Capital). The new Zen is expected to take on Hyundai Santro and Tata Indica.\nThe new Zen will be available in eight colours. Zen Estilo will be available to the customers for Rs 3,19,403, while Zen Estilo Lxi is will cost Rs 3,48,403, Similarly, Zen Estilo will carry a price tag of Rs 3,734,03 and Zen Estilo Vxi ABS has been priced at Rs 4,02,403.\nMaruti had in March this year discontinued'Zen' in its earlier avatar. The first generation Zen was launched in 1993 and the company had sold 7.60 lakh Zen models until March this year, including the export of 1.22 lakh units. At the time of discontinuation of production, Maruti was selling nearly 4,000 units of Zen every month in the domestic market.\nZen Estilo is roomier than the original'Zen' and has a 1,061 cc engine. It delivers 64 bhp, thereby making it an ideal vehicle for Indian city conditions, Maruti officials say.\nExplaining the company’s strategy for launching this car, Maruti managing director Jagdish Khattar said, \"Young people in India today desire products with contemporary styling and international appeal. The new Zen will appeal to this new India, just as the original Zen appealed to the India of mid-1990s. It incorporates features and attributes that are uniquely suited to India and valued by Indian car buyers.\"\nThe compact car A-2 segment has posted 27.5 per cent growth between April and October this year with 4.08 lakh units being sold compared with 3.2 lakh units in the corresponding period last year. As a result, the share of the A-2 segment cars to total sales rose to 63.70 per cent as against 60.60 per cent last year.\nHowever, Maruti grew at a rate less than the industry average as it had discontinued the production of the first generation'Zen'.\nMaruti sold 2,30,137 units during April-October this year, a growth of 23.5 per cent from 1,86,035 units in the same period last year. Maruti’s market share in the A-2 segment in the seven months of the financial year is 56.4 per cent."

Indie filmmaker Denise Ohio restores a bit of the word’s luster with this surprisingly compelling portrait of Frank Minden. Who? An ordinary, hard-working man, a WWII vet and master diesel machinist, the 76-year-old Minden has never signed a multimillion-dollar contract with a sports franchise or refused an Oscar in honor of the worthy cause of the day. But in the short space of thirty minutes, Ohio illustrates what makes this St. Louis man so admired and respected by those around him. Interviews with Minden’s wife and seven adult children reveal the kind of family anecdotes and obviously oft-told tales that shouldn’t be of interest to anyone not Minden, but the sincere adoration of his family lends a potency to them, perhaps by reminding us of our own familial bonds… or highlighting a lack thereof. Reticent and staid, Minden doesn’t have much to say for himself, but Ohio’s artfully simple footage of him at work in his shop says more about the stolid nobility of this ordinary man than words ever could. Shot partially in digital form and edited digitally, Family Business is a lovingly produced family album, a high-tech movie about a decidedly low-tech hero… yes, hero."

Two of those projects involve a $7.9 million clinical trial testing an insulin nasal spray for treating the disease and a $16 million study that is the first prevention trial in people at the highest risk for Alzheimer’s disease.\nThere is also increased funding for improving high-quality training for physicians and a media campaign to be launched this summer.\nFor patients needing support now, the Health and Human Services (HHS) department has a new website with extensive resources for Alzheimer’s patients and their families.\nPrevent and effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease by 2025: The Obama Administration has already invested $50 million in new Alzheimer’s disease research funding for this year and $80 million in research for 2013. “These investments will open new opportunities in Alzheimer’s disease research and jumpstart efforts to reach the 2025 goal,” the authors write.\nOptimize care quality and efficiency: To better educate Alzheimer’s caregivers and physicians, the administration announced a $6 million investment over two years for provider education and outreach.\nExpand support for people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families: “Supporting people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families and caregivers requires giving them the tools that they need, helping to plan for future needs, and ensuring that safety and dignity are maintained,” the report says. The announcement proposes an investment of $10.5 million for 2013 to support the needs of caregivers.\nEnhance public awareness and engagement: The report says 85% of people surveyed can identify Alzheimer’s disease and its symptoms, but misperceptions can lead to delayed diagnoses and stigmas. The administration is investing $8.2 million over two years, starting this year, to support public awareness initiatives.\nTrack progress and drive improvement: The administration proposes to invest $1.3 million in 2013 for data collection improvement and increased understanding of the disease’s impact on people with the disease, their families and the health care system."

Castleton Lyons, which is just down the road from the Kentucky Horse Park, is making beds available for members of the Irish team who will be competing at the Games.\nAnd the endurance competition taking place on Sept. 26 would have been impossible if it were not for nearby farms like Mt. Brilliant, Cobra Farm and Kentuckiana Farm allowing the 100-mile event to go through their farms. Cobra and Kentuckiana are each hosting small private parties during the endurance event.\n\"You know, I really don't know that there is that much of a gap between the Thoroughbred people and the sport-horse people because so many of the Thoroughbred people are involved in event horses or dressage or hunter/jumpers,\" said Mike Owens, manager of Cobra Farm, which is also hosting opera singer Denyce Graves, who will sing at the Games' opening ceremonies.\nThe efforts the farms are making come at one of the busiest times of the year in the Thoroughbred industry. The Keeneland September yearling sale runs from Sept. 12 through Sept. 26. And the Keeneland race meet begins Oct. 8 and leads into the Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5 and 6.\n\"Just because the Games are going on, you can't change the schedule of the farm or the stallions,\" said Michael Hernon, director of sales for Gainesway Farm. \"It is a busy time, and then it's a balancing act in a way. You want to try to accommodate people, but you also don't want people randomly showing up.\"\nThe Seattle Slew statue stands in the middle of the stallion complex at Three Chimneys Farm near Midway.

        "text": "In a speech at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, delivered January 19 2018, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis announced the nation’s latest National Defense Strategy, The first in ten years, Secretary Mattis indicated that the thrust of the nation’s policy had shifted away from fighting terrorism toward countering the threat posed by Russia and China.\nMost maliciously, authorities invariably deflect criticism of U.S. policy by attempting to link dissenting publications with Russia.\nGiven that the U.S. appears to be just as self-serving and law defying as Russia is accused of being, what is the reality behind the unrelenting anti-Russian propaganda campaign? That question is at the heart of this week’s installment of the Global Research News Hour.\nIn the first half hour, past guest Dmitry Orlov returns to the show to bring us up to speed on some of the latest developments. The Russian-American commentator addresses some of the actions in recent months including the Skripal affair and the stand-off with Israel over the shooting down of a Russian plane. He compares and contrasts the two countries’ military postures and their differing objectives. He also examines the impacts of the sanctions regime and its implications for international political and economic relations.\nOur second guest, Ron Ridenour, expands on the theme of his latest book, The Russian Peace Threat: Pentagon on Alert, which provides a historical context for the renewed cold war, deconstructs the propaganda depicting Russia as a menace, and details some of America’s far from benevolent records over the past century. He also hints at where the path to peace may lie.\nDmitry Orlov is a Russian-American writer, blogger and geopolitical analyst based in Moscow. He has degrees in Computer Engineering and Linguistics and has worked in the fields of high energy physics, internet commerce, advertising and network security. He is the author of Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Experience and American Prospects and Shrinking the Technosphere: Getting a Grip on the Technologies that Limit our Autonomy, Self-sufficiency and Freedom. His blog site is cluborlov.com.\nGlobal Research: We’re joined by Dmitry Orlov. He is a Russian-American writer, blogger, and geopolitical analyst. His work has centered around the political, economic, and ecological and political decline and collapse in the United States, and he’s also the author of numerous articles. His books include Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Experience and American Prospects and Shrinking The Technosphere: Getting A Grip On The Technologies That Limit Our Autonomy Self-Sufficiency, And Freedom. He joins us here from Moscow. Thanks so much for coming back to the show Dimitri.\nDmitry Orlov: Good to be with you Michael.\nDO: Well it’s a bit of a wake-up call for the Israelis because Russia has been extremely accommodating in everything that comes, when it comes to Israel’s security concerns. There is the realization that the rhetoric coming from Tehran has been, you know, quite virulent, you know, Iran is still telling itself that it has the goal of destroying Israel. There’s no way that Israel can avoid responding to such a provocation, and the fact that there are now Iranian troops close to the Israeli border, and that there is weapons manufacturing going on on Syrian territory is something that is a concern to them that the Russians have to allow Israel to take care of its own security concerns.\nBut the Israelis have acted most irresponsibly because they gave less than a minute warning that this attack was coming. They misnamed the targets, and they misbehaved in the airspace in the sense that they couldn’t have not seen this big lumbering propeller plane that was absolutely no threat to anyone, and they knew that there would be some anti-aircraft fire and drew it not on themselves but on this plane. There are some other, you know unfortunate mishaps that occurred, which are all coming out as a result of the investigation, so it’s still early to say.\nBut the response was basically to, you know, a dressing-down from Russia to Israelis, saying you cannot do this anymore, and the response was to arm the Syrians with a more up-to-date air defense system which was probably already in place. It was just handed over to Syrian command.\nI don’t think that this is a major development. I think Russia and Israel are going to patch things up. I don’t think Israel is going to stop attacking, stop attacking things, on the ground in Syria, that, you know, actions that they see as provocative. They are very fearful of precision rockets, precision weapons being built in Syria that can be smuggled into Syria or even fired, smuggled into Israel, or even fired into Israel from Lebanon or from Syria itself.\nDO: Well there is, there will be no declaration of surrender. Let’s not kid ourselves. Basically, what the US does in Syria, similar to what it does everywhere else, it generates activity. It generates activity in order to be in a position to order more weapons systems, more munitions, basically chew through more materiel, because that’s what the contractors require, and those contractors, military contractors, finance various congressional campaigns. That’s the entire political ecosystem, and what happens on the ground is sort of a sideshow.\nNow in terms of strategic objectives, whatever they are, the US definitely isn’t achieving them. There’s that encampment they have in Al-Tanf in the south, there are a few other locations in the north where they’re playing along with the Kurds, which is poisoning their relationship with Turkey. They did completely destroy Raqqa and made absolutely no effort to clean it up, to restore it, so there are still rotting bodies there buried under a piles of rubble, and it’s been many months. It’s basically a humanitarian atrocity that they’ve perpetuated in Raqqa, but they’re not achieving anything except wasting money and war materiel. And I think that that is actually their goal at this point is to generate military activity.\nDO: Oh, no, absolutely not. Basically, Russian posture, the Russian posture is to make sure that the US and NATO have absolutely no plan whatsoever to attack Russia, or to attack Russia’s allies. Perish the thought. But other than that, Russia’s posture is completely defensive, and American posture, because there is no need to defend the American homeland from anyone, nobody is planning to attack the United States, is purely offensive.\nDO: It’s really hard to figure out what is going to snap first. There’s definitely a huge amount of tension between Washington and the European Union. There is a huge amount of tension building up within the European Union itself, because the whole liberal juggernaut that started bringing in unlimited quantities of migrants into Europe, you know that is definitely running into a huge, huge problem, huge conflict that is internal to the EU.\nNow, the relationship between the EU and Russia has not really been all that badly damaged by Washington and by these sanctions that the Europeans have gone along with willy-nilly, many of them complaining all along the way. And, definitely, in terms of, for instance, energy cooperation between the EU and Russia is back on track because there are really no other options that the EU has to supply itself with natural gas other than to do business with Russia, and at this point that means also to circumvent the Ukraine because nobody really wants to do business with the Ukraine anymore. It’s basically a sort of poisoned chalice at this point.\nYou know, in terms of what the sanctions have done to the Russian economy, yes, they cost them a couple of percentage points of GDP growth, but the beneficial effect of those sanctions is often underestimated. It really woke Russia up to the fact that it has to become self-sufficient in many areas, and it has become self-sufficient in numerous areas and is working very hard to achieve self-sufficiency in more areas and to find new trading partners that aren’t going to sanction them. So, the sanctions have really woken up the Russians to the fact that the Americans are not their friends, will never be their friends, and have prompted them to act accordingly.\nGR: The US economic situation, they have an unsustainable debt crisis. It doesn’t look like they’re ever going to be able to crawl out of it, they don’t have the ability to maintain the, their current trajectory. I mean, we’re probably looking at another stock market crash, probably sooner rather than later, and I think the writing is on the wall in that regard. That’s bound to affect the way the US comports itself in the world, even though they won’t say it out loud. I mean, you suggested that earlier.\nSo that you have, you know, falling prices on some things and hyperinflation in other areas. There’ll be huge economic distortions, and the rest of the world will simply have to co-exist. They have a hoard of dollars, they use that hoard of dollars in order to trade with each other, they have contracts signed that are all in dollars. So, how do you de-dollarize that? It’s a gigantic task.\nWith the Skripal affair, it’s preposterous throughout. There’s absolutely no evidence behind the British story, and there are a lot of facts that are just completely contradictory and negate the narrative that has been voiced. And so the Russians are happy to basically sit back and ignore all of that. They know that there will be sanctions, these sanctions have nothing to do with chemical weapons, they have nothing to do with anything except one fact: Russia is sitting on a stockpile of energy resources that will last it for hundreds of years.\nThey’re basically jumping up and down mad that they have this problem that they can’t solve. They can’t attack Russia militarily. They’re trying to attack Russia economically, but that’s not working. They’re trying to isolate Russia, and as a result of that Russia is strengthening ties with countries all over the world. You know the SCO organization is now almost half of the world’s GDP, almost half of the world’s population. And it’s a security organization that Russia is part of.\nYou know, they try to stage little provocations like the little training exercises along the Russian border in the Baltics that are supposed to frighten Russia. Now if NATO attacked Russia, Russia would have them arrested. It doesn’t really make sense as a plan, but it makes sense as an internal narrative, something that these incompetent Western leaders can tell their own people."

        "text": "NEW YORK – Police have arrested a college student who walked around on his school&apos;s campus carrying a single-shot rifle and wearing a Bush rubber mask, police said.\nNo injuries were reported in the incident at St. John&apos;s University on Wednesday. It was unclear \"why on this particular day he brought a gun on campus,\" police spokesman Paul Browne said.\nPolice identified the student as Omesh Hiraman, 22, and said charges were pending. St. John&apos;s is a Catholic university of about 20,000 students located in the city&apos;s Queens borough.\nOther students, one of them a police cadet, reported seeing the armed man at around 2:30 p.m. walking near a building on the campus around the time he was supposed to be in a business class there, police said. The man was carrying a plastic bag with the barrel of a.50-caliber rifle sticking out and was wearing the Bush mask, with its mouth cut out.\nIn a statement, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly praised the cadet, 21-year-old Christopher Benson. Benson said he saw a man with a gun \"walking really fast\" and \"jumped right in\" to assist when campus security officers approached.\nUnarmed campus security officers and the student cadet tackled Hiraman as he walked toward a library, police said. Hiraman was turned over to the New York Police Department, which later searched his home near the campus.\nHiraman&apos;s father, Pat Hiraman, said the incident was \"a misunderstanding\" and his son, who lives at home near the school, \"would never harm anyone.\"\n\"Our son has always been a good boy and has never been in any sort of trouble,\" the father said.\nHe said his son hadn&apos;t been the same since having back surgery and was under heavy medication.\nStudents were told to stay inside their classrooms and buildings until around 5:30 p.m. Classes on the campus were canceled for the evening.\nKevin Su, an editor of the student newspaper, said students were ushered into buildings that were staffed with security guards and told to stay put. He said there was not much discussion of whether there were similarities between the incident Wednesday and the April 16 rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech, where a student gunman killed 32 people and then himself.\n\"I think it&apos;s basically on everyone&apos;s mind,\" Su said. \"It doesn&apos;t need to be said outright.\""

        "text": "Crowdfunding has exploded as a way of raising money for needy individuals and groups.\nThe websites may offer donors little guidance in navigating the tax implications of their gifts.\nLegally, those who give to some campaigns may be required to file a gift-tax return.\nIf the spate of recent national tragedies has tugged at your heartstrings and encouraged you to donate to a charitable crowdfunding campaign, beware: you're entering dicey legal territory.\nThat's because, in some cases, you may be required to file a gift-tax return, even if your donation was small in size, according to Martin Shenkman, founder of Fort Lee, New Jersey-based Shenkman Law.\nCharitable crowdfunding campaigns have exploded in popularity in recent years.\nAccording to a 2016 Pew Research Center report, 22 percent of American adults have contributed funds to crowdsourced fundraising project. The market for crowdfunding is expected to grow to greater than $300 billion by 2025, according to Fundly, a crowdfunding website that promotes itself as a platform to \"raise money for anything.\"\nYet the realm of charitable crowdfunding is a legal Wild West, and rife with pitfalls for donors and recipients.\nShenkman said the gift-tax conundrum may arise when campaigns are organized by a friend or relative of the ultimate recipient, and the recipient will not be the one who withdraws funds.\nAlthough the gift-tax exclusion allows individuals to give up to $14,000 to a given recipient, in 2017, without filing a gift-tax return, the money must be immediately available to the recipient to qualify for this exclusion (in legal parlance, it must be a gift of \"present interest\"). If crowdfunding donations can't be immediately withdrawn by the recipient, they may not pass this test, Shenkman said.\n\"You have this absurd result, that people who are giving small dollar amounts may actually have a gift-tax reporting requirement that they may violate,\" said Shenkman.\nAnother headache for donors: their contributions aren't deductible unless they donate to a qualified organization such as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. That means you can't deduct an amount you donated to assist with an individual's medical bills, for example. Medical fundraising is the fastest-growing category on YouCaring, a platform for \"compassionate crowdfunding,\" according to the company's website.\nCrowdfunding websites provide varying levels of assistance to donors trying to navigate tax rules.\nGoFundMe maintains a list of \"Certified Charities\" that have been verified as nonprofits, and automatically sends donors tax receipts for contributions to campaigns that benefit one of those charities. But the platform also allows recipients not on that list to describe their campaigns as a \"charity\" on its website.\nThe website of Generosity, a platform for \"socially conscious fundraising\" owned by Indiegogo, states that donors should contact campaign organizers to determine if donations are tax deductible. The website advertises campaigns that claim to benefit registered nonprofits alongside campaigns that make no such claims.\nDonations can even create unintended headaches for recipients.\nIf a beneficiary receives means-tested government benefits such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income, then receiving a large cash inflow from a crowdfunding campaign could cause him or her to lose government benefits, said Jonathan Blattmachr, a principal at Pioneer Wealth Partners in New York and director of estate planning for Peak Trust Company. That could mean that, for example, funds from crowdfunding pay for medical expenses that Medicaid would otherwise have covered.\n\"You might think you're helping the recipient, but you're actually hurting her,\" Blattmachr said.\nRaising funds on behalf of a supplemental or special needs trust, for individuals seeking help with medical bills, would circumvent the problem, Shenkman said.\nPerhaps the biggest problem for donors, however, is the difficulty in evaluating whether funds will actually be used for the purposes described in a crowdfunding campaign's pitch.\nGoFundMe, Indiegogo's Generosity and YouCaring all have procedures in place to guard against misuse of their platforms, according to spokespersons for each of the companies. But it's impossible for crowdfunding companies to thoroughly vet every organizer and recipient who uses their platforms, said Daniel Borochoff, founder of CharityWatch.\n\"It's convenient, and it's powerful because you can reach a lot of people quickly, but whether or not the money actually goes to its intended purpose is certainly not guaranteed,\" Borochoff said.\nBorochoff said donors should only contribute to a crowdfunding campaign if they trust the organizer, such as if it is someone they personally know or a respected community leader. If donors want to contribute to a non-profit organization, they should do so directly through the organization itself rather than through a crowdfunding website, which may collect its own fees from donations, he said.\nIn contrast to crowdfunding campaigns, Borochoff said, tax-exempt nonprofits are subjected to oversight by a board of directors and by regulators, and must submit annual filings to the Internal Revenue Service. Traditional nonprofits may also have more experience in vetting potential recipients, he said.\n\"With a lot of these websites it's very easy to feel good donating money,\" said Borochoff. \"But whether you're doing good can be unclear.\""

It doesn't matter to us — we do what we do to be a good neighbor.\"\nThe programs offered by Catholic Charities are many and varied. The organization feeds the hungry, helps out with bills, settles refugees into this country, facilitates adoptions and helps out with school supplies, among other services.\nThe Jacksonville Regional Office is the largest in the state, serving Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau and northern St. Johns counties.\nThe programs offered by Catholic Charities Jacksonville are many and varied. The organization feeds the hungry, helps out with bills, settles refugees into this country, facilitates adoptions and helps out with school supplies, among other services.\nIn September 2017, Catholic charities launched a two-year global campaign to welcome refugees and migrants under the leadership of Pope Francis, but the organization's Refugee Resettlement Program in Northeast Florida has been going on for many decades to help resettle individuals and reunite families who legally enter the United States.\nThe program, one of the largest in the state, assists refugees when they first arrive and for up to five years afterward. Clients receive extensive medical background and relationship checks before travel to the U.S. is approved. Many have fled their home countries because of persecution due to their race, religion, nationality or membership in a social or political group and have nowhere else to turn.\n\"From July 2016 to June 2017, we helped 152 refugees get settled into this country,\" Hopkins said. \"We assist in finding housing and provide classes in English as a Second Language, and we've set up a grant-matching program through which 260 refugees have already found jobs. We've found that refugees really want to work, so with training and an understanding of the workplace, they will be excellent employees.\"\nCamp I Am Special serves children and adults with disabilities in seven week-long overnight-camp sessions where each camper is paired one-on-one with a high-school buddy who helps with everything the camper does.The program is as popular with volunteers as it is with participants and has a waiting list of 150 volunteers.\nMany of those helped by Catholic Charities' Refugee Resettlement Program have limited English skills and employment histories, so ESL classes and help finding jobs is essential. Others have experienced emotional trauma, torture, the loss of family members or long years in refugee camps, making it necessary to \"tread lightly\" with an understanding heart.\n\"We have a very diverse staff of 62 employees in Jacksonville, with some members coming here as refugees themselves,\" Hopkins said. \"They have an immediate rapport with new arrivals, especially those from their home countries.\"\nRefugees aren't the only people having a difficult time finding employment, which is why Catholic Charities also offers a Workforce Development program.\n\"Five years ago, we were seeing many who had lost jobs and wanted desperately to get back to work,\" Hopkins said. \"With a three-year start-up grant from the Jessie Ball DuPont Fund, we have helped 937 people in the last five years, with 411 gaining employment.\"\nThe weeklong program offers job readiness classes, help with resume-writing and interviewing, as well as a closet filled with clothes appropriate for job interviews. Then, for up to four months afterward, participants can come back to the center to use the computers, get help with cover letters and apply for jobs.\n\"We also help with some of the barriers to employment — arrange child care, provide bus passes and appropriate clothing,\" Hopkins said. \"And we work with the Family Foundation to provide mental health counseling for those who are not yet ready to work.\n\"The main point with all our programs is that we treat each participant as an individual, showing compassion and love, and listening to what they have to say. These are individuals and a one-size-fits-all approach simply won't work.\"\nCatholic Charities' Immigration and Legalization program works with immigrants of all types, not just refugees. The program has been accredited for more than 10 years by the Council on Accreditation — only nine organizations in Jacksonville have that accreditation — and by the Department of Justice, so its staff can do the work that an immigration attorney would do. In the past year, the program has helped 512 documented immigrants with their paperwork.\nHigh on the list of programs that everyone — participants and staff alike — loves is Camp I Am Special, also ACA accredited for children and adults with disabilities. The camp serves those ages five through 65 in seven weeklong overnight-camp sessions, during which each participant is paired one-on-one with a high-school buddy who helps with absolutely everything.\n\"This has been going on for 34 years with an incredible amount of success,\" Hopkins said. \"I was actually a volunteer for four summers while I was in high school and so was my brother. It was there that he learned to have a love for these special children. He went on to medical school to become a pediatrician with a specialty in autism, and it's all because of volunteering at Camp I Am Special. It's such a wonderful experience that earlier volunteers are now doctors, nurses and lead nonprofits. Right now, there is a volunteer waiting list with 150 names on it.\"\nResponse from the community has been generous as well. When the camp's 50-year-old swimming pool was finally declared unusable, $900,000 was raised and a new pool, designed by Auld & White, is scheduled to open in December.\nBecause Catholic Charities is always looking for volunteers and donations, the 26th Annual Black & White Ball will be held on March 3 next year.\n\"We had 500 attendees last years and the venue wasn't large enough, so this year, we'll be having the event at EverBank Field,\" Hopkins said. \"This is the first time we've had it at the stadium, so we're really excited. We expect from 600 to 700 guests.\"\nThese are just a few of the many programs available through Catholic Charities.\n\"We are so grateful for the community's awareness and support of our programs,\" Hopkins said. \"We have 22 people on our board who serve as advocates in the community; we couldn't do what we do without people caring about the vulnerable.\"\nCatholic Charities To advocate for the community and to help Catholic Charities care for those less fortunate, visit the website at ccbjax.org and click on the \"Donate\" button or on \"How You Can Help.\""

There's no agenda in the USB drive and seemingly no Google people present. Google must be the surprise speakers.\n11:03: The T-Mobile-Google MyTouch 3G Launch event at the Skyline Studios on the west side. This event is a much more casual affair than the G1 launch from last September.\nThere's no agenda in the USB drive and seemingly no Google people present. Google must be the surprise speakers. Also, the press releases are the same two T-Mobile and Geodelic issued June 22 when the news formally broke.\nCole Brodman, senior vice president, chief technology and innovation officer, and Denny Marie Post, senior vice president and chief marketing officer, are slated to speak.\n11:09: Event starts. Brodman introduces Post, who says she is excited to talk about the launch.\nToday, existing T-Mobile customers can begin pre-ordering the phone through July 28 to get it before the national retail availability of the device on Aug. 5. As reported, the device will cost $199 for a two-year contract.\nPost: The phone taps into our self-expression. The myTouch 3G lets users create self-expression from inside out. The Android OS is much like taking crayons or water colors to create a device that is 100 percent you. Interesting marketing pitch.\n11:11: Brodman: Says T-Mobile is fortunate to have Google as a partner. Talks about the G1 and how it lets users tap into innovation from Google and third-party application developers. Rich global ecosystem of software and hardware.\n11:13: T-Mobile continues to invest in that strong Google partnership. Brodman promises more Android products later this year, but the myTouch 3G is the next big step along that path.\n11:15: Post: Says the myTouch 3G is a slick device, fits in the hand very easily. \"It's the kind of device you feel very bold to experiment with it and get into it. A premium device to get into the smartphone category.\"\nPost compares it to a custom car. \"It becomes 100 percent you.\" I see a mantra developing. Three ways the myTouch 3G will be able to personalize it. Video time.\n11:16: Woman in video says if the myTouch 3G could sweat for you, it would. Ewwww. Maybe too personal. She says the weather widget lets her know whether or not it will be lousy weather (she must do yoga). She also does Google searches on the myTouch.\n11:18: Another woman says if it could go through airport security for her, it would. She uses it to search for a cool restaurant and to keep up on Facebook. She also demonstrates the translator app and books a last-second deal. She can one-click to Wikipedia and personalize her adventures.\n11:19: Next, a rocker dude in the video says if it could make you a rock star it would. He makes music and e-mails the clips and posts YouTube videos through the myTouch. Tweets on Twitter when he's about to go on stage. Post pics on Facebook and has ringtones for all his friends so he knows who's calling while he posts Web content.\n11:21: \"If it could make you cool, well, actually it pretty much does.\" Putting the person back into personalized. Video ends.\nBrodman: The video shows us how to personalize with the myTouch. Brodman's been using the myTouch for weeks and months. Uses it many ways. No two myTouch devices are alike, he says.\n11:23: Brodman uses Google Talk, Exchange, Weather Bug, and does Google Voice searches. He uses it to juggle personal and business work.\n11:24: Post says as a working mother, she also keeps personal and business content. Connects her with family. She and her son play Zombie Run on the myTouch in malls. \"It's about the applications, but more importantly it's about the expression of who I am.\"\n11:25: Brodman discusses apps on the myTouch. T-Mobile and Google help users find new apps through T-Mobile store or the device itself. T-Mobile App Pack a new app coming in weeks. T-Mobile and third-party partner apps. Discusses Geodelic's Sherpa.\n11:26: Geodelic is a recommendation and discovery engine for mobile. Find personalized, localized content, businesses, shops, restaurants. It gets smarter and more personal as you go.\n11:27: How will T-Mobile make apps payment easier? T-mobile and Google will do a direct bill option directly from the myTouch. It won't replace current payment options, but provide an additional purchase avenue.\n11:28: Post shows the device packaging, with guide, polish cloth, Special material to polish the screen. Comes in every box to keep it clean. It will have many accessories. Relationship with Skinit for custom skins.\n11:30: Retail experience: Pop for consumers. T-Mobile training sells reps to make myTouch a great success. 1) make it work. 2) make it mine. 3) make it easy. Duh.\n11:32: Post says T-Mobile will bring this market by consumer word of mouth. Equity of value versus any carriers out there. In mid-August, T-Mobile will launch a big advertising campaign centered on \"100% You.\" TV, print, online -- the works.\n11:35: Brodman wraps us up with: MyTouch and investment in Android is big for T-Mobile. Brings innovation of Web to mobile devices. Android products, services and applications. Starts with G1, then myTouch 3G, will continue in other devices.\nQuestion 1: Are there plans to bring the HTC Hero to the U.S.?\nNo current plans to do this, Brodman says. In second half of the year there will be lots of Android devices, including more from T-Mobile.\nQuestion 2: Does this phone do multitasking? Can you have music playing and get into an app at the same time?\nAbsolutely, Post and Brodman say. Widgets are live, so you'll get multiple apps working at once.\nQuestion 3: How is myTouch 3G different from the G1?\n11:39: Brodman: It's about choice -- G1 is more tech-centric. MyTouch has more personalization features. Built differently from G1. Post says myTouch is for more general audience. Very easy and sleek.\nThis was a disappointing launch compared to the G1. There were no Google people here at all. Videos of everyday people using the device are no substitute for Larry or Sergey, not even Android creator Andy Rubin.\nNot much new, but we've got a better sense of the myTouch 3G marketing campaign, which will flaunt the personalization aspects.\nMy sense is that this will be a super social networking phone, the type of gadget that will be a blast to be roaming a different country with: it will help you find local businesses and haunts, take multimedia content and push it out to users or directly to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.\nSure, we can do a lot of this stuff on the G1 and other gadgets, but the myTouch is designed to make it easier for us."

        "text": "June 7, 2007 3:02 P.M.\nSUDBURY - The Ontario government is undertaking an important rehabilitation project on Highway 17 east of Ignace, Northern Development and Mines Minister Rick Bartolucci announced today.\n\"Our government recognizes the importance of a safe, well maintained network of highways to the economic and social well-being of the North,\" said Bartolucci. \"We understand that high quality infrastructure is an underlying requirement for strong communities.\"\nThe project involves resurfacing and reconstructing 16 kilometres east of English River. Improvements include increasing the shoulder width along existing passing lanes, the treatment of frost heave areas and drainage enhancements. There will also be upgrades to three snow plow turn-arounds in the area. A contract in the amount of $9,397,798 has been awarded to Miller Northwest of Markham. The project will get underway this spring and is scheduled for completion this fall.\n\"We have laid out a strategic program and budgeted record investments in the expansion and rehabilitation of northern highways,\" said Bartolucci. \"We will continue to invest in these important infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\"The government's ongoing commitment to improving highway infrastructure across the region is helping our northern communities to grow and prosper,\" said Transportation Minister Donna Cansfield. \"Better highways foster economic development and create jobs.\"\nThe McGuinty government's five-year, $1.8-billion Northern Ontario Highways Strategy is forecast to result in the repair of 2,000 kilometres of highway and an additional 64 kilometres of northern highway system expansion. The strategy, now in its third year, is an important component of the Northern Prosperity Plan, which is founded on four key pillars: Strengthening the North and its Communities; Listening to and Serving Northerners Better; Competing Globally; and Providing Opportunities for All.\nThis document was published on June 07, 2007 and is provided for archival and research purposes."

        "text": "The objectives of the proposed work are to design, prepare and characterize a family of new advanced electron transport materials from simple, minimal-step, high-yield, and inexpensive synthetic processes for application in organic photovoltaics (OPV). These novel materials will be chemically prepared by linking together conjugated electron deficient moieties that may include, but are not limited to, phenyl- and naphthyl-imides, benzothiadiazoles, dicyanoimidazoles, and diketo-pyrrolo-pyrroles. These new materials will be used to fabricate OPV devices with efficiencies and lifetimes exceeding those of state-of-art OPVs that typically use fullerene-based electron transport materials.\nOrganic photovoltaics (OPV) have recently reached power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 7.7%1 and extrapolated lifetimes of >30 years2 bringing this area of technology closer to commercialization. Common to both of these reports are the use of fullerenes as the electron acceptor/transport materials. Fullerenes tend to have low absorption in the visible range, produce devices with relatively low open circuit voltages (Voc), are very difficult to synthesize and purify, and are very expensive.\nFigure 2: Potential improvement in the current-voltage characteristics from using new acceptor materials.\nNew acceptor materials that could address and solve the issues of fullerenes could push PCE levels to >10%. For example, replacing the weakly absorbing fullerenes with more strongly absorbing acceptors should lead to efficient light harvesting below 700nm (Figure 1) and increased short circuit current densities (Jsc). Assuming a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.75, Jsc can potentially be improved from 15.2 mA/cm2 in the record device to 17.2 mA/cm2 (Figure 2).\nFigure 3: Schematic of general strategy for materials design for application in OPVs.\nThe general strategy of how the materials will be designed to address important properties necessary for OPV acceptors is shown in Figure 3. The materials will have two different electron deficient moieties linked together in an A-B-A type arrangement. Furthermore the A-B-A moieties will be linked by alkene, alkyne and/or phenyl linkages (sp2 hybridization) that will allow for electron delocalization throughout the molecule, thus stabilizing the negative charge over the entire molecule. Although the A-B-A moieties will be electron deficient in nature, they will have different degrees of deficiency so as to have partial push-pull character. This is known to impart low band gap properties, important for absorbing a greater amount of the visible spectrum.\nThe proposed research is designed to be very interdisciplinary involving synthetic organic chemistry, materials characterization, and device processing/characterization. The research is aimed towards the goal of OPVs with PCEs >10% by the end of the project and will be divided into two sections – chemical synthesis and device physics. Design and synthesis of new electron deficient molecules will be carried out to achieve crucial fundamental properties such as: proper electronic energy levels; strong visible light absorption; side chain attachments for solution or vacuum processing; and solid-state packing for optimized charge transport. Charge carrier mobilities and solid state morphologies of neat and blend thin films using various microscopy and x-ray techniques will be examined. Energetic loss pathways due to triplet and charge transfer states will be explored using spectroscopic techniques. The physical, thermal, optical, and electronic properties of the materials are designed to be tunable so that they may be used with a large number of corresponding electron donor materials for device fabrication.\nChen, H.

        "text": "Despite the critique we have offered in the past, Zanu PF in its recently launched manifesto, insist on claiming that its vision is for Zimbabwe to be a middle-income country (MIC) by 2030.\nThis is a bland and banal statement which requires qualification, quantification and supporting details for it to be meaningful. What does that vision statement even mean?\nThe MIC nomenclature is a World Bank analytical tool that refers to economies with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranging from $1 005 to $12 235.\nThis is too broad a grouping. In any case our GDP per capita income is $977, hence jumping to $1 005 (if we consider minimum qualification) over 12 years is not sufficiently ambitious. This is not visionary at all.\nIt is instructive to note that the MICs are broken up into lower-MIC and upper-MICs.\nLower-MICs have GDP per capita ranging from $1 006 to $3 955, while upper-MICs have per GDP per capita ranging from $3 956 to $12 235.\nDoes Zanu PF aim for Zimbabwe to be a lower-MIC or an upper-MIC?\nMore importantly, what is the target GDP per capita in their vision formulation?\nThey must be specific and say we aim to be an MIC with a stated GDP per capita number (or range of numbers).\nEven with this flawed approach to the national vision process, there is need for caution.\nUnder this rule, the number of years to double a GDP per capita is equal to 70 divided by the growth rate.\nSo, for example, if we grow by 3%, then it will take us 70/3 = 23,33 years, to double our GDP per capita.\nIf we grow at 5%, then it will take us 14 years. For Zimbabwe to double its GDP per capita by 2030, that is, attain a GDP per capita of at least $1 944, it needs to grow by about 6% every year for the next 12 years — which is a tall order.\nChina did it though, but it is not easy. In Zanu PF’s vision, what is the target growth rate for Zimbabwe for the next 12 years to 2030?\nIn the manifesto, there is target of attaining a growth rate of at least 6% per annum over the period 2018 to 2023. What happens beyond 2023? They do not tell us.\nLet us be generous and assume that Zanu PF wants to double our GDP per capita by 2030 — which would require an average growth of 6% for 12 years.\nThe problem is that it has been a historical impossibility, with the exception of China.\nFor example, between 1970 and 2010, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries only grew by an average of 1,9%!\nWith Zimbabwe, for sure in the first few years, we may experience above average growth rates because of our low base, but we will eventually gravitate towards standard and traditional growth rates, which are much lower than 6%.\nMore significantly from my analysis of their entire Zanu PF manifesto, I don’t see where that growth of at least 6% over the period 2018 to 2030, will come from.\nThere is absolutely no articulated and demonstrated sources of such phenomenal growth. Nothing!\nIt is neither sensible nor meaningful for Zanu PF to posit that their vision is for Zimbabwe to be an MIC by 2030.\nZimbabwe needs a proper vision process and a more rigorous economic planning effort.\nIn its 2018 manifesto, Zanu PF gets both the vision process and vision content wrong.\nA national vision has three pillars — politics, society & the economy — with over-arching issues being values and mega-impact projects.\nAaagh Professor dai maramba muchitambira ku Robotics and Mechatronics and spare us the academic masturbation that you are now spewing. Ethiopia growth rate has been double digit for the last decade and the country lifted more than 50 million people out of extreme poverty in a decade. Meles Zenawi was a visionary.

I dont even want to say South Africa but Ethiopia is doing with the help of the Chinese of course. Munangagwa is not Mugabe just like Deng Xiaoping was not Mao despite long time with Mao he changed China to what it is today so ED can do it if he wants which I think he does.\nAnything is possible if you put your mind to it.

SA’s GDP growth rates prior to 2010 under Thabo Mbeki were driven by consumption expenditure – mainly retail/tertiary sector driven. That is why it was said to be jobless growth. It was growth that created no jobs but enriched the Capitalists.

        "text": "A teacher, a wife, and mom who thought she'd beaten cancer once was right back where she started.\nIf, as the old adage goes, laughter is the best medicine, then a middle school teacher in Arlington is battling her second round of cancer with the best medicine she, her family, and a standup comic can find.\nJade Laswell, a seventh and eighth grade teacher at Shackleford Junior High, had her first cancer scare September of 2016 at her very first mammogram. She was only 41 years old when her doctors found a suspicious lump, which led to a bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy, and a doctor's promise that the odds were in her favor: that her type of cancer only had a 2 percent to 5 percent recurrence.\n\"And I was actually in the middle of a reconstruction surgery this January when, the morning of my surgery, I found a lump. My surgeon found me, sat down next to me to tell me there were cancer cells on that lump. So, we've just started over again a couple weeks ago,\" she said.\nShe was one of the 2 percent to 5 percent. A teacher, a wife, and mom who thought she'd beaten cancer once was right back where she started.\n\"My heart like, literally, how do you describe like, where you have that dropping feeling in your stomach, where like my breath literally was taken away? I was just devastated. Absolutely devastated and couldn't stop crying,\" she said.\nWhat you'll notice if you're around Jade for only a few minutes, whether at school or at home with her husband and four children, is that instead of crying, she very much prefers to laugh instead.\n\"It's a very, very dark place when you're dealing with cancer. It's scary, and there are a lot of scary things. And to be able to make fun of it, kind of takes the power away from the cancer,\" she said. \"It's nice to connect with other people who get that, who understand that fight! Because not everybody will understand that fight.\"\nShe found that someone on a recent Friday night at the Deep Ellum Art Company. The performer was a San Antonio native named Larry Garza. A stage 4 kidney cancer survivor, the \"cancer comic\" has made his journey, and his survival, part of his act.\n\"So on a lighter note, I almost died,\" he said to loud, but sometimes, uncomfortable laughs from the comedy club crowd.\nAnd on this night, Jade Laswell was in the crowd, soaking up all the potential best medicine her fellow cancer fighter could offer.\n\"I had a grapefruit size tumor grow in my kidney,\" he told the audience. \"That developed into a lemon size tumor in my lung. You guys have no idea how hard that is for a Mexican to grow fruit and not be able to sell it! That was really hard for me,\" Garza joked as the crowd, including Jade Laswell, laughed.\n\"I just wanted to tell my kids I love them one more time,\" Garza joked about his initial fear of death. \"And I just wanted to tell my life like....Well, you're alright!\"\nBut to any fellow cancer fighters that might be in the audience, he sincerely offered this. \"Come talk to me after the show, we have a connection now,\" he said.\n\"Yes we do,\" said Jade seated next to her husband in the audience.\nThe two cancer fighters did meet after the show, shared stories and shared laughs for more than a half hour.\n\"But....you're gonna be fine,\" Garza told her.\n\"And you're gonna be fine,\" Laswell replied. \"And we just keep going.\"\n\"And we're going to be like 80 years old saying,'Remember when we were scared we had cancer,\" Garza joked as they shared another laugh together.\n\"You just have to frickin’ laugh through it,\" Laswell said. \"What are your choices?\"\n\"When you joke about it, you take the power away from it,\" Garza said.\n\"That's exactly what I said earlier,\" Laswell replied. \"Did you hear that earlier? I said that earlier!\"\n\"Joking about it to me is really important because it lightens it,\" Garza said in an interview with WFAA photojournalist Michael Botsford. \"As much negativity comes with the disease, one thing that is positive about it is community, is family, and love really. I know it sounds mushy, but it's true.\"\nStudies have shown that laughter does have its benefits -- that people with a strong sense of humor have outlived those who don't, especially when battling something as brutal as cancer.\nJade Laswell plans to keep busy laughing, especially when she gets news like she got last week. She made the announcement to her students at school.\n\"Well, it came back clear. There's no cancer. So they're not finding any cancer in my body,\" she said as the students responded with applause and hugs.\n\"And sometimes, with this cancer fight, it's just about waking up and putting one foot in front of the other and hanging onto a little tiny piece of hope that you can survive what the day is going to bring you, because you really don't ever know,\" she said.\nBut we do know that in her classroom, among all the positive and encouraging messages on the walls, is the one right behind her. It says \"a day without laughter is a day wasted.\"\nSo here's to Jade's and Larry’s journeys of no wasted days and laughing in the face of cancer every precious moment they can.\nJade Laswell is also busy running her own nonprofit. It's called Craft Hope and sends care packages to families in need, including children in hospitals fighting their own battles with cancer.\nLarry Garza, meanwhile, said he is improving too, healthy enough now to tour comedy clubs all over Texas.\nClick here for information on how to donate to Jade Laswell's fight on cancer."

        "text": "In what may have been the final start of his career, John Lackey pitched a beauty to help the Cubs clinch the NL Central title.\nST. LOUIS — They kept looking for him Wednesday night, calling his name, chanting his name, louder and louder and louder, until Chicago Cubs pitcher John Lackey finally emerged.\nThe Cubs, who had just clinched the NL Central title with a 5-1 victory over the rival St. Louis Cardinals, kept the celebration relatively tame until Lackey’s arrival, clearing a path for him into the middle of the clubhouse.\nLackey slowly walked towards the middle, and with every step he took, they chanted his name, dousing him with beer, spraying him with champagne, until he stepped into the circle, where teammate Jon Lester was standing.\nLester, his teammate of nearly eight years, with the two of them winning two World Series championships together with two different organizations, asked the room for quiet.\nThe clock now reading 9:25 p.m., Lester began to toast not only one of his closest friends, but perhaps as fine a teammate he’s ever had in his career.\n\"He didn’t come here for no bleeping haircut boys,\" Lester began, stealing Lackey’s infamous line of a year ago. \"I know we got the playoffs going guys, but I’ve had the pleasure of calling this guy a teammate for eight years. I’ve learned a lot about the game from this guy, and I’m sure you guys have too.\n\"Here’s to one of the best teammates and one of the best people I’ve ever got to play with.\n\"Tonight is probably his last regular-season start. Here’s to one hell of a career.\"\nLester and Lackey embraced, and as his teammates screamed even louder, Cubs bench coach Davey Martinez grabbed a bottle of Crown Royal. Lackey tipped his head back, and Martinez poured it down his throat.\nLackey, chugging it down as if he were at a fraternity keg party, then yelled out: \"This is for the boys on the bus!\"\n\"We’re not stopping here boys. We got 11 more. Eleven more. Eleven bleeping more. So keep it going. Keep it rolling. I’m proud of every one of you guys. Eleven more. Eleven more. Let me hear it.\"\nThe Cubs, their T-shirts soaked with beer, all began chanting: \"Eleven more! Eleven more! Eleven more!\"\nThe Cubs, only the second World Series champion in eight years to return to the postseason in the ensuing season, won’t be the favorites to win it like a year ago, not with just 89 victories, but they know they’ve got a chance.\n\"That’s all you can ask for,\" Cubs president Theo Epstein said. \"We’ve got an opportunity. That’s all you want. I’m sure people aren’t picking us to win the whole thing again. But it doesn’t really matter. It’s opportunity.\n\"Our guys love the opportunity. They love big games. They love competition at the highest level. So it’s an opportunity to make some history.\"\nCertainly, there are few active pitchers who have taken advantage of their opportunity, thriving on baseball’s biggest stage, more than Lackey. He was a rookie in 2002 when he stepped onto the mound for the Los Angeles Angels in Game 7 of the World Series, and became the first rookie to win Game 7 since Babe Adams in 1909 for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He won the clinching Game 6 with the 2013 Boston Red Sox, celebrating their first title at Fenway Park since 1918. And again last year with the Cubs winning their first title in 108 years.\nIt was likely the last time that Lackey (12-11, 4.56 ERA) will ever start a game. He will be on the Cubs’ postseason roster, but he’s expected to pitch out of the bullpen. But if this is really it, and that was the final start of his life, he sure went with a beauty, as the first Cubs pitcher to win a clinching game in St. Louis since 1938.\nHe dazzled the Cardinals for six innings, giving up just two hits and one run, suffocating the same offense that scored seven runs a night earlier and winning for the 188th and, perhaps, final time of his career.\nLackey hasn’t publicly discussed his likely retirement and has shared his plans with only his closest friends and family, but Lester wanted to make sure to put the spotlight back on Lackey, wanting him to treasure this night forever.\n\"I wanted to do that as a repay for everything he’s done for me,\" Lester said. \"I think this is it for him, but if he does end up pitching somewhere, he owes me some beers.\"\nLackey has spent 15 years in the big leagues and all but two months with Lester since 2010.\nWhen they each were traded away from the Boston Red Sox in the summer of 2014, it was Lester who convinced him to join the Cubs as a free agent after the 2015 season, allowing the two of them to share history together when the Cubs won their first World Series since 1908.\n\"Really,\" says Lester, \"he’s family to me.\"\nLackey may have a perpetual scowl on the mound and be cranky with the media, but Epstein has never been around a player whose public perception is as vastly different as the respect and admiration he has in the clubhouse.\nLate Wednesday night, he had whiskey to drink, champagne to spray, and a whole lot of cold beer to finish before the end of the night.\n\"You always celebrate like it’s your last one,\" Lester said. \"You don’t know what’s going to happen or what’s in store for you. I know people get mad about all of these celebrations, but I’d rather go all out than regret it not doing it when you had the chance.\n\"It’s the same with Lack. We are going to celebrate. And we’re going to celebrate together.\n\"This is what it’s all about.\"\nFollow columnist Bob Nightengale on Twitter @BNightengale."

She came to IBT four years ago as Breaking News Editor and has contributed enormously to the company every day since, becoming Managing Editor of IBT before moving to Newsweek as News Director,” said Cooper.\nSilva was one of the top editors at the site and her name is still prominently featured on the masthead. She is also a notable survivor from some of the most perilous days at the company, which saw staff shakeups, mass firings and management turmoil earlier this year.\nIn the memo, Cooper said that Silva planned to return to freelance writing and teaching as an adjunct professor at NYU. She also plans to travel.\nIt’s unclear who will replace Silva. A Newsweek insider told TheWrap that they expect the company to look for high profile outside talent to fill the position.\nOnce one of the most venerable news magazines in the country, Newsweek has suffered in recent years as it has struggled to pivot to digital platforms. The company has been accused of inflating its traffic numbers in an effort to bilk advertisers, while also providing free advertising for a Christian university linked to senior management at Newsweek’s parent company IBT.\nNewsweek’s offices in Manhattan were raided by the Manhattan D.A. as part of a long-running probe, the exact details of which still remain mysterious. In February, several insiders told TheWrap that employees were in a state of near revolt over unpaid salaries.\nThe company took punitive action internally against those deemed disloyal and fired senior correspondent Celeste Katz over this article she co-bylined investigating Newsweek’s troubles.\n“This is the story Newsweek editors and a reporter were fired over,” reads a description of the article which remains live on the Newsweek site.\nIn an editor’s note, the magazine’s senior editorial leadership — including Silva — admitted “egregious breaches of confidentiality and journalism ethics,” with respect to how management handled the story."

        "text": "Sacrament of the New Law, instituted by Christ to give the sick spiritual aid and strength and to perfect spiritual health, including, if need be, the remission of sins. Conditionally it also restores bodily health to Christians who are seriously ill. It consists essentially in the anointing by a priest of the forehead and the hands, while pronouncing the words \"Through this holy anointing and His most loving mercy, may the Lord assist you by the grace of the Holy Spirit, so that, freed from your sins, He may save you and in His goodness raise you up.\" In case of necessity, a singly anointing of the forehead or of an other suitable part of the body suffices. Olive oil, blessed by a bishop, is normally used for the anointing, but any vegetable oil may be substituted in case of emergency.\nThe institution of anointing by Christ is an article of the Catholic faith, defined by the Council of Trent (Denzinger 1716). The Church further teaches that this sacrament is implied in Gospel reference to Christ sending out the disciples, who \"anointed many sick people with oil and cured them\" (Mark 6:13); moreover that the sacrament was promulgated by the Apostle James when he wrote, \"Is anyone among you sick? Let him bring in the presbyters of the Church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick man and the Lord will raise him up and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him\" (James 5:14-15)."

The Rockets lead the series 2-0, but the Mavs are hoping Barea and Felton can help them win Friday, put pressure on Houston and climb right back in this series.\nWhile Rondo had apparently mentally checked out of Game 2 after a series of unforced errors, Barea played 34 minutes, scored 13 points, grabbed six rebounds and was 5 of 14 from the field. Felton scored nine points and was 3 of 9 from the floor in 18 minutes.\nBarea averaged 7.5 points and 3.4 assists in 17.7 minutes this season, and also started 10 games. Felton averaged 3.7 points and 1.4 assists in 9.7 minutes, and made three starts.\nBut Felton was limited to only 29 games after he suffered a nasty high ankle injury in the second preseason game against Oklahoma City, and then served a four-game NBA-imposed suspension after pleading guilty in June to a gun charge in New York.\nThe Mavs also are optimistic that point guard Devin Harris will be able to play Friday. Harris missed Game 2 with a recurring injury to his great left toe — an injury that occurred April 13 against Utah.\n“The hope is that he won’t have any restrictions either in terms of minutes or anything like that,” Carlisle said. “The adrenaline of the game starts and that can help, too.\nHarris wasn’t limited in practice Thursday, but noted that there weren’t a lot of contact drills. He did, however, admit to a wardrobe change.\n“I changed shoes completely and got another injection [Wednesday],” Harris said. “Back to a normal size, what I was playing with before.\nWith Rondo now a footnote in Mavs’ history, Harris knows the Mavs don’t have time to dwell on what’s past. Particularly with the Rockets’ James Harden and Dwight Howard ready to make life miserable for Dallas again.\n“We’ve been short-handed a little bit throughout the year,” Harris said. “Other guys have stepped up.\nAnd the guys the Mavs have running the show at point guard — Barea, Felton and Harris — are left to make the best of what turned into a combustible situation with Rondo.\n“Well, we’ve just got to bring high energy, we’ve got to play together, we’ve got to play with pace, we’ve got to play with discretion, we’ve got to be aggressive without being frantic,” Carlisle said. “I like our team."

She will participate in the USTA-ITF Junior Wheelchair Tennis Camp.\nPORT ORANGE — Auburn Smith was born into sports.\nHer first name largely derives from her father's love of Auburn University, where he has attended football games since childhood.\n“She loves it when we go to the football games and they're chanting her name,” said Jimmy Smith, her father.\nShe was also born with spina bifida, the most common permanently disabling birth defect in the United States, according to the Spina Bifida Association. Literally meaning “split spine” in Latin, spina bifida occurs when a baby is in the womb and the spinal column does not close all the way.\nAcross the United States, roughly eight babies are born with spina bifida or a similar defect of the brain and spine every day.\nAgainst the odds, Smith, 16, has become a nationally ranked wheelchair tennis player. She will participate in the USTA-ITF Junior Wheelchair Tennis Camp in Mission Viejo, Calif. from July 28-Aug. 2.\n32 athletes from ages 12-18 from across the globe, spanning 10 states and six countries, will attend the camp to improve their skills and receive instruction from some of the top coaches in the world.\nThis will be the Smith family's fifth straight summer trip to Southern California.\nSmith primarily enjoys getting to see the friends she has made over the last five years. The campers spend virtually the entire six-day period together, including an annual trip to a theme park.\nDan James, the USTA's national head coach and national manager of wheelchair tennis, will be one of the primary instructors at the camp. Even though he has coached in four Paralympic games, he says the camp is his favorite week of the year.\nThe soon-to-be junior at Spruce Creek began playing tennis at the age of 7. Since then, she has worked with Nancy Olson, who runs the \"Tennis Everyone!\" program for Easter Seals of Volusia Flagler Counties.\nOlson helped Smith gain exposure across the country since, in her opinion, Florida is not recognized as a wheelchair tennis hotbed.\n“I wanted her to have the example of how good she could be and to see really good tennis,” said Olson, a two-time Paralympic silver medalist in wheelchair tennis.\nSmith was named a National Youth Representative for Easter Seals on Oct. 25, 2012, becoming the first national representative from the Easter Seals affiliate in Volusia and Flagler counties.\nNot only has Smith had a positive influence on others with disabilities but also with her own family. Jimmy gave up a job in business management to become a registered nurse in honor of Auburn."

Missing or inadequate insulation also leads to higher utility bills due to wasted energy, and may result in more maintenance and more frequent replacement of your heating equipment. And, a well-insulated basement is a selling point when it comes time to put your home on the market. Save money and protect the environment from the effects of air pollution by installing insulation in your basement to conserve energy.\nMeasure the depth of your exposed wood framing using a tape measure. Choose your insulation based on the available space and your budget.\nPut on your safety glasses and gloves before handling the insulation.\nCut fiberglass batts to fit between the exposed wooden studs. Size the batts to fit snugly between the framing members so that friction will be enough to hold them in place.\nPlace the batts into the wall cavity, adding several layers as needed to achieve the desired R-value.\nFinish the walls with drywall or leave unfinished, as desired.\nCover the entire wall with a vapor barrier, such as 6 mm polyethylene. Secure the edges of each sheet to the wall using construction adhesive, and overlap each row by 6-inches. Tape the seams of the vapor barrier using heavy clear tape.\nMeasure over 16 inches from one corner of each masonry wall. Mark this spot with a marker or chalk, then continue to make marks every 16 inches along the length of the wall.\nPlace 1 by 2 inch furring strips at the marks you made on the wall. Use concrete or masonry screws to secure each furring strip to the wall.\nCut rigid foam sheets to fit between the furring strips using your utility knife. Size the sheets so they fit snugly between each strip.\nInsert the sheets of rigid foam between the furring strips. If friction isn't enough to hold the sheets in place, add a bit of construction adhesive to the back of each sheet. Add a second layer of foam to maximize R-value.\nCover the furred-out wall with 1/2-inch drywall. Screw the drywall to the furring strips using drywall screws and finish as desired.\nEnergy Savers recommends insulating the interior side of basement walls to between R-5 and R-19 depending on where you live. Choose high-performance insulation products to achieve a greater R-value per inch, or stick with standard products to save money if space is not a concern.\nWear safety glasses and gloves to protect yourself when handling fiberglass insulation.\nNever install rigid foam products without covering them with 1/2-inch drywall. These materials release toxic fumes during a fire that could pose a significant health risk to your family.\nBeach, Emily. \"How to Insulate Basements.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/insulate-basements-8635.html.

She remains hospitalized at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton.\n“She was just the innocent victim of (Griffin’s) criminal activities,” Dorsey said.\nGriffin was hospitalized after the collision but was discharged this morning. Griffin is from Washington state, and was passing through the area hoping to eventually reach Florida, Dorsey said. He has no known local addresses, Dorsey said.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Griffin reportedly stole a Toyota Camry from the Union 76 gas station at the intersection of Arrow and Hermosa Avenue, Dorsey said.\nAt about 1:40 p.m., a sheriff’s deputy saw Griffin driving erratically as he pulled out of a shopping center at the corner of Arrow and Archibald Avenue, Dorsey said.\nThe sheriff’s deputy made a U-turn intending to make a traffic stop on Griffin’s car, Dorsey said. As the deputy continued to watch Griffin’s car, he saw the vehicle drive west on Arrow at speeds of up to 80 mph and run red lights at Archibald, Hellman Avenue, and Vineyard, Dorsey said.\nAt the Vineyard intersection, Griffin collided with Garcia, who was traveling north on Vineyard in a 2010 Hyundai. Griffin slammed into the passenger side of Garcia’s car. Garcia didn’t have any passengers in her car, Dorsey said.\nDorsey said that investigators do not believe the deputy’s pursuit of Griffin was a factor in the crash. Because Griffin had been drinking, investigators do not believe he was aware there was a sheriff’s unit behind him, Dorsey said."

Under the inspirational guidance of Denise Deluca, co-founder and director of Biomimicry for Creative Innovation (BCI), this work ultimately grew from my Master's thesis project.\nMy design concept was a water treatment system called SolDrop. My team went on to become the only US finalists in the global 2013 BSDC and I had the honor of presenting at the Biomimicry Education Summit and Global Conference in Boston that year.\nUpon first looking to Mother Nature as a mentor, I started with getting curious while walking through a coastal forest in Oregon. I wanted to know how the clouds were forming in the forest and if I could glean insight into water management strategies. After a quick search on AskNature.org, I discovered that pine needles use the strategy of high surface area to perform the function of collecting moisture.\nDozens of searches and many design iterations later, I learned that nature performs multiple functions using various strategies on all surface-, structure-, and systems-levels. Similar to the pine needles, an elephant's wrinkly skin and several desert plants, use the strategy of high surface area, to perform varied functions. Amongst these multi-functional strategies I found several patterns that occurred across many biological organisms.\nThe biomimetic design idea, SolDrop, is based on the concept of using several modular solar distillation \"pods,\" in a decentralized fashion, to provide a water treatment option that may be affordable for people in impoverished areas. Ideally, SolDrop solar still \"pods\" are made from recycled plastic bottles or other locally available materials that can be found and maintained locally, and used to purify water in someone's home.\nBy integrating several bio-inspired strategies and practicing the methods of biomimicry (as applied to design), I went from having an inspiration-level understanding to gaining a deep understanding of biomimicry thinking as a problem-solving framework. This led to continued'ah-ha's' in how I might create a sustainable product innovation and a social enterprise that enriches the ecosystem with good business.\nIn retrospect, I took far more away from studying, practicing and making biomimicry thinking a part of my daily habits than I had ever anticipated. Initially I thought I'd just be tackling the product as a designer, but soon shifted to creating a water treatment option that also engages local communities and enhances local economies for long-term positive impact.\nThis article is part of a mini-series about a young industrial designer's experiences bringing a sustainability-focus to her work entitled \"Aspiring to Improve the World by Crafting a Career in Sustainable Design.\""

        "text": "North Carolina Democrats made a lot of progress last night in winning back seats long held by Republicans, but there was one clear factor that prevented a sizable “blue wave” from truly transforming state politics: partisan gerrymandering. We’ve known for years that Republican majorities in the General Assembly and the state’s congressional delegation have far exceeded the size of their actual support in a closely divided “purple” state, but last night’s results really brought that fact home again.\nThis was most obvious in the state’s 13 congressional districts where the total vote was almost dead even, despite the presence of nine extremely well-funded Republican incumbents and one race — the third district — in which Democrats didn’t even field a candidate. In the 12 contested races, the vote total thus far shows Republicans winning 1,642,344 votes or about 48.5% while Democrats won 1,747,742 or around 51.5%. Yet, despite this impressive performance, Democrats only won three of the 12 seats.\nI’ve yet to add up all of the numbers, but a preliminary glance at legislative races reveals what appears to be a similar pattern: Republicans will still enjoy sizable majorities almost exclusively because of partisan gerrymandering.\nThe bottom line: Gerrymandering continue to remain a toxic and dangerous plague upon our democracy. Its elimination (and the adoption of a nonpartisan redistricting system) must remain at the top of the policy priority list for all caring and thinking people.\nWhile I agree gerrymandering is disgraceful, even gerrymandering has little effect when you have such low voter turnouts. Being retired from public service, I remember people telling me I better be registered a certain party or I probably wouldn’t be hired. The older employees had lived by that system of changing their party affiliation on paper but not in actual vote. Does that affect gerrymandering?\nIt wasn’t struck down by the Supreme Court. They had chances last year in Gill v. Whitford (Wisconsin) and Abbott v. Perez (Texas) but they sent Wisconsin back to the lower courts with a lamer standard (ditto North Carolina) and they just let Texas stand because they are conservative bigoted liars. You don’t have to take MY word for that — it was 5-4 so at least 4 esteemed constitutional scholars concur in that judgment."

        "text": "One of the byproducts of being around a narcissist for any significant portion of time is that you end up feeling a deep sense of self-loathing. This can be true in any category of relationship, such as intimate partner, parent-child, boss-employee, sibling, co-worker, or any other type of relationship involving an ongoing interaction with a narcissist.\nIf you are the child of a narcissist, you believe your parent(s) love you because they take care of you, right? They clean the house, take you to school, feed you dinner, and buy you clothes. You even have structure and rules to abide by. No one is hitting you or touching you in inappropriate ways. You live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood. But, in spite of all of these blessings and signs of care, inside you feel a deep sense of shame. Why is this?\nAnd when you aren’t experiencing all of their projected disdain, contempt, and disgust, there’s always the envy to contend with. The envy isn’t usually directed at you, it is usually felt toward others, those not in your narcissist’s family. The narcissist is usually very envious of other people – the ones who have “good” children and spouses. Your narcissist will feel very sorry for him or herself for having to deal with his or her disappointing and lousy family, believing that if only s/he had a better spouse or different children, ones that could deliver, then s/he would be happy. As you observe and experience your narcissistic loved one comparing you to others and feeling wanting, you, by implication, take on the obvious understanding that you are an inadequate failure.\nWhy do narcissists particularly enjoy the emotions of disgust, contempt, disdain, and envy? Let’s dissect the former three emotions first, because they are all quite similar and projected outward in a judgmental way towards other people. Think about when you feel disgusted toward something or someone. Don’t you feel that you are in the non-disgusting position, capable of welding the “disgust” label outside of yourself? Don’t you feel in some ways above whatever it is you don’t like?\nThink about the emotions of contempt and disdain for a minute. When you feel contemptuous toward someone, on the one hand you are angry with the target of your contempt, and on the other hand you are superior to that which is contemptuous. The same applies to the emotion of disdain. When your narcissistic loved one is displaying either overtly or covertly the emotions of contempt or disdain toward you, then he or she is obviously in the one-up position, smug and superior, able to impute judgments on you, the target of the projected feelings.\nThere are probably two main reasons that narcissists so often feel these contemptuous and negative emotions. One, is because someone in their youth (probably one or both of their parents did the same thing to them) projected this emotion on to them, and, in addition, he/she (the parent) “imprinted” this type of behavioral expression of negative emotions onto them (monkey see, monkey do,) which they replicated in adulthood.\nThe second explanation for this type of emotional display is due to projected shame and rage. The narcissist, incapable of experiencing any depth of vulnerability, projects his/her shame and rage outwards onto certain targets in order to not have to “carry’ his/her shame and rage within him/herself. This projection sometimes takes on the form of disdain, disgust, and contempt. Targets, not realizing what is happening, serve in the capacity of garbage dumps for their loved ones projected toxicity.\nWhat role does envy play in the lives of narcissists? It serves as a constant symbolic scapegoat of why narcissists feel so empty. Because narcissist’s have an inability to self-reflect, they use over-compensatory coping strategies in order to feel okay about themselves. Envy is a very useful tool because it serves to convince narcissists that their problems do not exist within themselves, but reside in their failing loved ones’ inabilities to perform to their satisfaction.\nThis is why when you are around a narcissist for any significant length of time you feel a deep sense of self-loathing. Your narcissist has unwittingly brain-washed you with toxic shame interspersed with inconsistent bouts of normalcy. Your person does not have to blatantly tell you you’re a failure, you figure that out yourself by your inability to make him or her happy and satisfied. After all, if you were sufficient, your narc wouldn’t be experiencing disdain, disgust, contempt, or envy.\nThe dangerous web you get caught up in is the web of thinking that somehow if you can just figure out how to be “enough” for the other person, then he or she will be happy. The first step toward breaking out of this toxicity is to understand that you already are enough. The problem resides inside the other person and has absolutely nothing to do with you. You need to tell yourself and convince yourself that YOU CANNOT MAKE A NARCISSIST HAPPY. PERIOD. So you might as well stop trying."

        "text": "Shelagh Delaney, the acclaimed playwright whose ground-breaking debut, A Taste of Honey, challenged many of the taboos of 50s Britain, has died. She was 71 and had been suffering from cancer.\nThe feisty Salford-born writer, who drew on the gritty reality of working-class life, was one of the pioneers of the \"kitchen sink\" realism movement of the late 1950s and 1960s.\nShe was just 19 when A Taste of Honey premiered in 1958 and became an instant success, with runs in London and New York. An earthy and moving story of a teenage girl's pregnancy following a one-night stand with a black sailor, and her supportive relationship with a gay artist, it would become one of the defining feminist plays of the 1950s.\nIt was subsequently turned into a film, starring Rita Tushingham and earning Delaney and the film's director, Tony Richardson, Bafta and Writer's Guild awards for best screenplay.\nTushingham told the Guardian: \"Shelagh was such an important person at the start of my career. I am deeply saddened that we have lost such an amazing talent.\"\nJane Villiers, Delaney's agent for the last 15 years, told Channel 4: \"No word was wasted. Every word meant something. She was extraordinarily accurate about characters.\"\nThe daughter of a bus inspector of Irish descent, Delaney wrote A Taste of Honey, aged just 18, after seeing and disliking Terence Rattigan's play Variation on a Theme, partly because she felt his work showed insensitivity in the way it portrayed homosexuality.\nShe wrote it in two weeks, adapting it from a novel she was already working on. Her second play, The Lion in Love, which portrayed an impoverished family and a difficult marriage, did not enjoy the same critical success when it opened in 1960. She did not write for the theatre again until 1979, when she revised her BBC series The House that Jack Built.\nIn between she wrote screenplays: The White Bus (1965), Charlie Bubbles (1967), The Raging Moon (1970), and the screenplay for the 1985 film Dance with a Stranger, based on the story of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for a crime in Britain.\nDriven, in part, by rebellion against a theatre which, she claimed, did not portray \"life as the majority of ordinary people know it\", she found a vitality in Salford that infused her writing. \"The language is alive, it's virile, it lives and it breathes and you know exactly where it's coming from. Right out of the earth,\" she said in a 1960 film by Ken Russell. \"Down by the river it's even romantic, if you can stand the smell.\"\nAcknowledging her as an inspiration, the author Jeanette Winterson has said Delaney's talent had been allowed to fade because of her gender. \"She was like a lighthouse – pointing the way and warning about the rocks underneath. She was the first working-class woman playwright,\" Winterson wrote in the Guardian last year. \"She had all the talent and we let her go.\"\nThe singer Morrissey frequently referenced her writing in his lyrics, particularly in the song This Night Has Opened My Eyes, and her face appeared on the cover of The Smiths' compilation album Louder Than Bombs and single Girlfriend in a Coma. The Beatles were also said to be fans, recording their own version of the theme from the film adaptation of A Taste Of Honey."

        "text": "On Nov. 8, American voters for the first time in history will see a woman’s name on the ballot as a major party’s nominee for president. A broad majority of voters — men and women — say they are happy this milestone has been reached, but fully half of them say they would have preferred that that first woman not be Hillary Clinton, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.\nThe poll looked closely at women’s political views and broader outlook on American life, as well as how the wider society views the role of women. The survey found that women think more progress has been made toward ending sexism than racism in society. They value motherhood more than marriage. They think that sexual harassment is a significant issue in the workplace. And they think the greatest problem facing American women is inequality in pay and career opportunities.\nMrs. Clinton is supported by 52 percent of women likely to vote in November, while 39 percent back Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump’s problems with women are significant: 55 percent of female respondents say he does not respect women and about half think a Trump presidency would be bad for women. Only 11 percent think electing him would be good for women, while 45 percent of women say Mrs. Clinton’s election would benefit them.\nMrs. Clinton’s nomination has done little to reverse women’s perceptions of gender discrimination in America, and in many cases, their views differ sharply from men’s.\nForty-eight percent of women — but just 35 percent of men — think there are more advantages in being a man than in being a woman in society today. Majorities of women with a college degree, those who identify as Democrats, those younger than 30, those with household incomes of at least $100,000, and black women all say men hold an advantage.\nAsked to name the most important problem facing women today, women cited issues related to gender inequality in the workplace, primarily pay, more than any other. Gender divisions were particularly pronounced on issues related to the workplace. Three-quarters of women said women in the United States are paid less than men doing similar work, while 55 percent of men held the same opinion.\nWomen were also more likely than men to say there is “a lot” of sexual harassment in most American workplaces today — fully one-quarter said so, compared with 18 percent of men. But the same number of men and women, 53 percent, acknowledge that there is “some.” Younger women and African-American women are most likely to say there is a lot of sexual harassment.\nA poll of women conducted for Virginia Slims in 1994 found virtually the same result: Three-quarters of women said there was some sexual harassment or a lot in the workplace.\nBy a ratio of almost two to one — 51 percent to 27 percent — American women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years.\nBut Joyce Coleman, an African-American from Southfield, Mich., and a retired human resources consultant, said in a follow-up interview that there had been less progress toward ending sexism.\nThe nationwide poll was conducted from Sept. 9 through 13 on landlines and cellphones with 1,770 adults and has an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.\nMen are significantly more likely than women to see themselves as ever being leaders in business or government. Nearly half of men say they could achieve this while less than a third of women do. African-American women are much more likely than white women to see themselves as leaders (40 percent versus 26 percent). Likewise, women younger than 45 and those with more education or higher incomes are the more likely than other women to think this high level of leadership is achievable.\nCarla Lytle, a 52-year-old African-American, manages election officials at the Election Commission in Shelby County, Tenn., and is one of the survey participants who sees herself as a leader.\nWomen rate success at work as much more important than their appearance in determining how they feel about themselves, but significantly more think that society places a higher emphasis on looks than on their success at work. Fifty-three percent of women say their appearance is very important in how they view themselves, while 71 percent say society judges them by their physical appearance. African-American women are far more likely to rate their appearance as very important.\nFifty-six percent of women think Mrs. Clinton is a good role model for women. By contrast, in 2007, during her first campaign for the presidency, a Times/CBS News poll found that 70 percent considered her a good role model.\nWilla Speiser, 68, a freelance editor in Warwick, N.Y., plans to vote for her but does not consider her a role model.\nThe poll looked closely at women’s political views and broader outlook on American life, as well as how the wider society views the role of women.\nSignificantly more men than women consider marriage to be very important. While 58 percent of men said being married is very important, just 47 percent of women overall said so.\nMost women with household incomes over $100,000, those who identify as Republicans and those between the ages of 30 and 45 said marriage is very important to them. But in roughly equal numbers (almost three-quarters), both men and women said being a parent was very important to them. Women under the age of 30 were least likely to rate parenthood as very important, but still, 59 percent hold this belief.\nDalia Sussman, Giovanni Russonello and Marina Stefan contributed reporting."

Phillips presented them with financial awards.\nMember of Parliament Peter Phillips has advised the top Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) students from the Maxfield Park division of his St Andrew East Central constituency to be wary of peer pressure.\nPhillips, who is also the leader of Opposition, was speaking to the students and their parents at a luncheon held in Kingston during the weekend. The 10 students were each awarded an undisclosed sum of money to assist with back-to-school preparation.\n\"Don't follow people; because a crowd is doing it, that doesn't mean it is right,\" Phillips advised the students.\n\"I remember when I was much younger than you, a group of students said they were going to steal out of school early, and I know it didn't make any sense, but I followed them, and a girl who was in the group got hit by a car while she was running across the road,\" he recounted.\n\"That taught me from then to follow my conscience. That voice inside of you that says,'No, don't do this.' Listen to that voice,\" said Phillips.\nThe students, with averages from 69-96 per cent, and who listed zoologist and mathematician among their future career choices, were advised by Phillips to attain at least five passes at the Caribbean Secondary Education Certifi-cation level, including mathematics and English, to achieve their goals.\nPhillips also encouraged parents to have an open relationship with their children and to participate as much as they could in their high-school journey.\n\"They really need a friend, and a guide that they can say anything to. The worst thing is for them to feel alone and as if they have no one, because they might turn to the wrong person.\n\"A child needs to know that you care. So, when they call for parent-teacher meeting, go to the meeting. Be involved in your child's life. Ensure homework is done, and be in touch with their teachers,\" counselled Phillips."

The report says there hasn't been a formal offer put on the table yet, though Mayer has met several top-Hulu execs to see how the video site would tie into Yahoo's existing comeback plan.\nThe move to make a video acquisition is nothing new for Yahoo, which tried to purchase a $300 million majority stake in France Télécom’s Dailymotion video service earlier in the year and was rejected by a regulatory official who didn't want the company to move out of France.\nThe acquisition of Hulu would be big for the company. Under Mayer's leadership, which begun in the summer of 2012, Yahoo has begun snatching up several smaller mobile companies as it works to increase its presence on mobile. The acquisitions have led to a beautiful new Yahoo Weather app and a redesign of the Yahoo app to include Summly tech.\nIn recent months Yahoo has also begun focusing more on video, as it announced last month it will have exclusive right to a slew of Saturday Night Live clips to host on its site. Hulu's video content would play nicely with Yahoo's plans to offer \"original content alongside a larger tranche of curated content from across the web\".\nIf Yahoo is serious about its Hulu bid, it had better be ready to bring the cash. The company has previously been valued at around $2 billion, considering its 2012 revenue topped $700 million.\nWe'll be on the look out to see if the Yahoo/Hulu deal materialises. Given AllThingsD's usually very spot-on sources, this sounds real."

        "text": "The storm we're bracing for is the type of January variety everyone prepares for: monitor school closings, check flashlights and stock up on bread, eggs and milk.\nIt's hard to know exactly how any storm will hit until it actually arrives. But there's a foreboding sense about what to expect in the coming days.\n\"We had something comparable in January 2014,\" said Aaron Reynolds, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo.\nThat storm launched Buffalo's first official blizzard in 21 years at the time.\nReynolds stopped just short of predicting this week would yield the same designation, but he left open the possibility.\n\"It's too early to tell,\" Reynolds said. \"It's not out of the realm of possibility.\"\nThe January 2014 blizzard started with a blast of frigid polar air that dropped temperatures from 45 degrees to 2 degrees in a single day. It brought wild, gusty winds over 50 mph, subzero temperatures and wind chills colder than 40 degrees below zero. And, it brought 17.6 inches of snow that spanned Jan. 6-8, 2014.\nLike it did then, weather service headlines for this week herald the coming of a \"very dangerous and life-threatening Arctic air mass.\"\nThe polar blast is expected to rush behind a passing cold front Tuesday, and in combination with a southwesterly flow over the still relatively open waters of Lake Erie, it will help ripen and fuel a strong lake-effect snowstorm, forecasters said. Subzero temperatures, strong winds and brutally cold wind chills are also forecast.\nA winter storm warning for Erie, Genesee and Wyoming counties starts at 4 p.m. Tuesday and is scheduled to run through Thursday morning.\nAs of late Monday, the weather service estimated snow totals are likely to be upward of 18 inches in the areas most persistently affected by the lake-effect bands. That's on top of the roughly 20 inches of snow that fell in metro Buffalo last week.\nForecasters said winds could gust as high as 45 mph late Wednesday through Thursday and \"may produce near blizzard conditions with severe blowing and drifting snow.\"\n\"Travel could be very difficult to impossible,\" the weather service said.\nHigh temperatures on Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the single digits with overnight lows Wednesday below zero. Wind chills as low as minus 25 are possible in metro Buffalo. They could be even colder in other parts of the region.\n\"The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 15 minutes,\" the weather service said.\nAlthough the frigid temperatures are expected to hasten freezing on Lake Erie – which has been lingering at 32 degrees for a week – it's not likely to happen fast enough to avert cranking up the lake-effect machine, according to Don Paul, a contributor to The Buffalo News.\n\"As for the growing ice cover, the freezing of Lake Erie isn’t like popping an ice cube tray into your home freezer. It takes time,\" Paul wrote Monday. \"It happens faster when winds are light. That will not be the case until Friday at the earliest. Strong winds, like strong currents in a stream, slow the icing process.\"\nBuffalo's last \"official blizzard\" came Jan. 2, 2018. It lasted four hours.\nSo, how to get ready?\nKeeping a battery-operated lantern or battery-powered flashlights.\nHaving a battery-operated radio handy for important news and emergency announcements.\nCharging your mobile phone – and any portable chargers.\nMaking sure prescription drug needs are met.\nStocking baby food, water, canned foods, a first-aid kit and food you don't have to cook like dried fruit and crackers.\nMeanwhile, area school superintendents said they would monitor conditions closely.\nIn Buffalo, district spokesperson Elena Cala said in an emailed statement that because most students are \"walkers\" – either to the bus stop or to their school – the district is especially mindful of dangerous weather conditions.\n\"The decision of whether or not to close schools is based on New York State Department of Education guidance,\" Cala said. \"When the National Weather Service issues wind chill advisories between -15 and -25 degrees, the Buffalo Public Schools will strongly consider closing.\"\n\"We'll probably wait until Tuesday evening to make a decision,\" Laurrie said. \"We don’t want to go too early. Things have been known to change.\"\nSo, how \"historic\" do forecasters think this week's storm will turn out to be?\n\"I wouldn't go'once in a generation event,' or anything like that,\" Reynolds said. \"It's definitely a significant event.\"\nNews staff reporters Samantha Christmann and Barbara O'Brien contributed to this report."

        "text": "Location-based advertising (LBA) and marketing (LBM) could be of great benefit to local merchants, though there are some things that need to happen before widescale adoption of mobile campaigns will come about. Primarily, merchants need to know why mobile campaigns are beneficial to themselves and their target market, how to measure return on investment, and have access to smartphone owners regardless of application, device, or mobile platform.\nFor years, merchants have reached local customers through local daily and weekly print publications and other traditional media channels. However, with the growing number of smartphone users and the decrease of consumer use of print and other traditional media, merchants need another way to reach their target market. In many ways, smartphones and mobile devices such as the Apple iPad are an even better way to reach local customers, offering the ability for short-term, time-sensitive, location-based offers.\nConsider that mobile advertising is expected to be $7B+ market in the next four years, with LBA potentially having a significant slice of that. TheWhereBusiness.com outlined some of the current problems hampering LBA’s growth, with one of the biggest being the relative lack of smartphone users to target. Be sure to take note of their explanation outlining the difference between LBA and LBM. This post, since it focuses only on local merchants, refers to a more general grouping of mobile campaign services, say LBAM (Location-Based Advertising and Marketing), as local merchants are less likely to make a distinction between the two terms.\nSure, there are a growing number of smartphone owners out there, but how many of them are using LBS (Location-Based Services) — aka location-sharing — apps such as Foursquare, MyTown, Gowalla, and dozens of others? There are many reasons people do not use location-sharing apps, including there really being no incentive to, beyond amusement. Why would merchants want to spend money on campaigns with little or no audience? Other issues that limit merchant use of LBAM include the lack of standards for running mobile campaigns, and the means of measuring ROI.\nCreate mobile campaign bellwethers. Applying the “law of least resistance” that humans tend to follow means that the average merchant is not going to adopt LBAM campaigns just because they can. They need to see the value. Someone or some group has to be a bellwether and define standards and metrics, create methods of measurement, define best-practices for mobile campaigns, run some successful campaigns, and then educate and influence anyone who can help propagate these standards. Then and only then will merchants start to buy into LBAM with confidence. When merchants start to make useful offers via mobile devices that appeal to consumers, word of mouth will also help spread the reasons for consumers to use LBS apps. E.g., most merchants know what a loss-leader is, when you offer something at a loss in a sale, in hopes of selling a shopper something at a greater profit margin. If merchants knew how to do that via mobile devices, they and consumers would both benefit.\nAgnostic channels: aggregation of apps and smartphone owners. Merchants want to reach consumers. They don’t care which phone, mobile platform or LBS app a consumer is using. Otherwise there’s just too much fragmentation. App-specificity might be part of Location-Based Marketing, but I think it’s a bad idea from a local merchant point of view. Maybe if LBS apps developers teamed up to follow some open standards, a merchant would not have to create diffferent campaigns for different LBS apps.\nConsolidate ad networks. As with device/ app fragmentation, there’s a similar problem with merchants having to deal with multiple networks. Ideally, merchants should just be able to go through some sort of mobile ads brokerage (maybe MobClix) that is platform- and ad network-agnostic in the sense that running campaigns become simplicity: setup your ad specifications, content and campaign details, then publish and measure. The less fragmentation of target market that merchants have access to, the sooner they’re likely to adopt LBAM campaigns.\nIt’s not clear whether any of these “necesssities” are likely to happen anytime soon. Several big players, including Google and Apple, have their fingers in the mobile advertising pie and like to define things on their own terms. There are some consolidations of networks and companies going on in the LBA space, which might be ultimately beneficial. On a side note, based on recent patents that have been granted, namely iGroups and Concert Ticketing +, Apple seems to stand the best chance of implementing some powerful LBAM features into their iPhone platform, possibly via the recently announced iAds platform."

        "text": "Tanya Plibersek, Health Minister and staunch Julia Gillard supporter, provides gives her take on the coming ALP leadership ballot.\nCHRIS UHLMANN, PRESENTER: Joining me is one of Julia Gillard's staunch supporters, Health Minister Tanya Plibersek.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK, HEALTH MINISTER: Hi, Chris.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: You've just heard what Robert McClelland had to say. He's one of a number in your caucus who believes that this party is doomed under Julia Gillard. Under all the available evidence, isn't that correct?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think \"doomed\" is very emotive language. I think we have been having a tough time electorally, but certainly the sort of distraction that we've seen over the last few days doesn't help that. I think we've got an excellent record to talk about and we've got a clear vision for the future. And I hope that on Monday, if this ballot goes ahead, that there is a decisive victory and then we can all go back to doing what we went into Parliament to do, which is serve our communities.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: But you can't convince the community that that's what you're doing, that you are a good government. You can't even convince, it would appear, one third of your own caucus and that surely is disastrous.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well, you're picking numbers out of the air, Chris, so I don't think you can just assume numbers here or there. But, the real issue is that we've been talking about ourselves for much too long. I think - I think we need to sort this matter out on Monday. Julia Gillard has said that if she's not successful on Monday, she'll go to the backbench. I think it's very important that we get a clear statement also from Kevin Rudd that if he should not be successful in a ballot on Monday, that he will accept that his caucus colleagues have made a decision and he will work as part of a team to get our message across, get out the fact that we've done phenomenally well coming out of the Global Financial Crisis, get out the fact that we need to keep our economy strong so that we can build a fairer society.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: But you've just seen what Robert McClelland had to say and we've heard what Bruce Hawker had to say last night. It's quite obvious that the Rudd camp believes that if it gets close enough this time, that's just the start. This could go on for months.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: What do you think it would do?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK:.... and, most importantly, what it would do to good government in this country, our ability to deliver for the people that we care about. We've got this huge agenda for the future. We've just released the Gonski Report. We want to engage with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In my own area, I've got a dental report coming out next week. We want to do better on dental health care. These are the things that matter for people.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Certainly. And all of that would be trashed though, wouldn't it - all of that would be trashed by a continuing leadership crisis in the Labor Party and that's what's being promised.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: There must not be a continuing leadership crisis. We must sort this out on Monday that. That must be the end of it, because our record is not getting out, our successes are not making an impact on people, and, more importantly, our plans for the future are being lost in these internal discussions, and Labor Party supporters, Labor Party members, members of the labour movement need to hear us talking about what we're going to do, our vision for the future.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Members of the labour movement would be in despair at the moment, wouldn't they? They would think that this generation of Labor politicians may well be ending the long history of the Labor Party.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think there'd be very strong support for us sorting this out on Monday and then getting on with governing.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Was Kevin Rudd as damaging and destructive and dysfunctional as everyone now says? And if so, why didn't you say so at the time?\nCHRIS UHLMANN: You were a closer observer than anyone else.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK:.... ministry. No, I'm not gonna pass judgment on people. I have plenty of my own personal failings, and what I do every day is get up and go to work and do the best job I can for the people that I care about that I want to serve. And I think a majority of my colleagues feel that way.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Well we have seen a number of cabinet ministers today, the Prime Minister on down, saying that this is the case. Doesn't that show that as a cabinet they were completely supine; they didn't actually speak up when things were going wrong?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think what the Prime Minister said very clearly today is that she worked her guts out to try and fix things that she believed needed fixing and she did it inside the cabinet processes, which is completely appropriate. In fact I don't think this sort of public blood-letting does any of us any good. I think it overshadows our great achievements and it overshadows our plans for the future, and really, that's what people wanna hear about.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: With everything that we've heard though over the last little while, and we're going to hear a lot more over the course weekend as people try to bludgeon support one way or the other in caucus, how can you possibly unite after this and convince the people that you have united?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well, I am confident we can. You know, we just heard from Robert McClelland who has - you know, said in his interview that he takes a different position from me. I like and respect Robert and I will have no trouble working with him on Monday afternoon, no matter what the outcome of this is. And I truly believe that the vast majority of my colleagues want what's best for the Australian people, and what's best for the Australian people is that we are able to complete the work that we have done.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Very briefly, could you work in a Kevin Rudd cabinet?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: I've worked with Kevin before, I've served him loyally, but I must say I believe that Julia Gillard delivered - delivered the Minerals Resources Rent Tax, a price on carbon, we've now got education reform, disability insurance scheme. She has delivered complex and difficult reform in a very - extraordinarily difficult parliamentary environment.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Tanya Plibersek, we'll have to leave it there. Thankyou."

Instead, it fueled her career and brought her to the attention of David Foster.\nMcPhee’s sophomore release, appropriately titled “Unbroken,” was released last week. The singer is currently on the roster of Verve Forecast Records, a division of Universal Music Group.\nMcPhee became a household name on Season 5 of “American Idol.” Week by week she improved her style, but her vocals set her apart. She was definitely meant to be a singer. Her fate to win was cut short when Taylor Hicks beat her out.\nNeither Hicks nor McPhee did as well commercially as anticipated.\nI liked both of their debut CDs, but it was obvious their music wasn’t as authentic as their performances on “AI.” I don’t blame either one for that. Both are talented performers and nice people. I’ve met them both.\nMcPhee’s self-titled debut was good, but its sales were lackluster — not the kind of punch RCA hoped for.\nHopefully, “Unbroken” will change things for McPhee. Upon first listen of the new disc, it was clear to me her time spent with Foster transformed her from a girl who made a splash on TV into an amazing singer who believes in what she’s doing.\n“Unbroken” contains 12 tracks, six co-written by McPhee, and a bonus track guaranteed to make you smile. She shares songwriting credits with such people as \"Idol\" judge Kara DioGuardi, Rachael Yamagata, Ingrid Michaelson and Paula Cole. The music is a nice blend of pop, rock and country all rolled into one – if you’re a fan of crossover artists like Taylor Swift, Mandy Moore or Carrie Underwood, you’ll like McPhee.\nTracks that definitely pop out and say “listen to me” include “Keep Drivin’,” “Had It All” and “Surrender.” They showcase an almost different side of McPhee, a vulnerable side some would say was missing before now.\nSomething that’s been there all along has been her vocal abilities. She can sing, crystal clear and very well. The song “How” is amazing and should become a massive hit for McPhee. Verve Forecast would be stupid not to make this song a single. It’s a “10” in every way: lyrics, style, vocals and presentation.\n“How” is the kind of song someone like Martina McBride or Celine Dion would sing and take it to the top. The only thing is we don’t need them to do that; McPhee nailed it herself.\nThe title track, along with “Anybody’s Heart” and “Faultline,” are touching ballads, as is the song “Terrified,” where McPhee is paired up with country singer Jason Reeves.\nThe song “Lifetime” is a cutesy little number she has fun with, but no song on the album is more fun than the bonus track “Brand New Key” made famous in the early ’70s by Melanie. What a great song and a nice addition to an already great album.\nDavid T. Farr is a Journal (Sturgis, Mich.) correspondent. E-mail him at farrboy@hotmail.com."

Although the U.S. Catholic bishops have convoked this gathering of Catholic leaders from across the U.S. and its territories to promote unity in proclaiming the Gospel, all the participants are there to learn from the experiences and insights of Catholic leaders in more than 300 organizations that are trying to spread the Gospel at the local level.\nJonathan Reyes, executive director of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Department of Justice, Peace and Human Development, told the Register that the event seeks to strengthen the “apostolic vision” of the Church by bringing its leadership together for this one-time event.\nThe idea of the convocation originated in the U.S. bishops’ Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities and the Department of Justice, Peace, and Human Development and has been in the making for more than seven years, Reyes explained. However, Pope Francis’ Evangelii Gaudium provided the needed push to put this plan into action.\n“Evangelii Gaudium was the sort of key moment, with this sense that the Church, facing the challenges of the age, was just called to missionary discipleship, encountering Christ, and [the need] to try to do something that was never done before,” he said.\nThe convocation is by invitation only. All the U.S. Catholic bishops have chosen Catholic leaders for their diocesan delegations.\nApproximately 160 out of 197 dioceses, eparchies and ordinariates are sending delegations, with an average of 10 delegates accompanying their bishop. The Archdiocese of Cincinnati is sending the most delegates, 52 persons, while the eight delegates for the Romanian Catholic Eparchy of St. George’s in Canton, Ohio, represent the greatest ratio of delegates proportional to flock size. With its 6,200 Catholics, that’s one delegate for every 775 Catholics.\nThe USCCB also disbursed more than $500,000 in scholarships to make sure the personal and geographic diversity of the Church, along with insights and contributions, was represented, including African-American and Native-American Catholics, low-income attendees and “Catholic Home Missions” dioceses.\nSome attendees are coming from as far away as the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.\nThe USCCB has also invited more than 160 Catholic organizations, covering a wide variety of Catholic-led ministries, apostolates and movements, dedicated to advancing the mission of the Church, Reyes said.\nThe convocation features 66 breakout sessions, covering a wide variety of themes in the Church. Reyes said the sessions are off the record, so people in the Church can have a frank and open conversation about where the Church is advancing and failing and how to create effectively a Church of missionary disciples.\nEach delegation will have to strategically choose which breakout sessions its members wish to attend over the three days. However, the convocation will provide plenty of opportunities for networking to establish relationships with other Catholic leaders to continue gathering ideas and strategizing how to put them into action.\nAll the public events — such as the public presentations, Mass and prayer services — will be televised with commentary on EWTN, the Register’s parent company, so Catholics at home can experience part of the event.\nDiocesan and organizational delegations will then have the task of disseminating the fruits of what they’ve acquired to the local parish and community level.\nSherry Weddell, author of Forming Intentional Disciples and a convocation presenter, told the Register that the real opportunity for the conference will be networking.\nDelegates will not be going to find “silver bullets,” because each of their circumstances is different. But the breakout sessions and presentations will help start ideas and get the conversation going, meaning the real work — putting conversation into action — will be after the gathering. The convocation itself represents a real change in the U.S. Church she has seen gaining steam recently — going from a maintenance to a missionary attitude.\nEvangelii Gaudium, she said, built on the call for missionary disciples honed by Blessed Paul VI, St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, and the majority of the bishops have taken it to heart.\n“The conversation has changed so dramatically in the last five years,” said Weddell.\nThe delegation from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, one of the main sponsors of the convocation, has been preparing for the event by studying Evangelii Gaudium together.\nKathleen Buckley Domingo, associate director of the diocesan Office of Life, Justice and Peace, told the Register they have drawn their delegation from Catholics in the chancery, parishes and other organizations that reflect the diversity of Catholic ministries in L.A. — such as pro-life, homeless and immigration ministries — but also from different ages, socioeconomic backgrounds and cultures.\nDomingo said they are looking forward to learning “new ideas and new approaches” from others on evangelization, since they have to fight a wide variety of attacks on human life and dignity.\nAt the same time, she said the archdiocese hopes to contribute its own experience of how having people engaged in life, justice and peace-building, “united for the glory of God,” can deliver a more effective witness.\nThe Diocese of Las Vegas is just 20 years old, but Connie Clough, director of faith formation, said they look forward to learning from similarly situated Catholic dioceses and eparchies about how they have effectively used their size and resources to proclaim the Gospel.\nClough said they are looking forward to learning the perspective of the Eastern Churches — delegations are coming from the Ruthenian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Melkite, Maronite, Syro-Malabar and Armenian Catholic eparchies in the U.S.\nLas Vegas’ largest parish has 8,000 families, and its smallest missions have 25 families. But Clough thinks they will bring back new knowledge and networked contacts from the convocation and also a model for collaboration and learning between the diocese’s parishes and Catholic organizations.\nThe Archdiocese of New York has drawn its delegation from chancery staff, but also a “broad swath” of religious and lay Catholics involved in ministries in the field, according to Daniel Frascella, the archdiocese’s director of adult faith formation.\nNew York is known for its rich cultural and ethnic diversity, and Frascella said the archdiocese wants to see what “best practices” it can learn from others on how to communicate the Gospel in these different contexts, since their parishes also include rural, suburban and urban communities.\nFrascella said the archdiocese is working on a plan to reconvene their 40 delegates after the convocation, discuss their takeaways, and consider how they can implement them practically in their ministries for the local Church.\nJaime Maldonado, a Connecticut seminarian with the Archdiocese of Hartford’s delegation, told the Register he is looking forward to learning how to engage more effectively with the “Nones” — the large segment of the U.S. population that no longer identifies as Christian — particularly millennials. Maldonado, 38, who has a scientific background — before seminary, he was a neuroscientist at Yale — said many times he was asked during his postdoctoral fellowship how he could believe in God and be a scientist.\nMaldonado admitted his answers at the time were “not eloquent,” and he looks forward to learning from others in the breakout sessions about how the Church can provide a better witness in this area. It is critical for reaching out to millennials, many of whom seem to have the view that science and faith are incompatible.\nThe “Convocation of Catholic Leaders” provides an excellent opportunity to get the Church in alignment for the challenge of proclaiming the Gospel in the 21st century, according to Curtis Martin, founder and CEO of the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS).\nBut Martin said the Church needs to recover its own story, particularly in how the Church has been successful in communicating through the culture in order to proclaim the Gospel and raise up a generation of disciples on fire for Jesus Christ — Christians who understood that their faith required a “completely radical response to the most radical event of human history.” Martin pointed to the Jesuit missionaries of North America, who learned the language and culture of the Native peoples and helped them spread the Gospel.\nHe pointed to the Huron martyr Joseph Chiwatenhwa and his wife, Marie Aonetta, who dedicated themselves to raising a family of saints and took the initiative as lay Catholics to spread the Gospel, supported by St. Jean de Brébeuf and the other Jesuit priests.\nThe witness of the Coptic martyrs in Egypt, who recently gave their lives for their faith, drove home for Martin the importance of cultivating this kind of discipleship.\nThis story was updated at 9:30am Eastern June 8, 2017.\nPublic portions of the event will be broadcast on EWTN and livestreamed online.

Siilo has suggested to District, Municipal and Metropolitan Assemblies to bear 25 percent cost of European Union (EU) Micro Projects for the effective implementation and execution of the projects.\nHe said the rationale behind taking up the cost on behalf of the beneficiary communities, was to alleviate them from economic difficulties.\nMr Siilo who was speaking to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at Agona Swedru on the success of EU Micro projects in the district said certain communities were facing serious financial and social problems, and needed to be helped.\nThe European Union bears 75 percent cost of the projects, while the beneficiary communities take up the remaining 25 percent. He said when the assemblies took up the full cost, as directed by the EU, the projects would be completed early.\nMr Siilo noted that the communities who are mostly farmers find it extremely difficult to make ends meet, and wondered how they could contribute to the project.\nThe DCD said the assemblies spend more funds before putting up a classroom or toilet, and wondered why they could not do the same thing in the EU Micro Projects to alleviate the suffering of beneficiary communities."

        "text": "A Jim Thorpe police officer who charged a borough man with escape testified yesterday that he never told the man he was under arrest or was being detained.\nPatrolman Stephen Shabazian admitted at a preliminary hearing that all he did Sept. 15 was ask Joseph Kennedy for his driver's license -- while Shabazian was sitting in his cruiser and Kennedy was walking by.\nDistrict Justice Edward Lewis of Jim Thorpe tossed out the escape charge and a summary offense of failing to produce a driver's license when asked. Lewis convicted Kennedy of driving on the wrong side of the road and imposed a $25 fine.\nShabazian, the only witness at the brief hearing, said that fellow Patrolman Robert Transue was driving the cruiser about 2 a.m. Sept. 15. Shabazian said he and Transue saw a step van cross the center line several times as it came up North Street.\nThe van turned and the driver parked at Kennedy's home. Transue pulled the cruiser alongside the van. Kennedy was out of the van, and Shabazian, while still inside the van, asked Kennedy for his driver's license. Kennedy said his license was inside the house, turned and walked away. Shabazian called out for Kennedy to forget about the license and asked for registration.\nKennedy continued walking toward his house. Shabazian did not follow or try to stop him.\nShabazian lost sight of Kennedy, but, several minutes later, knocked on a door at the Kennedy home. A young girl, who Shabazian said was Kennedy's daughter, answered and said her father was not home. The girl refused to allow Shabazian to search the house.\nHe told the girl to have her father call the police station when he got home.\nKennedy didn't reappear, but Shabazian stayed put until about 2:30 a.m. He searched Kennedy's van for Kennedy and \"for illegal paraphernalia,\" then left.\nOn Oct. 8, Shabazian went back to the Kennedy home. Kennedy produced a valid driver's license. Shabazian asked Kennedy to come to the police station to discuss the events of Sept. 15, but Kennedy declined when Shabazian said he didn't know whether criminal charges would be filed.\nShabazian on Oct. 12 filed the charges.\nKennedy's lawyer, Robert T. Yurchak, asked that the escape charge be dismissed because a person who has not been told he is being officially detained cannot escape. Lewis agreed.\nIn throwing out the failure to produce a license charge, Lewis said that although a person has 15 days in which to show that he has a valid license, Shabazian didn't go back to the Kennedy house for 23 days and didn't make clear whether Kennedy would be charged with a crime."

        "text": "The trade war between the US and China is taking an ugly turn. At the centre of the trade war between the two economy giants is the stealing of massive Intellectual Property (IP) of the US enterprises by the Chinese business firms and other dubious entities.\nIt is to be noted that irrespective of the current standoff between Washington and Beijing — starting from the Huawei to an incessant trade war to blocking of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the UN — US President Trump needs to be careful about the immediate consequences of falling apart with the $14trn worth Chinese economy at the moment.\nAmid claims and counter-claims by both Washington and Beijing, it is worth noting how both are veering around the IP issue and defending one another. For Trump Administration, making China listen and take necessary steps to curb sheer violations of IP rights that amounts to some good billions each year is the aim for now.\nFor President Trump, what is good for him is that a large business and political community in his country agree that China can spoil the global trading system in the long run. China’s steroidal State capitalist regime poses a serious threat to the current international business system.\nBut then, China strongly refuses such claims constantly made by both the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) and the European Union of Chamber of Commerce in China (European Chamber). Last year, China’s Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen publicly declared that accusations that China steals IPRs and forces technology transfers are sheer fabrications out of nothing and groundless.\nThe Xi regime has outrightly rejected US and EU allegations.\nIndeed, the Chinese Government says that it is keen on protecting IPRs and has already taken serious steps in doing so. Ironically, the AmCham China and European Chamber in their China business climate survey, ranked the IPR issue as the 12th and the 11th last year. But this has given fresh ammunition to Beijing to reclaim that if China had forced technological transfers, failed in IPR protection or even stolen IPRs, the concerned enterprises would have complained directly.\nIt has been constantly aired by the Government that in terms of IPR legislation, China has enacted adequate laws and regulations which are truly compliant to WTO directives.\nMeanwhile China has set up three IPR courts in Shanghai, Beijing and in Guanghou and special judicial branches in more than 15 cities to handle cross regional IP cases. This all is fine on official records. What makes foreign enterprises fighting IP issues see it is as a herculean task is to fight China’s opaque judicial system. And moreover, all these organs are party-controlled and cases are always bias either towards the locals or state owned enterprises.\nNow the question is how the Trump Administration will wade through this crisis and find a way out wherein; first, the interests of American enterprises are served, and second, most of the European and other corporate houses are well protected from the clutches of Xi’s new-found market socialism. Besides, as the presidential election fever is about to grip America, the President must bring an end to the current trade war between the US and China. Again, his team demands a robust public relations campaign to respond to the Opposition and special interest groups.\nContrary to what Xi proclaimed, he is turning all his efforts to mount a nationalist fervour so as to drum up continued support for strengthening the Communist Party at home and expansion of China’s shady deals abroad.\nIt must be noted here that when China joined the WTO in 2001, it clearly pledged not to demand technology transfer from the MNCs coming to operate inside as one of the prime conditions for market entry. Global experts say it is really difficult to make a case against China because it has generally observed by the letter of its WTO commitments.\nIn reality, what makes running business tricky in China is the indispensable role of the local partners that play on the global corporate houses. It has been noticed that from car manufacturing to cloud computing, only with the aid of the local agents and partners, the MNCs can make their business happen.\nWhen it comes to the project implementation level, the Chinese regulators demand methods of product testing and approval procedures which results in compelling the foreign companies to divulge their IP secrets in the process. Various global trade experts say the unstated goal behind the entire process is to help the Chinese companies getting easy access to foreign technology.\nBut then the Beijing smartly replies quite often that these business regulations and verification procedures are completely voluntary and are purely commercial agreements made between concerned MNCs and the Chinese Government.\nAnother serious problem that directly hits the foreign MNCs in China is the issue of “quojin mintui” (the State advances, the private sector retreats), particularly under the Xi Government. The Government and its banks systematically funnels cheap capitals towards these state owned firms at times at the cost of the advancement of the big corporate houses.\nSimply speaking, economic reforms if at all carried out by Xi, it would be a win-win situation for both China and America. However, looking at China’s poor global compliance records so far, Trump requires more manoeuvring tactics to encounter a recalcitrant Beijing administration either through tariffs or with the help of arbitration to save the treasured IPs of global giants."

But the details were not disclosed. A Gazprom spokeswoman would not comment.\nBrunei LNG is half-owned by Brunei, with Japanese group Mitsubishi and Anglo-Dutch company Shell each owning 25%.\nHowever, two sources close to Russia’s state-owned giant say Gazprom needs a guarantee of non-stop deliveries: in 2009 Gazprom set up subsidiary GM & T Singapore, which was intended to develop Russian gas deliveries to the promising Asian region.\nIt is actively searching for Asian customers, but Gazprom’s LNG resources are limited. Russia's only LNG plant, Gazprom-led Sakhalin-2, produces around 10 million tonnes a year.\nGazprom, and partners in the Shtokman project, Total and Statoil, have been struggling to work out a scheme to develop the huge Barents Sea field which holds more gas than all of Norway's continental shelf.\nHowever, Vedomosti cite documents that indicate that Gazprom’s Asian delivery commitments are set to be fulfilled \"primarily\" with Russian resources, and mining projects in the Asia-Pacific region, including in South Asia, can only serve as an \"additional resource base,\" especially regarding the implementation of LNG projects."

        "text": "2.(S/NF) Deputy Secretary Kimmitt and PUS Ricketts agreed that U.S.-UK economic and political-military cooperation in Iraq has been excellent and that more needs to be done to better utilize the large amounts of un-spent financial resources in Iraq. Kimmitt explained that finding sufficient resources was not the problem, rather, Iraq needed to more effectively use the money. Building up Iraq's institutional capacity in order to properly spend funds is key to success. Kimmitt discussed the importance of quickly setting up the one-year review conference for rejuvenating the Iraqi economy. Ricketts pledged the UK would cooperate closely with the U.S. in preparing the conference, and suggested Brussels as a location that was central to most of the major players involved, which could also tap into EU budget coffers. Ricketts agreed to talk to Sweden's Carl Bildt, who had proposed Stockholm, about the possibility of hosting the event in Brussels if Stockholm did not work. Kimmitt noted that economic recovery will be an important issue during U.S. Congressional hearings with Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus and agreed with Ricketts that it is important for the international community to build Iraqi capacity to \"get things done on their own.\" Ricketts promised the UK embassy in Washington would follow up on next steps for the conference.\n3.(S/NF) The Paris Afghanistan conference in June should be sufficiently high-profile to attract Afghanistan President Karzai, in order, among other goals, to have him brief on Afghanistan's progress under the Compact, Secretary Kimmitt told PUS Ricketts. Ricketts said either SIPDIS Foreign Secretary Miliband or Minister Lord Mark Malloch-Brown would attend for the UK. Ricketts expressed concern that Afghanistan's political and security climate had become a more pressing issue than Iraq, and that the UK was worried about: their own military's growing role there, counter-narcotics issues, the need to increase Afghanistan's institutional capacities, and whether Karzai would win the 2009 elections. Ricketts complained that large amounts of money had been disbursed, but not used well, while additional money had been pledged by international donors, but not yet disbursed. Kimmitt stressed the need for effective development assistance.\n4.(S/NF) Ricketts described Prime Minister Brown's deep interest in stabilizing Afghanistan and using all possible multilateral tools - IMF, World Bank, NATO - to coordinate and step up their efforts. Brown is particularly interested in whether money is being effectively spent, and the need to tie assistance to reforms. Ricketts said the newly named envoy for Afghanistan Kai Eide, was a good pick, but not as effective as Paddy Ashdown would have been.\n5.(S/NF) Secretary Kimmitt noted Italy's hesitation to list Bank Melli and asked if it was a signal by Italy regarding overall Iran sanctions policy or represented LONDON 00000781 002 OF 002 Italian commercial interests with Melli. Ricketts confirmed that Italy was holding things up in the EU process, and suspected Italy was influenced by long-term commercial ties with Iran, and the desire to maintain relationships for future use. Ricketts said the UK is working to persuade Italy that Melli is a problem, and that FS Miliband was currently approaching Italy at the GAERC. Ricketts predicted the issue would not be resolved at the GAERC March 10-11, but sent to the EU Council later in the week where PM Brown would address it on the margins with his colleagues before sending it back to the GAERC to resolve. Ricketts promised to keep the U.S. Embassy briefed on the results. Kimmitt noted U.S. desires for a stronger UN Security Resolution than what ended up as UNSCR 1803. Ricketts agreed and said the UK was frustrated with the EU, and stressed the need to resolve the Melli issue clearly in the EU and have them sanctioned before the Iranian elections.\n6.(S/NF) Shifting to the UK domestic front, Kimmitt suggested that the UK change its laws to allow the use of confidential information in its sanctions process. SIPDIS Ricketts said HM Treasury is looking to allow sensitive information to be used in court, and thanked Kimmitt for raising it with HMT.\n7.(S/NF) Secretary Kimmitt and PUS Ricketts agreed on the need to distinguish between sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and state owned enterprises (SOEs) when discussing the issue in public and deciding on government approaches in dealing with each group. Kimmitt explained that in over fifty years of existence, there is no evidence of SWF investment for political reasons. He explained that SWF's own governments need to be more active in addressing concerns about SWF's activities when talking to the press, so that publics do not mistrust their motives. Ricketts said SWFs had been functioning well in London for years, but the UK recently felt the purchase by a Chinese State-owned enterprise of mining company Rio Tinto was done solely as a deliberate and calculated political maneuver. Ricketts also noted that if Gazprom were to show up in London and start purchasing assets it would set off alarm bells, but that on the whole, the UK preferred to let the markets set the tone, rather than government. Ricketts said the UK financial sector was worried when governments talk of regulating SWFs, but were themselves concerned about the role of SOEs.\n8.(U) Participants: UK: Peter Ricketts, Permanent Under Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth Office; Natalie Gowers, SIPDIS U.S. Desk Officer, Foreign and Commonwealth Office; Robert Kimmitt, Deputy Secretary, Treasury, Ambassador Robert Tuttle, Eric Meyer, Director, Europe and Eurasia, Treasury, Rob Saliterman, Spokesman, International Affairs, Treasury, Mark Johnson, Notetaker."

        "text": "Archives|Mirror, Mirror, Who Is the Unfairest?\nMirror, Mirror, Who Is the Unfairest?\nROOTING out conflicts of interest on Wall Street has become a full-time job for securities regulators in recent years. Thankfully, some long-needed changes have been made to research and sales practices at brokerage firms, banks and mutual fund companies.\nBut one conflict lives brazenly on, safe from even the most assiduous reform efforts. That enduring unfairness is related to, of all things, the fairness opinion.\nFairness opinions are produced by Wall Street banks and are intended to assure the directors of companies involved in a merger, acquisition or other deal that its terms are fair to shareholders.\nBut the opinions can be problematic. That's because the bank affirming the fairness of the transaction is often the same one that proposed the deal -- and that stands to reap millions in fees if it goes through. When J.P. Morgan Chase paid $58 billion to acquire Bank One last July, the fairness opinion was supplied by -- who else? -- J.P. Morgan Chase.\nHowever laughable they may be, fairness opinions continue to be used to justify transactions and to provide legal cover for directors fearful of being sued if a deal goes bad.\nAt least some regulators are beginning to awaken to the conflicts that fairness opinions pose. The NASD has asked its members and the public for comments on the practices surrounding the opinions and may propose new rules related to their use.\nIn Massachusetts, William F. Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth, is investigating the fairness opinions supplied by Goldman Sachs and UBS, the two investment banks advising Gillette, which is the subject of a $57 billion offer from Procter & Gamble. Merrill Lynch provided the fairness opinion to Procter.\nMr. Galvin said he had subpoenaed documents relating to these fairness opinions out of concern that the deal might not be, well, fair to Gillette shareholders. \"For us here in Massachusetts, this is a very big deal because many of the shareholders are residents,\" he said. \"The fairness of the valuation is at issue. In the proxy statement, Goldman was credited with bringing the deal together. When one of the fairness opinion providers brought the deal together, how objective could their opinion be?\"\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. UBS's spokesman said, \"We are confident in the advisory services provided to our client.\"\nAs a part of his investigation, Mr. Galvin asked Rajesh K. Aggarwal, a professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in corporate governance and executive pay, to analyze the fairness opinions.\nProfessor Aggarwal wrote in his study that the opinions were reasonable and valid but that there were \"substantial discrepancies\" between the public and private statements the companies have made estimating the merger's value.\nFor example, the companies' public projections on the revenue and cost \"synergies\" they expected to achieve as a result of the merger were about $14 billion to $16 billion. But internal company documents, Professor Aggarwal said, put the estimates at $22.1 billion to $28.1 billion.\nIn addition, he said, there seemed to be errors in the way the merger's value synergies were calculated -- mistakes that underestimate the value of the deal. He concluded that by underestimating the value of the synergies, the deal would be more beneficial to Procter & Gamble shareholders than to Gillette's owners.\nEric Kraus, a Gillette spokesman, said the company had no comment on Professor Aggarwal's analysis. \"Virtually no financial expert thinks the deal is anything but excellent for Gillette shareholders,\" Mr. Kraus said, adding that Gillette was cooperating with Mr. Galvin's inquiry.\nProcter & Gamble said it believed that the opinion provided by Merrill Lynch was fair.\nShareholders of both companies will have the last word. They are scheduled to vote on the merger in June.\nSpeaking generally, Professor Aggarwal said: \"There's a sense that whatever the two parties agree to must be fair. But management has no interest whatsoever in having independent third parties looking at the details of any transactions, and boards historically weren't going to question the judgment of management. So the issue here is the one party that doesn't participate in the negotiations -- the shareholders.\"\nBut shining the spotlight on fairness opinions, as Mr. Galvin has done, is indeed a public service.\nAnd surely, in a time when corporate directors are being held increasingly accountable for their actions, they ought to be concerned about the conflicts that make many fairness opinions so dubious.\n\"I think we're going to see more boards hiring independent parties to evaluate transactions, to evaluate the performance of management and to evaluate compensation contracts,\" Professor Aggarwal said. \"I think that if one of the high-profile deals that are in process now were to blow up because it looked like the board didn't do enough investigation on behalf of shareholders, you would absolutely see a lot more use of third parties to make sure the deal is good for shareholders.\"\nWhen it comes to hiring firms that can conduct truly independent reviews of deals, directors have had few choices.\nBut a new firm, set up by two experienced Wall Street bankers, hopes to change that.\nThe firm, Pirie, Goldsmith & Associates of New York, offers independent fairness opinions on mergers and acquisitions, as well as on asset sales, executive compensation and other issues, said Robert S. Pirie, a former partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and, from 1987 to 1992, the chairman of Rothschild Inc., an investment firm. \"To be able to look the lawyers in the eye and say,'We hired someone who had nothing to do with the deal, who looked at it and said in their opinion it's fair,' if I were a director I'd be very happy to have that,\" Mr. Pirie said.\nGerald Goldsmith, a former top executive at Rothschild, is the firm's other founder; its advisory board members are Paul W. MacAvoy, professor of economics at Yale, and Peter Scanlon, former chairman of Coopers & Lybrand.\nWhile the established Wall Street firms may snicker at the creation of such a firm, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, applauded the idea of an organization devoted to the issuance of unbiased fairness opinions. \"If there was ever going to be a market for this kind of thing it will be now,\" he said. \"It strikes me that it would be very valuable. A lot of mergers are promoted for the benefit of those involved.\"\nAnd all too often, shareholders are the last on that list."

I struggled a little bit, but it wasn't just because of the timeout he took.\"\nDjokovic broke Murray twice to win four games in a row, then the Scot won a marathon game to hold for 2-4 and regained the momentum.\nOverall Murray kept Djokovic off-balance with his variety of pace and direction and thwarted his attempts to come to the net with precise passing.\nMurray's day included two second-serve aces, including one 76 mile per hour ace that flummoxed Djokovic.\n\"The majority of players now play so well from the baseline and both sides, that if you can use some slice and drop shots, some high balls and stuff, it just takes them out of their comfort zone,\" Murray said.\n\"It's my way of dictating how the match is getting played. A lot of people might not necessarily think my game looks the most aggressive or offensive, but very few times will I not have the points played how I like them to be played.\"\nMurray said he also believed he had benefitted from his improved fitness. He has an apartment in the area and did pre-season fitness training here.\n\"I think mentally it makes a difference,\" he said.\n\"Even if you're struggling, you know your opponent is going to be feeling the same. Whereas before, sometimes you could get tired and look over at the other side and the opponent seems fine.\n\"A match like today - it was hot out there. A few long rallies and I would be a little bit out of breath. I could look down the court and see him struggling, as well.\"\nMurray, the first British finalist here for 25 years, took victory when Djokovic went long with a lame volley after an hour and 42 minutes on court.\nThe 21-year-old Scotsman, who had raced through the first set with two breaks taking him to 4-0 lead, has now won three Masters titles. He was the champion in Cincinnati and Madrid in 2008.\n\"I think any time you win a tournament, obviously it gives you confidence,\" said Murray, who had also reached the final of the Masters event at Indian Wells in March.\n\"The Masters Series have always been, after the Slams, tough tournaments to win.\""

        "text": "Florida State treated Division I-AA underdog Western Carolina with compassion Saturday night, sticking to a bare-bones game plan that netted a 50-10 homecoming victory.\nA festive crowd of 52,778 watched on a cool, clear night. They let go with one of their largest cheers before the game when former FSU player Burt Reynolds presented FSU trainer Don Fauls with a new Ford station wagon.\nFauls, with FSU for 28 years, is retiring.\nSo mismatched were the teams that FSU probably could have scored as many points as it wanted. The easy victory was so expected that it did little to enchance FSU's season. It did, however, keep the Seminoles in line for a bowl invitation, probably the Gator Bowl.\nTommy Gay, past president of the Gator Bowl selection committee, watched the Seminoles (8-2) on Saturday and was all but ready to give them his vote.\n\"We think they are our No. 1 choice,\" he said. \"Of course, that could change, but FSU would be a very attractive team for us.\"\nThe Gator Bowl, to be played on Dec. 30 and nationally televised by ABC, is advertising a $900,000 payoff for each team.\nThat much money is a big consideration for FSU. It needs a big payday to help wipe out a projected deficit of $1.5 million. And the proximity of the Gator Bowl, played in Jacksonville, would allow FSU to travel cheaply to the game and thus bring home more money.\nThe Seminoles' opponent would come from a list that includes the third- place finisher in the Big Ten, either Ohio State or Michigan, along with Air Force and Oklahoma State.\nBowl invitations will be extended Saturday.\nFSU, favored by some five touchdowns over Western Carolina, was superior in every category. The Catamounts had a scrappy quarterback in Kenny Edwards, but he couldn't carry the load. Edwards, constantly chased, completed nine of 24 passes for 87 yards.\n\"I'd like to have a game like this every week,\" FSU Coach Bobby Bowden said. \"It was tough to get ready, but I am just glad I was coaching our team and not on the other side coaching against us. We were playing against a team that we were much bigger and stronger than. We just ran it in the middle all night.\"\nFSU was led by tailbacks Tony Smith (13 carries, 114 yards) and Keith Ross (15-103), who scored two touchdowns. Quarterback Chip Ferguson completed seven of 18 passes for 182 yards and a touchdown. Hassan Jones caught four passes for 103 yards and a touchdown.\nThe Seminoles were merciful in that they, for the most part, chose simple, time-consuming plays.\nWestern Carolina (3-6-1) offered few challenges.\nThe Seminoles scored on their first possession when Derek Schmidt kicked a 36-yard field goal. They built a 19-0 halftime lead and coasted from there.\nFor FSU, the game was little more than a necessary chore before turning full attention to a Nov. 30 date with the University of Florida in Gainesville.\nThe Seminoles made sure they revealed no secrets Saturday. After sticking with inside running plays in the first half, Bowden substituted freely in the second half. The result was an uninspiring, sometimes ragged game.\nHomecoming games are supposed to feature lopsided victories by the home team, though, and FSU assured itself of success when it scheduled the Catamounts. Usually, Western Carolina is at least competitive on its own level, but this year it has struggled against even Division I-AA teams.\n\"It has been a tough year, and tonight sort of culminated everything for us,\" Western Carolina Coach Bob Waters said. \"Florida State is a tremendous football team, and I said before the game that they might be the best we've ever played. Now I'm sure they're the best we've played.\""

        "text": "Dan Porter, the former CEO of OMGPOP, now general manager of Zynga New York, apologized to his colleagues on Friday for saying that the company copied ideas for games.\nThe company posted his email to the Zynga blog.\n\"Zynga is often accused of copying games, which is mostly true,\" Porter reportedly said in a panel discussion at a startup's offices in New York Wednesday night, according to Quartz.\nWhat I said was that everyone in the games business copies games. That is the nature of the business and has been well before Zynga was ever in business. My point was that obsessing over the copying of games is really not that interesting and misses the main point.\n.... I should know better. Lesson learned. Sometimes it is truly better to say nothing at all.\nWhile the copying of ideas from games is controversial in the industry, U.S. law is very clear on this point: There is no copyright protection for games as games. Only visual or written elements of a game, like the game board or instructions, can be copyrighted.\nZynga and Electronic Arts recently agreed to drop a lawsuit over claims that The Ville copied elements of EA's Sims franchise.\nPorter did make an interesting point, which is that Zynga's skills as a company are around growing and adapting games over time to keep them fresh for users.\nThis is not the first time Porter's gotten in hot water over remarks he's made at an event.\nNot that these incidents appear to have hurt Porter.\nIn a recent consolidation of remote offices, Porter emerged as the top Zynga executive on the East Coast, absorbing employees from a second New York studio as well as some from closed studios in Baltimore and Boston.\nAnd though a drop in paying customers for Draw Something—the hit mobile drawing game which prompted Zynga to buy OMGPOP—has hurt Zynga's financials, the company recently celebrated Draw Something's one-year anniversary by announcing it had seen more than 100 million downloads.\nDraw Something remains an important franchise for Zynga, which has increasingly emphasized its mobile titles as traffic to its social games on Facebook has dropped."

The wildfires have cut Canada's vast oil sands output in half.\nThe wildfire scorching through Canada's oil sands region in northeast Alberta since last Sunday night had been expected to double in size on Sunday, threatening the neighboring province of Saskatchewan.\nBut with the fire moving into its second week, light rains and cooler temperatures helped hold it back, giving officials hope that they could soon begin assessing the damage to Fort McMurray, close to where the fire started.\n\"As more and more fire has burned out around the city and the fuel around the city starts to disappear.... we are starting to move into that second phase of securing the site and assessing the site,\" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told the same media briefing.\nOfficials said it was too early to put a time line on getting people back into the town safely.\nThe broader wildfire, moving southeast through wooded areas away from the town, would still take a long time to \"clean up,\" Morrison cautioned. Officials previously warned that the fire could burn for months.\nAlberta's government estimated on Sunday that the fire had consumed 395,000 acres. That was less than a previous estimate, but authorities warned the fire would likely grow overnight.\nFort McMurray is the center of Canada's oil sands region. About half of the crude output from the sands, or 1 million barrels per day, has been taken offline, according to a Reuters estimate.\nOil prices jumped almost 2 percent in trading early on Monday, as Canada's fire contributed to tightening supply.\nThe inferno looks set to become the costliest natural disaster in Canada's history. One analyst estimated insurance losses could exceed C$9bn.\nOfficials said on Sunday the fire had done minor damage at CNOOC unit Nexen's Long Lake facility, in the site's yard. It was the first reported damage to an energy industry asset since the fire began.\nMorrison said air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers had kept the blaze from reaching a Suncor Energy facility, which Suncor identified as its base oil sands mining site north of Fort McMurray, and a Syncrude facility.\nSuncor said on Sunday it would allow employees to return to work as soon as it was safe to do so. \"We are hopeful that this will be soon,\" the company said in a statement, adding it planned to use temporary camps for employees and was arranging for workers to commute from Calgary and Edmonton."

They both recovered.\nThree months later, Rowley found a wrapped bottle of perfume in a park in the town of Amesbury and gave it to Sturgess, who became seriously ill after spraying it on herself. The bottle was found to be filled with Novichok.\nRowley had also been exposed. Sturgess died in hospital several days later and Rowley recovered after spending 10 days in a coma. He still has serious health problems from the exposure.\nIn September, British authorities said they had enough evidence to charge two Russians -- known by presumed aliases Aleksandr Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov -- with various crimes including conspiracy to commit murder.\nScotland Yard accused them of being Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers sent to Britain to assassinate Sergei Skripal.\nRussia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the incident. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview that the two suspects were civilians who went to England as tourists. The two men said in an interview with Russian broadcaster RT they went to Britain to see the Salisbury Cathedral and famous nearby monument Stonehenge, which they said they didn't visit because of bad weather.\n\"I liked the ambassador, but I thought some of what he said trying to justify Russia not being responsible was ridiculous,\" said Rowley. \"The ambassador kept saying the substance definitely wasn’t the Novichok [the Russians] had made because if it was it would have killed everyone.\""

Husky Energy has said between 200,000 and 250,000 liters of crude oil and other material leaked into the river on Thursday from its pipeline.\nThe water supply for communities in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan is threatened by an oil spill that dumped an estimated 66,000 gallons of heavy oil, along with natural gas used to dilute it, into a major river.\nThe pipeline that broke is owned by Husky Energy Inc. The site of last Thursday's leak is within 1,000 feet of the North Saskatchewan River.\nThe central Saskatchewan town of North Battleford, which gets its water from the river, shut off its river intake last week and switched to groundwater, according to Reuters.\nBy far the largest community affected so far is the city of Prince Albert, which has a population of about 35,000 people. On Monday, officials there announced they had shut down the city's water treatment plant after the oil slick arrived in town. The CBC reports the city has enough water stored to last 48 hours, and officials are urging residents to limit water use to stretch that until the end of the week, which will buy time to get a backup system running.\nManagers for the province's public works department are working to lay an 18-mile temporary water pipeline to supply the city with water from another source, the South Saskatchewan River.\nThe Globe and Mail reports authorities say they have recovered 40 percent of the spilled liquid so far.\n\"In a telephone conference with reporters, officials from the province of Saskatchewan said they had built five booms to contain the spill and were working with Husky and the federal government on a cleanup plan.\n\"Husky said the cleanup at the site of the leak had been completed, although neither it nor the province gave a time line for resolving the issue entirely.\n\"The company also said three birds had been'impacted' by the spill and that one died.\"\nDespite the severity of the spill, and its widespread effects on people living downstream, the premier of Saskatchewan defended pipelines as the safest way to move oil over land, reported The Canadian Press wire service.\nPremier Brad Wall told the wire service, \"The facts remain that if we're not moving by a pipeline, it's going to move.... (by rail). We know that rail is actually more susceptible to spills and spills are often more intense.\"\nThe neighboring province of Alberta is considering pipeline options to bring crude oil from its tar sands to ocean ports, after a cross-border proposal that would have run through the U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico was shut down by the U.S. government."

Unterberg Towbin analyst James McIlree said last month. \"This is the type of environment the big players wait for to make acquisitions, when a stock tumbles and much of the risk has been taken out of the shares.\"\nMcIlree has a buy recommendation and a $32 price target on Force Protection's stock. His firm has investment banking ties to the company.\nLooking ahead, McIlree calls MRAP II \"the next battlefield\" for Force Protection. Given its strong performance and production record so far, he feels that Force Protection should enjoy a definite edge in that fight.\nMeanwhile, Force Protection has been loudly reminding the military of its strengths. This summer, the company launched an advertising campaign targeting the likes of Defense News and Military Times that touts \"the unmatched battlefield performance\" of its popular MRAP vehicles.\n\"Our business is the protection of our troops facing deadly explosive threats on a daily basis,\" stated Force Protection Vice President Michael Aldrich. \"We feel it is important for them to know that there is a proven solution that is being manufactured and delivered as quickly as possible to support them in their critical mission.\"\nForce Protection has been making those claims for some time, even as rivals like Navistar have managed to land huge contracts and meet tough production deadlines to boot.\nGoing forward, two newcomers -- Oshkosh and Ceradyne -- hope to snag a piece of the action as well. Their new vehicle, known as the Bull, can withstand hits from powerful \"explosively formed penetrators\" and is therefore considered an early favorite for MRAP II awards. Still, the companies are realistic about their odds.\n\"While Oshkosh is optimistic about its chances to play a larger role in MRAP II.... it believes that competitors currently building MRAP I vehicles may have an advantage,\" Robert W. Baird analyst Robert McCarthy wrote this month. Still, \"management appears confident it has learned from its MRAP I experiences and that its proposal for MRAP II will be considerably stronger.\"\nMcCarthy has an outperform rating and a $75 price target on Oshkosh's stock, which rose 3.5% to $56.55 on Tuesday. His firm has investment banking ties to the company.\nCeradyne, which tapped Oshkosh as its partner earlier this year, clearly expects the Bull to burst onto the MRAP scene. The company -- already the top supplier of body armor for U.S. soldiers in Iraq -- stands to pick up some new followers if that happens.\n\"Vehicle armor represents a large new potential market,\" Morgan Joseph analyst Michael French stressed when initiating coverage of Ceradyne last month. French, whose firm seeks to do business with the companies it covers, has a hold recommendation on Ceradyne now -- but he indicates that could change.\n\"If.... the company is successful in its vehicle armor initiatives -- and that becomes evident this fall -- we would become more aggressive on the shares,\" he wrote."

Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said Wednesday that Colombia could grow 5% this year.\nStrong growth in consumer demand, as well as solid figures in manufacturing and retail sales, is behind the improved economic outlook. In the first half of the year, retail sales rose 9.8% from a year earlier, while industrial output climbed 5.8%.\nColombia’s faster economic growth this year, after climbing a tepid 0.8% in 2009, hasn’t created inflationary pressures yet. The consumer price index decreased 0.04% in July as food prices dropped 0.5% from July 2009. Food prices account for 28% of the CPI."

        "text": "Variable costing affects the reported value of inventories.\nA manufacturer has two general ways to account for fixed manufacturing costs: variable costing and absorption costing. Under variable costing, you do not include fixed manufacturing costs in your calculation of the cost of each item you produce. Under absorption costing, you allocate a portion of those fixed costs to each item. Variable costing has distinct advantages for internal planning and assessment, but you can't use it for your external financial reporting.\nVariable costing clearly separates the costs that rise in tandem with production from those that remain constant. Absorption costing, on the other hand, blurs the lines. Say your company manufactures a certain product. Producing one unit requires $5 worth of raw materials, $2 in direct labor and $1 in variable manufacturing costs, such as electricity to run the machinery. Meanwhile, you have $10,000 per quarter in fixed manufacturing costs -- such things as rent or property taxes on your production facility, equipment depreciation and salaries of supervisors. Assume you produce 5,000 units in a quarter. Under variable costing, each unit produced has a reported cost of $8 (that is, $5 plus $2 plus $1). The $10,000 in fixed costs, meanwhile, is treated as a separate quarterly expense. Under absorption costing, each unit has a reported cost of $10 -- $8, plus $2 worth of the fixed cost ($10,000 / 5,000 units = $2 per unit). If you bump production up to 8,000 units, your per-unit cost remains $8 under variable costing, but falls to $9.25 under absorption costing. The consistency offered by variable costing simplifies production budgeting. This can especially benefit a small manufacturer that can't support a separate budgeting department.\nVariable costing provides a more accurate picture of your cash flow, which is critical for small manufacturers operating with tighter margins. In the previous example, imagine you manufactured 5,000 items but sold only 4,000, at $20 apiece. Under variable costing, your revenue is $80,000, the expense you report for the cost of the goods you sold is $32,000 (4,000 x $8), and you have a $10,000 expense for fixed overhead. So your manufacturing profit is $38,000, and your balance sheet shows inventory worth $8,000 (1,000 x $8). But under absorption costing, your revenue is $80,000, your cost of goods sold is $40,000 (4,000 x $10), and you have no separate expense for fixed overhead. Your manufacturing profit is $40,000, with $10,000 (1,000 x $10) on the balance sheet as inventory. An extra $2,000 has been \"parked\" on your balance sheet rather than reported as an expense, even though you've already paid that money.\nFinancial statements prepared under variable costing provide all the data needed for break-even analysis, a key tool in determining how much your company must sell at a certain price before it shows a manufacturing profit. The basic formula is: F/(P-V)=BE, where F is the fixed costs, P is the price, V is the variable costs, and BE is the necessary sales to break even. Using the data from the example, with fixed costs of $10,000 per quarter, a $20 selling price and variable costs of $8, you get: $10,000 / ($20 - $8) = 834 units per quarter (rounded up). Because absorption-costing financial statements lump variable and fixed costs together, they can't be used for break-even analysis.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, require that you use absorption costing in financial statements prepared for outside observers, such as a potential investor in your business or a bank you approach for a loan. The GAAP standard-setters believe that absorption costing better upholds the matching principle, which requires that expenses be reported in the same period as the revenue generated by those expenses. Since fixed manufacturing costs contribute revenue only when manufactured goods are actually sold for revenue, the thinking goes, they shouldn't be expensed until then. GAAP only applies to external statements, though. You can use variable costing on internal documents. Maintaining two sets of records may add to your accounting costs, if your business doesn't handle accounting in-house, but it's not as difficult as trying to derive absorption-costing statements from those based on variable costing, or vice versa. The extra cost, if any, may be well worth the benefits to a smaller manufacturer.\nMerritt, Cam. \"The Pros & Cons of Variable Costing Accounting.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-variable-costing-accounting-43136.html.

        "text": "AMES, Iowa - Violent crime rates are taking a nosedive across the nation, according to a data from the FBI, and Ames is one city topping the list.\nData from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report analyzed by 24/7 Wall St. shows violent crime fell to 355.5 incidents per 100,000 residents - the lowest it's been in decades. Violent crime peaked in the 1990s, but has steadily declined over the past 20 years. The data analyzed looks at a five-year span, from 2010 to 2014, and ranks Dubuque and Ames as the #1 and #2 cities in the U.S. where crime has plummeted the most.\nIn Dubuque, the five-year decrease in violent crime is 58 percent; Ames boasts a 56 percent drop in violent crime over that same five-year period. Officials with the Ames Police Department say having a low violent crime rate has helped officers focus energy on proactive measures to keep it that way.\n\"One of the tenants we have here at the police department is problem solving and relationship building,\" said Commander Jason Tuttle with Ames PD. \"And so, when we can do that, and we have the time to do that, we can get into the neighborhoods, work with some of the community leaders, work with some of the neighborhood association leaders on trying to solve specific problems in our neighborhoods. And when we do that, we're working side by side with them to work through those issues, rather than policing over them and having more of a confrontational relationship with those citizens.\"\nThere was only one homicide reported in Ames in the five-year span of the study, with zero homicides from 2012-2014. Police say the study doesn't include 2015 data, where the city had just one homicide - classified as \"justifiable\" due to self-defense.\n\"I've lived here for 30 years in the same neighborhood, and generally I would say I've never had the perception that violent crime was ever a problem,\" said Debbie Lee, leader of the Oak to Riverside Neighborhood Association in Ames.\nLee credits the police department for being proactive, by forming close relationships with the city's neighborhood associations.\n\"Progress doesn't happen in a vacuum, and I would really credit - Ames has been fortunate to have an exceptional police chief who has been willing to be creative and try different approaches,\" Lee said.\nThose different approaches include training landlords to keep crime out of their apartments, meeting with students every fall at Iowa State University, and providing resource officers to neighborhoods.\n\"I credit this very much to the leadership in the police department, that has - on the area of violent crime, on the area of mental health, on the area of alcohol abuse, on the areas of racial relations - been working very hard on being a proactive rather than a reactive situation,\" said Ames Mayor Ann Campbell.\nComm. Tuttle says it's a cycle: if you have a low violent crime rate, you can focus your energy on preventative measures to keep it that way.\n\"We don't pay a great amount of attention to these reports because we're working daily to build those relationships, and educate people in our community on how to have those safe neighborhoods,\" he said.\nWhile violent crime is down in Ames - and especially in the category of homicides - it should be noted Ames' sexual assault rate was higher in the study's span than the national average. Ames officials note, however, the rate over the five-year span of the study is lower than it was for the city in the late 2000s."

Remote Performance Management Solutions play a central role in successful network assessment.\nThe cloud is growing and as a result businesses are becoming increasingly dependent on cloud-based technologies to run their businesses. One example revolves around VoIP technology. Many business owners are attracted to VoIP because of its cost savings and applications that drive employee productivity; however some business owners hesitate because they are concerned about sacrificing call quality. This often occurs when companies conduct business with a technology provider that does not have the proper technical expertise or the tools to successfully deploy IP based solutions. Advanced Remote Performance Management Software pinpoints network drains, all the way down to the appliance. The tool provides valuable insight that can determine which appliance, such as a PC, within an organization is hoarding bandwidth causing poor voice or video quality.\nIn order to keep up with the rapid pace of technology, data networks will need to become much stronger, faster, flexible and transparent. The success of a business's operations will be strongly correlated to network performance and Remote Performance Management Solutions allow businesses to diagnose network issues and resolve problems immediately.

        "text": "A month on from Tripoli’s fall to rebel forces, the leaders of France and Britain are traveling to the city in a show of support for the regime their warplanes helped put in power, while those who backed Colonel Gaddafi remain defiant but fearful.\n­On the eve of the visit of French President Nicholas Sarkozy and British PM David Cameron, the head of the National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, has asked for more weapons to fight pockets of Colonel Gaddafi's loyalists and remove them from their remaining strongholds.\nThe rebel government thinks the ousted dictator is hiding in southern Libya and planning a fight-back.\nHowever, the new authority is asserting an increasing level of control over the country.\nFor some, that is cause for celebration – but many others are reserved in their optimism.\nIn parts of Tripoli it feels as if the rebels’ triumphant campaign never happened, or did so elsewhere, in some parallel version of the Libyan capital.\n“We will do anything for Muammar, only Muammar! Even if we give our life for that!” claims one street vendor, while hiding her face from RT’s camera.\nAnd it was the same story with others who fervently support the ousted Libyan leader.\nThose calling themselves rebels are once again celebrating on Martyrs’ Square in downtown Tripoli. This time, they are welcoming Libya’s new government to the capital.\nThe head of the National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, spoke before large crowds, leaving Libyans in no doubt about who is now in charge.\nBut while the NTC leader was giving his speech, most of Tripoli’s population preferred to stay close to their businesses and homes.\nThose who do not support Mustafa Abdul Jalil and could be seen all across the city proudly waving green flags just weeks ago backing Gaddafi, are now reluctant to leave their own backyards.\n“They are afraid because if they go out they will die instantly because there are many people with weapons and guns,” one man, who was afraid to speak on camera, told RT.\nWith Gaddafi effectively gone, the new authorities have settled down here in the capital, Tripoli. People are chanting that Libya is now a new free country. But it seems there is at least one thing that still remains – fear.\nThe 19-year-old says many of his friends have been arrested recently for making statements critical of the new regime. Ironically, we were talking just a kilometer away from one of Gaddafi’s top secret jails for political prisoners known as Abu Sleem.\n“The rebels, they only represent themselves – not the Libyan people. This revolution started with killings to intimidate through fear. Their hands are all covered in blood,” Ahmed said.\nAmnesty International has recently accused both Gaddafi's regime and the one which replaced it of committing war crimes, including killings and torture of soldiers, prisoners and civilians.\nHere in the Libyan capital, there is widespread fear that more is in store."

        "text": "My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development. An increasing body of data suggests this is accomplished by modifying the genome both in the nature of the proteins bound to different sequences and in the spatial organization of those sequences relative to each other. The spatial organization or folding of the genome may be particularly important in complex multicellular organisms, since many of the sequences known to interact based on genetic data are nonetheless substantially separated from each other along the linear genome. By regulating the folding of this linear sequence into a higher order structure, a cell might change which regulatory sequences have access to which genes, and achieve different behavioral states.\nSo far we have little imaging data on how the genome is folded within a cell on the length scale of individual genes, or whether this folding is regulated in any way relevant to the behavior of the cell. Our limited knowledge stems largely from want of a method that has both the resolution and specificity to visualize such genomic substructure. Conventional fluorescent microscopy has developed excellent tools for coloring specific regions of DNA and particular DNA-associated proteins with uniquely colored dyes — but lacks the resolution to turn these colored blurs into structures. Electron-microscopy has substantially greater resolution but lacks compatibility with specific labeling techniques to tell different gene clusters or different protein types apart. Super-resolution imaging approaches promise to address this balance by allowing the use of fluorescent labels while simultaneously resolving structures on the nano-scale. I have been adapting this approach to uncover the nano-scale structure of chromatin and determine to how this structure changes when bound by different types of nuclear proteins. While individual gene clusters appear as quite diverse structures, there appear to be a few general features, for example, linking structure with the epigenetic state.\nOligoSTORM and OligoDNA-PAINT meld the Oligopaint technology for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with, respectively, Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) and DNA-based Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT) to enable in situ single-molecule super-resolution imaging of nucleic acids. Both strategies enable ≤20 nm resolution and are appropriate for imaging nanoscale features of the genomes of a wide range of species, including human, mouse, and fruit fly (Drosophila)."

With the help of Wildlife Aid, three hedgehog hoglets were rescued just 24 hours after their mother had abandoned them.\nObviously a little cold and frightened, the three little creatures were brought back to full health and now appear to be getting used to their new comfy surroundings.\nBeing told apart by dabbing nail polish on their spines, the three then break the cute barrier by sneezing. Not much else to say really, just look at them!\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the world of modern American politics. Republican presidential hopeful Senator Lindsey Graham doesn’t really want you to concern yourself with public policy decisions.\nRather, for some reason, he’d have you more concerned with throwing in a dig at other hopeful and toupéd billionaire Donald Trump all while breaking old mobile phones.\nIt literally offers nothing else, but it’s proving pretty popular online so if you like seeing a middle-aged, powerful white guy getting his teenage angst on, then look no further.\nCouldn’t agree more with the title of this video, frankly. I’m not sure where exactly it is but it’s hard to imagine a more grim-looking backyard pool.\nAs always with fail videos, however, it has the gradual, slow build-up that all people love as he wets his feet (?) prior to his dive attempt and bigging himself up to the guy filming him.\nSo take note kids, an actual diving board is much better to use than a flimsy plastic chair.\nEating a hot dog at a baseball game is as American as you get, that is, unless you aren’t really watching the game are failing at eating said hot dog.\nThis was the case for one kid at a baseball game who was caught on camera failing miserably at eating an adult-sized hot dog.\nEither way, watching a kid fail at eating a hot dog at a baseball game is arguably more entertaining than actually watching a baseball game.\nWatch out for his killer ‘five second rule’ skills.\nYo dawg, we hear you like rescuing drones so we got a drone to rescue your drone so you can have two drones.\nThis meme reference was brought you with the help of Harrisen Howes who as a drone pilot foolishly let one of his drunk friends fly one of his aircraft, who then ended up crashing it on a neighbour’s roof.\nAnd this begins the most dramatic drone rescue of all time (probably) recruiting a bigger DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone to rescue the original Syma X5C, all to the music of soundtrack legend Hans Zimmer.\nFly drone, you’re free now!\nThis week in ‘when animals make weird noises we weren’t expecting’, a deer in Japan surprises American tourists with a weird noise we weren’t expecting.\nIt sort of sounds like a curious fart noise, only for it to be followed up by some satanic scream that probably says something if you played it backwards.\nHonestly, the people’s reactions to the deer is probably the best bit of the video, they really find it hilarious and I don’t blame them.\nSeagulls. No one likes them and anyone who does must have a psychotic streak that enjoys seeing the scourge of skies rule our lives during the summer months.\nWell for one man and golfer, he’s beginning (entirely by accident) a one-man crusade to end their dominance over the world, one golf swing at a time.\nAnd all it took was one really, really bad golf swing off the tee. “Yeah, he killed a bird”, says one man behind the golfer who is truly the most observant type.\nWe don’t know if the bird is actually dead, but we can be rest assured there’s at least five to take its place.\nIn an orchestra, the sousaphone can add much needed oomph to the tinnier sound of the violin, but on its own, it becomes an instrument of hilarity.\nIn this case, a KKK rally in the US was thankfully interrupted by one anti-KKK protestor who brought their sousaphone, giving them some hilarious marching music.\nThe KKK crowd don’t react, thankfully, but are clearly miffed by the send-off. Oh well.\nKudos Elvery Sports, you’ve done good here. In its bid to sell more jerseys it’s done some competition or whatnot, but to promote it it has hired Irish rugby star Simon Zebo to take on the role of John McClane from Die Hard in Try Hard.\nAdding a massive wedge of Irishness, Zebo fights off comedian Patrick McDonnell who plays the Hans Gruber role.\nWell, aside from Patrick actually, it’s mostly filled with some rather entertaining acting from non-actors, which is usually worth a good laugh, and it’s worth giving a watch."

        "text": "Fish oil. Protein shakes. Vitamin D pills. The packages look alike. Does it matter which you buy? It certainly does, according to Labdoor, a four-year-old, South San Francisco-based startup that tests about 50 supplements and energy drinks each month that it buys off retail shelves, then ranks for consumers.\nWhat it finds might intrigue you. Vitamin C degrades in water, for example, so any water-based Vitamin C tablets are basically worthless. More than a quarter of fish oil products are rancid on the shelves, even when their expiration date may be two years out. Many protein powders don’t live up to their claims, either. Some are largely composed of amino acids rather than the 100 percent whey protein isolate advertised on the label. Others contain so much sodium that consumers confuse bloating for muscle mass.\nWhy are these things allowed? FDA loopholes, says Labdoor founder and CEO Neil Thanedar, who says that in the case of protein powders, for example, manufacturers need only test the nitrogen content of their product. And to a nitrogen test, amino acids and why protein isolate look the same.\nThanedar, who studied chemistry and molecular biology at the University of Michigan, seems almost destined to be taking on the $36 billion-dollar-per-year supplements industry. He says his father, Shri, ran testing labs his entire life, and he was intrigued from a young age in the science behind the labs. In fact, though his father had retired by the time Thanedar was graduating from college, he pulled him back into the business. “I decided I wanted to start a lab instead of get a job, so I kind of wrangled him in and we ran it together for three years and now he runs that lab independently” in Michigan, says Thanedar.\nWhile lucrative, Thanedar saw an opportunity to cater to customers and let them know what, exactly, it is that they’re ingesting.\nWhat they see is a big opportunity beyond affiliate marketing, which is how Labdoor has been making money until recently.\nNow, in addition to sending visitors to Amazon to buy that top-rated multivitamin (and sending Amazon a healthy percentage of its revenue), Labdoor has begun experimenting with direct sales, fulfilling orders itself or else sending them directly to the products’ manufacturers, which it aims to do more of.\n“Part of the issue is routine quality control. We want to make sure your fish oil is fresh,” Thanedar says.\nIt also wants to start testing — and directly selling — cosmetics, personal care products like sunscreens, and baby food — “anything that people buy based on brand loyalty versus the actual content of the products,” says Thanedar.\nLike Amazon itself, it wants you to start buying these things on a subscription basis, too.\nThat shouldn’t be as hard as it sounds. The company is already operating out of a 9,000-square-foot warehouse and plans to carve out 2,000 square feet for its tests.\nIt also wants to get to 30 employees, the number of people who Thanedar projects the company will need to begin testing up to 100 different products each month.\nNot last, Labdoor is aiming to bolster its users, including, largely through SEO and by creating more original content. Thanedar says that roughly five million people have visited the site to date to either research a product or buy it directly, producing around $1 million in revenue so far in this year.\nIf he has his way, that number should be increasingly dramatically soon, too."

Students from Shining Mountain, Monarch and the Watershed School marched to the Boulder County Courthouse.\nDozens of students in Boulder-area schools walked out Friday, while most in the state stayed in class or participated in low-key, meaningful activities to mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre.\nInstead of leaving classes during a national protest against gun violence, students at Columbine spent Friday doing community service work. The school has traditionally closed its doors on April 20, the day two students with firearms in 1999 walked inside and killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.\nAbout 500 students and activists rallied Thursday night near Columbine High, calling for tougher laws to end gun violence. The event marked the start of the Vote for Our Lives movement, which is pushing teens and 20-somethings to register and vote for candidates who back stricter gun-control measures.\nAmong those at Thursday night’s rally were students who survived the Feb. 14 massacre that left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That shooting began a national student movement aimed at ending gun violence and tightening restrictions on guns.\nStudents from more than 2,700 schools and institutions across the country left their classes at 10 a.m. in each time zone Friday to remember the Columbine massacre. After walking out of class and observing a 13-second moment of silence for gun-violence victims, students lobbied to register voters and marched to the offices of local legislatures.\nSome Denver Public Schools high schoolers had discussed a walkout and march to the state Capitol to mirror similar protests across the country, but that did not materialize, said district spokesman Will Jones.\nInstead, students at Kunsmiller Creative Arts Academy in Denver took part in a “Peace Walk” in Harvey Park, adjacent to the school, while a variety of on-campus activities were put on at the Denver School of the Arts.\nStudents from four high schools walked out of class in Boulder and marched to the Boulder County Courthouse, where they chanted: “Hey, hey, ho, ho! The NRA has got to go!” Watershed Waldorf School Junior Dani Cooke said the demonstrators were hoping to combat complacency about gun violence.\n“In a place like Boulder, there are a lot of people who don’t recognize oppression or issues of social justice, like gun violence, because they haven’t directly touched our community as much as they have others,” Cooke told the Daily Camera.\nDudley Brown, the president of the Loveland-based National Association for Gun Rights, said the protesting students are seeking to destroy Second Amendment rights to bear arms.\nOrganizers said an estimated 150,000 students protested Friday across the nation, including at least one school in each state, as they sought to sustain a wave of youth activism that had driven a larger round of walkouts March 14. Activists behind the earlier protest estimated it drew nearly 1 million students.\nIn many cities, it was common to see crowds of students clad in orange — the color used by hunters to signal “Don’t shoot” — rallying outside their schools and at public parks.\nThe Boulder Daily Camera and Associated Press contributed to this report."

        "text": "RISK: Taking out a roof warranty is essentially another form of insurance paid for at the time of installation.\nKeeping and maintaining a roof is essential to the structure of any building.\nHaving a roof warranty can help with keeping peace of mind. The Bermuda Sun spoke to Kaissa managing director Charles Dunstan about what a roof warranty entails.\nWhat is a roof warranty?\nAs with certain other elements of construction, a roofing system is deemed of such critical importance to the long-term life cycle of a building that it requires extra assurance of correct construction and installation.\nOrdinarily, this risk is assumed by the building insurer but, more and more, the installer and the roofing system manufacturer are taking on this risk as a sign of their commitment to excellence in the design, manufacture and execution of the roof system installation.\nEssentially, a warranty is another form of insurance, the cost of which is paid for at the time of installation.\nManufacturers pass this risk on to their insurers. For this reason, it is insurance companies that have driven the industry forward in improved specifications and quality control.\nFactory Mutual Insurance is one such leader in property insurance.\nFM’s business approach is centered on the belief that property losses can be prevented or mitigated.\nFM Global engineering personnel regularly visit insured locations to evaluate hazards and recommend improvements to their property or work practices to reduce physical and financial risks if a loss occurs.\nThey have taken the initiative in testing and approval of a wide range of building elements, including in depth testing of roof systems.\nIn North America, their Roofnav system is a recognized source for approved roof system ratings.\nSimilarly, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) issue standards for engineering performance for various building elements, such as roofs.\nThese are published for use by architects and specifiers in design of the appropriate roof for a property development.\nWhat types of roof warranties are available?\nThey can also vary in coverage. Some are simply material warranties, covering only the material to last for its stated life cycle or at least warranty period.\nSome are labour warranties, backing up the installation for a stated period of time, usually no more than five years.\nOr there are full system warranties, which cover both material and installation for a stated period.\nWhat doesn’t a warranty cover?\nIn a material only warranty, the installation labour is excluded. If the roof material fails, the owners recourse is limited to replacement of the cost of material only.\nIn a labour warranty, the material cost may be excluded.\nA full system warranty may have various limits declared within its terms that the consumer should examine and be aware of.\nFor example, each roof project should have performance requirements outlined in the specification documents that are tied to one of the rating systems mentioned above, such as FM or ASCE.\nThere will be certain parameters on the performance of the roof pertaining to wind uplift, vapour permeance and thermal resistance.\nThese performance requirements have to be clearly identified and quantified at the outset in order to qualify for coverage.\nThere are limits on all elements of risk.\nWind uplift coverage will be limited to 120mph of wind speed.\nWarranty coverage will exclude damage from wind blown debris.\nAt one time exclusions often made reference to the general phrase “Acts of God”.\nLately this generality has been replaced by more specific terms and requirements, as the insurers tighten up their risk exposure.\nWhy are roof warranties important?\nFollowing significant storm damages, much investigation and research goes into determining what factors led to the demise of a failed roof system.\nFrom this research, new techniques and standards are created to mitigate the risk of failure in the future.\nOnce a manufacturer knows the risk is mitigated, they can offer the assurance of a warranty to ensure the roof system is designed and installed correctly. The existence and the extent of coverage says to the property developer that the roof system has been designed and installed to a standard that the manufacturer and installer will stand behind.\nWhat are the benefits of having a roof warranty?\nThe roof warranty can also be useful in indicating maintenance cycles.\nIn the case of a Bermuda ‘K’ Roof system (widely known as the SKB system), the topcoat requires reapplication every five years in order to continue protection for the base assembly.\nFor this reason, the warranty carries a duration of five years, and becomes null and void unless this regular maintenance is undertaken.\nThe warranty term builds in budgeting expectations for the property owner for maintenance and replacement of this major building element.\nWhat are some of the issues that can arise with a roof that a warranty will cover?\nThe most vulnerable element of any roof system is the edge termination.\nFM’s Roofnav rating system will specify details on fastening and adhesion for the perimeter termination of all certified roof systems.\nIn the case of a roof failure, the resulting investigation will usually begin at the perimeter.\nUnless it can be proven that the perimeter termination was not installed according to the specification, the failure will be covered by the warranty.\nHow do people go about filing a claim in the event of an issue with their roof?\nInstructions for claims on the warranty will usually be included in the standard terms of the warranty document.\nThe developer should familiarize himself with the document in case he ever needs to activate the terms.\nInitially, this is no different than filing a claim with any insurer. There will be some burden of proof involved with an ensuing investigation, but this will be borne by the warranty provider.\nKaissa Limited is located 117 Front St. They can be contacted on 495-4242."

        "text": "Editor's note: Stephen Lemons is a blogger and columnist with Phoenix New Times in Phoenix, Arizona.\nPhoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Every movement needs heroes. The fight against discrimination in the state of Arizona just got nine.\nSometime before noon Tuesday, nine activists entwined their bodies in a thick steel chain, locking themselves to the doors of the Arizona Capitol in protest against the recently passed Senate Bill 1070, a bill that would open the door to racial profiling in the Grand Canyon state and force all law enforcement officers with \"reasonable suspicion\" to inquire about the immigration status of those they stop.\nIn a statement, the nine activists said they chained themselves to the doors \"because nothing else has worked..... Our purpose is to expose Arizona's apartheid legislation, and to uphold our dignity and human rights.\"\nIf the use of the word apartheid seems extreme to the uninitiated, all I can say is that you have to know this bill, and this state, to understand that it is, unfortunately, all too correct. Brewer should veto this dangerous, abhorrent and costly measure.\nThe new legislation, which was written by state Sen. Russell Pearce, resembles the dictates of an authoritarian government. It would presume all those stopped by police to be immigrants unlawfully present in the United States unless they are carrying one of several forms of federal or state ID. Even citizens could be held if they do not have their papers on them.\nThose here illegally would be turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Aliens here legally, who are not in possession of their registration documents, could be fined $500 and jailed for six months.\nPolice agencies that do not enforce federal immigration law \"to less than the full extent permitted,\" according to the bill, could be sued by any legal Arizona resident and fined anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 a day.\nAlthough the new law would apply to all residents, in determining \"reasonable suspicion\" the legislation allows police to take into consideration any two of the following: race, color or national origin. Considering the state's proximity to Mexico, and the fact that nearly one-third of Arizona's population is Hispanic, mass racial profiling will be the inevitable consequence if the governor fails to veto the measure.\nAs the legislation has inched toward becoming law, the outcry against it has become more and more vocal, drawing both the fringes and concerned citizens into a carnival of the enraged and the desperate. The debate has become polarized, with proponents of the legislation calling opponents \"open borders anarchists,\" and critics referring to the other side's partisans as \"racists\" or \"Nazis.\"\nOn Monday, as the state Senate debated the measure, prayer vigils, hunger strikers and protesters comparing the bill to police state-style roundups competed with Second Amendment enthusiasts toting assault rifles and pistols, all for the attention of the media.\nFor the most part, the pro-firearms people didn't interact with the SB 1070 protesters (gun laws in Arizona allow residents legally to carry their firearms either openly or concealed), but one enraged gun-wearer began shouting, blaming the demonstrators for the death of Rob Krentz, the southern Arizona rancher slain recently, some believe by a drug runner or human smuggler from Mexico.\nThe man was mostly ignored by the anti-SB 1070 crowd. They were intent on a mock funeral of political \"courage,\" complete with coffins, weeping women and a minister with the United Church of Christ, outfitted in a dog collar.\nBut on Tuesday, the chaos was more desperate. Hundreds swarmed the Capitol for a rally urging Brewer to veto the legislation, while the bill's supporters stayed away. Then the nine affixed themselves to the Capitol, which dates back to Arizona's days as a territory.\nThe Capitol Police had to squeeze through the crush of reporters and activists who had crowded near the spectacle, refusing to disperse. The nine, seated, remained quiet. The bolt cutters came out, chains were cut, and the demonstrators were arrested. Later, they were transported to the Fourth Avenue Jail and charged with disorderly conduct.\nBut before they were bused away, something small happened -- not that odd, really, but strangely moving.\nFrom inside a room where they had been sequestered to await their lawyers, the nine activists, all Hispanics and 20-somethings, began singing \"We Shall Overcome,\" the anthem of the civil rights movement.\nAs I listened along with other reporters, bystanders, tourists and groups of schoolchildren there to inspect the Capitol, I felt something like hope tinged with defiance, even as SB 1070 sits poised to rend Arizona's social fabric, bringing forth a new order that is odious -- and un-American.\nNine brave young men and women just stood in the way of that injustice, in an outcry they hope their nation hears.\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Lemons.\nWill others follow Arizona's lead on immigration?"

It's sometimes referred to as \"Abraham Lincoln disease\" because victims tend to be unusually tall and lanky-limbed, but it can have other, potentially deadly symptoms, including defects of the heart valves and aorta. \"She went though many surgeries and spent a lot of time in hospitals,\" says Falco. \"But they didn't really know what to do. They didn't give much hope. We just went through hell.\"\nThose years of hardship as he and his wife of 38 years, Susan, struggled with a special-needs child left a powerful imprint on the TV executive. So, when he signed on as CEO of Univision in 2011 -- after 31 years at NBC, rising to network president in 1993 -- he decided to take a look at how the No. 1 Spanish-language broadcaster in the U.S. handled its philanthropic programs. \"It's so impor­tant for people to know that there are other people who actually care,\" he says. One of the first things he did at his new job was make sure Univision was reaching out as smartly as it possibly could.\nThe company already had numerous philanthropic programs in place, but Falco, 61, found them too scattered to be of maximum benefit, so he decided to give the network a more narrowly defined mission. \"Rather than try to do a hundred different things, I tried to focus on four things that I thought were really important in providing service to the community,\" he says. Those four were education, health care, prosperity (promoting financial literacy) and civic participation, which Falco gathered under an umbrella program called Univision Contigo (or Univision With You).\nSince the new initiative began in 2013, it has launched innovative programs like the Univision Farmacia discount, which has helped 1.9 million participants save an estimated $32 million with prepaid cards that can be used at local pharmacies. It also is teaming with Steve Jobs' widow, Laurene, for an early education program in Silicon Valley and with The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation for an early reading program for underprivileged children called Too Small to Fail.\n\"Kids,\" says Falco, \"are the great common denominator among all cultures. All parents want what is best for their children.\" Jessica, by the way, is now 29 and recently graduated with a degree in speech pathology."

After five-and-a-half months of back-to-backs, TNT Thursday nights and countless hours debating who's better and who's best, it's finally time to let the players and coaches decide a true champion.\nTo be sure, you'll hear no complaints from me about the season that was. The 2014-15 campaign was arguably the most exciting and intriguing one the Association has seen in some time. From the rise of the Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks to the depth of competition out West to the scramble to fill out the Eastern Conference bracket, there was nary a dull moment from start to finish in the league's schedule.\nThat being the case, it might seem like a tall order for the playoffs to live up to the regular season that just transpired. But without a clear-cut favorite to take home the Larry O'Brien Trophy, this postseason is shaping up to be every bit as captivating as the slate that preceded it, if not more so.\nBefore we get wrapped up in all the best-of-seven series to come, let's look back to see how the NBA as a whole finished up by ranking each of the 30 teams based on how they played down the stretch and which players they had available.\nAnother year, another sad slate of basketball for the Minnesota Timberwolves. An incessant spate of injuries—from Kevin Martin's wrist to Kevin Garnett's knee to Shabazz Muhammad's finger to the ankles of Ricky Rubio and Nikola Pekovic and beyond—doomed the Wolves to their 11th straight trip to the lottery from start to finish in 2014-15.\nLaVine might (eventually) be one of those teammates. The UCLA product nearly averaged 19 points, five rebounds and five assists while shooting better than 40 percent from three over his final 18 games (17 starts).\nThe Wolves can look forward to a summer marked by growth from their youngsters, rather than one consumed by the inevitable ouster of an anxious franchise cornerstone. That, in itself, could be enough to ignite a productive offseason in Minnesota, along with whatever the team yields from its latest lottery pick.\nAnd if the Wolves can exterminate their infestation of injury bugs before October, they just might make something meaningful of 2015-16.\nNerlens Noel won't likely wind up as the NBA's Rookie of the Year, but unlike last year's winner (Michael Carter-Williams), the Kentucky product can probably count on a long-term future with the Philadelphia 76ers.\nNoel did plenty to make up for lost time after missing what would have been his maiden campaign in 2013-14 while recovering from a torn ACL. He led all rookies in double-doubles and was the only player in the league to finish in the top 10 in both steals and blocks, all while missing a mere six of his team's 82 games.\nEach game, eight Sixers staffers would track different metrics, including shot contests, hustle plays and how quickly players attacked different areas after an offensive miss and filled sections of the court defending in transition. After the game, the overall team and each player would receive a grade, 1-20, with the latter being the highest.\nBrown said more than 60 percent of the time in games this season, the team finished at a respectable 16. As for Noel, more than 60 percent of the time he was better than 12 in games. But the most significant number is this: When he was an 18 or higher, the Sixers won 15 of the 18 games.\nNoel may not be the star of the future for the Sixers, but if everyone else plays as hard as he does, the team should still be in good shape long-term.\nThe Orlando Magic were never likely to so much as sniff the playoffs this year, even in the weak East. From the get-go, their roster was more smorgasbord of useful pieces than cohesive whole and wasn't likely to move much from the former toward the latter under the uninspired auspices of Jacque Vaughn. The team's decision to can Vaughn during the season confirmed as much.\nWhoever fills Orlando's void on the bench more permanently will be charged with that same daunting but doable task—of molding the likes of Victor Oladipo, Elfrid Payton, Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon and the fruit of the Magic's lottery pick into an honest-to-goodness team.\nJames Borrego, who replaced Vaughn on an interim basis, will get a look at the gig, following a so-so second-half audition.\n\"I absolutely believe that I can do this,\" Borrego told NBA.com's John Denton. \"My confidence is very high, and this position has forced me to get there. Give our players credit and our staff credit because they have helped me get through this.\"\nGranted, Borrego isn't out of the woods just yet. According to the Orlando Sentinel's Brian K. Schmitz, Michael Malone, who was one of the finalists to succeed Stan Van Gundy three years ago, is among those eager to interview for the gig.\nIf there's any consolation for Orlando's post-Dwight Howard doldrums, it's that the team's job opening could be the most desirable one in the NBA this summer.\nIf the Los Angeles Lakers didn't, in fact, hit rock bottom this season, then they're going to need some sturdier digging equipment.\nAfter losing a then-franchise-record 55 games last year, the purple and gold managed to fall even further in 2014-15. They registered their first 60-loss campaign and their lowest single-season winning percentage while logging more games lost to injury than 2013-14's snakebitten bunch.\nSteve Nash was done before the schedule began. Rookie Julius Randle broke his leg in Game 1. Kobe Bryant's shoulder gave way in January. By the time the Lakers made it to the finish line, four more guys (i.e., Nick Young, Ronnie Price, Wayne Ellington and Dwight Buycks) would suffer season-ending injuries.\nLin really wanted this to work, entering this season with one of the most unstable career paths in sports history. And in search of feel-good stories in an unquestionably dry spell for the franchise, the Lakers hoped bringing Lin back to his birthplace would spark the sort of special stuff we all know he's had in the past.\nInstead, Lin was downright disappointing night after night early in the season. He was unnerved by Lakers coach Byron Scott's lack of belief in his game and discouraged by the rising negativity all around him.\nChances are that Lin will find employment elsewhere this summer. In his place, the Lakers will likely turn to rookie Jordan Clarkson, the lone bright spot amid this year's cloudy misery, or a high-priced free agent of some sort to run point.\nAnd, with any better luck, the Lakers will have the pieces in place to restore some of their signature shine next season.\nLike the Lakers, the New York Knicks came into the 2014-15 season intending to win, even though the circumstances were ripe for failure.\nInjuries and roster turnover all but assured the Knicks of a return trip to the lottery, as did the 5-36 start that the instability precipitated. Carmelo Anthony's decision to undergo knee surgery after the All-Star Game was merely another nail in New York's orange-and-blue coffin.\nAs miffed as many folks in the Big Apple may be with the job Phil Jackson and Derek Fisher have done in leading the Knicks so far, not everyone in town is so down on the team's prospects.\nNobody expected the season to be like this. We all expected at least to somewhat compete in the Eastern Conference. At the end of the day we wanted to make a playoff push, but that's not how the season played out.\nThis next season for me and for the organization and for Phil this is where we earn our money. This is where it starts. We got to put our money where our mouths (are) at. We've been put in a situation where the pieces are broken and a lot of things have been changed around here. Now we got a clean plate. We got a chance to get a top draft pick. We got a lot of money in the cap. So we got to put that to work. We got to put something together.\nThe Charlotte Hornets could have easily blamed their 5-16 finish to the 2014-15 season—and the playoff shortfall it sealed—on the incessant spate of injuries, but they didn't.\n\"This is a disappointing year. We took a step back,\" head coach Steve Clifford admitted, per The Charlotte Observer's Rick Bonnell. \"We weren't as disciplined, we made too many mistakes, more nights when we weren't ready to play. We're not a 33-win team. And I'm primarily responsible for that.\"\nThe players, to their credit, aren't running from their failures. Lance Stephenson, for one, doesn't intend to shoot 17 percent from three forever.\n\"My three-point percentage was the lowest ever in history. That's terrible,\" Stephenson said, per The Charlotte Observer. \"I have to come in and figure out how to be a better shooter. Being a good shooter will help my overall game. When people sag off of me (playing him to drive), it's harder for me to be successful.\n\"It's confidence—just wanting the shot to go in so bad and then you lose your confidence. That plays a major part when you don't have confidence in your shot. This summer I'm going to find my confidence.\"\nWhile Stephenson spends his offseason trying to gain confidence, Al Jefferson will be doing his darndest to lose weight—before and after he officially opts into the final year of his contract.\n\"I've got unfinished business here. That's not even an option for me,\" Jefferson said, per The Observer. \"Unless something dramatic changed, I can't see myself opting out, and leaving that bad taste in my mouth. And in the Charlotte Hornets' mouth. I can't walk away from that.\"\nWhat could be worse than a ninth straight year without playoff basketball for the Sacramento Kings? How about another tumultuous summer, perhaps one featuring DeMarcus Cousins' departure?\nRumors are already swirling about Boogie's availability, courtesy of head coach George Karl's candid comments on Monday.\n\"I've had some great players and I've never had one player that I have said is untradeable,\" Karl said, according to CSNBayArea.com's Bill Herenda. \"You always got to be ready for the possibility of a great trade that could come your way.\n\"I know I respect him (DeMarcus Cousins) a tremendous amount...I think our give and take and our communication has been almost on a daily basis...until we can really get to a special place together, I think we've got to continue to communicate, what he wants and what I want.\"\nThe relationship between star player and coach will be crucial to the Kings' fortunes going forward. Cousins and the Kings seemed ready to thrive early on, when they got off to a 9-6 start under Mike Malone. But Boogie's 10-game absence on account of viral meningitis gave Sacramento's higher-ups the daylight they needed to part ways with Malone. That move ushered in two months of rote mediocrity under interim coach Tyrone Corbin, before Karl came aboard during the All-Star break.\nThough a lukewarm convert to a faster tempo, he has thrived in a system that emphasizes spacing, passing and movement, not unlike Mike Krzyzewski's philosophy last summer with Team USA. It isn't a coincidence that Cousins had triple doubles in two of his last three games and is ranked fifth in the league in scoring (24.1), third in rebounding (12.7) and 11th in blocks (1.75).\nAnd, of course, first in the hearts of Sacramentans.\nCoaching played a pivotal role in the Denver Nuggets' ongoing doldrums this season.\nHead coach Brian Shaw continued to push his square-peg/round-hole approach by playing slow with a team and in a city for which a faster pace would have made more sense. His philosophy backfired, to the tune of a 20-39 start and a subsequent pink slip.\nAccording to Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski, the Nuggets' search for a long-term replacement is already underway. Melvin Hunt, the Nuggets' interim coach, will get a crack at it, though he'll hardly be the only one to get an interview. His competition will likely include former head coaches (Michael Malone, Mike D'Antoni, Alvin Gentry, Scott Skiles), current NBA assistants (Portland's David Vanterpool) and eager college guys looking to make the jump (Florida's Billy Donovan, Iowa State's Fred Hoiberg).\n\"I'm not a coach, but I do think we're Denver,\" said general manager Tim Connelly, per The Denver Post's Chris Dempsey. \"We've got to play with pace, we've got to play uptempo basketball. And uptempo basketball can take on various styles. We're certainly looking for a coach that understands how we've been successful in the past and probably how we'll be successful in the future, with fast basketball and playing with pace.\"\nWhatever hopes the Phoenix Suns had of battling for the West's No. 8 seed for the second year in a row went right out the window during a 1-10 stretch over the final three weeks of the 2014-15 season.\n\"I don't think that truly reflects where we are and the season we had,\" said Suns president Lon Babby during the team's exit interviews, according to AZCentral.com's Paul Coro.\nPerhaps not, though the fact that Phoenix bobbed its way into and out of the playoff race as often as it did was reflective of an unsteady situation on the court and in the locker room.\n\"We didn't have all guys that were just concerned with winning,\" head coach Jeff Hornacek said, per Coro. That much was clear once Goran Dragic publicly demanded a trade (and got his wish) and Isaiah Thomas followed him out the door at the February deadline, albeit to a different destination.\nAll told, the Suns' point guard experiment didn't pay off like they'd hoped. Fortunately for folks in Phoenix, the team will be flush with cap space to restock the roster, once the front office decides how to spend its fifth straight lottery pick.\n\"This year was more of a humbling experience,\" said general manager Ryan McDonough, per Coro. \"I think we'll all learn from it and get better from it and bounce back.\"\nA busy season will give way to an even busier summer for Detroit Pistons head coach/team president Stan Van Gundy. The shocking decision to cut Josh Smith in December breathed new life into the slumping squad. The trade-deadline arrival of Reggie Jackson eventually did the same, albeit after a slump in the wake of Brandon Jennings' Achilles tear.\n\"We made some progress—not enough—but some progress at both ends of the floor,\" Van Gundy said during his exit interview, according to MLive's Brendan Savage. \"Going forward, we feel like we've established a base of good young players. Over the last two-thirds of the year, which is not a small sample size, we played.500 basketball, which would have put us in the top five in the East over that time period.\n\"So we think things are looking up going forward.\"\nHow Detroit's fortunes fare from here on out will depend on what Van Gundy is able to accomplish from his front-office post this summer. Come July 1, Greg Monroe will be an unrestricted free agent, Jackson will be restricted, and Andre Drummond will be eligible for a sizable contract extension. Those three aside, the Pistons figure to make a pitch to at least one Michigan native: Golden State's Draymond Green.\nIf Van Gundy plays his cards right, his Pistons might (finally) be in position to snap their six-year playoff drought next spring.\nLast year, the Miami Heat finished up in the NBA Finals, fighting an ultimately futile battle for their third straight championship. This year, their summer will start two months earlier, without a seventh straight playoff appearance.\nThe biggest difference, of course, is LeBron James. He left South Beach; therefore, the sands aren't quite as warm as they otherwise would be for the Heat.\nBut the story of Miami's demise is much broader than that. Between Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts, Luol Deng and Hassan Whiteside, the Heat racked up frequent flyer miles going to and from the training room to cover the cost of travel for their summer vacations.\n\"It's just tough, man,\" Deng told Bleacher Report's Ethan Skolnick. \"It's just been that type of year. It seemed like the whole year, we were always fighting and dealing with something, instead of staying consistent and just kind of playing our game. I'm not making excuses or anything, but no one on this team can tell you that they've had a consistent rhythm the entire year. It's been tough to be consistent. We've had guys in and out. You have different roles.\"\nThose roles may be more defined next season if Pat Riley has his way in the coming months. With better health and the retention of Goran Dragic and Deng, both opt-out candidates, the Heat could field one of the best starting fives not only in the East but in the entire league.\nLose either or both of those guys, though, and Miami's path back to relevance might not be so smooth.\nPaul George's comeback from his devastating leg injury serves as an all-too-perfect microcosm of the Indiana Pacers' season as a whole.\nLike their wounded superstar, the Pacers fought through pain, uncertainty and doubt to put themselves in position to control their own destiny at the end. Aside from George, Indiana had to survive lengthy stretches without stalwarts like David West and George Hill, along with newcomers Rodney Stuckey and C.J. Miles.\nAgainst all odds, the Pacers hung around the muck at the bottom of the Eastern Conference playoff picture, just in time for George to return to action. His mere presence gave Indiana a much-needed shot in the arm; the Pacers won their first five games with George in the rotation, despite him never playing more than 18 minutes in a given game.\nBut, on the final night of the season, the calf in George's other leg gave way, as did the Pacers' postseason hopes in Memphis.\n\"Just came off a screen and felt a pop, but they looked at it and it's nothing more than just a calf strain,\" George said afterward, according to The Indianapolis Star's Candace Buckner. \"It wasn't a knee injury but it's tough, you work so hard in rehab and have something else pop up. The good thing is, I know we've got a long summer and a lot to look forward to.\"\nSo do the Pacers, assuming West and Roy Hibbert—both of whom can opt out of their contracts—don't leave Naptown this summer.\nRussell Westbrook's response to his first scoring title could easily double as the Oklahoma City Thunder's thoughts on this lost season of theirs.\n\"S---. It doesn't mean nothing,\" Westbrook said after OKC's season-ending win over the Timberwolves, according to ESPN.com's Royce Young (h/t Bleacher Report). \"Good job. Hooray. I'm at home, watching other teams play. Doesn't mean nothing.\"\nWestbrook's disappointment is understandable, if not downright appropriate. He wound up with career highs in nearly every counting category, including points (28.1), assists (8.6), rebounds (7.3) and steals (2.1).\nBut Westbrook's best efforts weren't enough to overcome devastating injuries to Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka. Nor could general manager Sam Presti's moves make up for those losses, though the additions of Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, D.J. Augustin and Kyle Singler should serve the Thunder well going forward.\nWith that supporting cast in place and its stars in better shape, OKC should find itself back in the title hunt next season.\nWhether Scott Brooks is there to guide the Thunder is another story. According to Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski, the team will evaluate its relationship with Brooks, who has one year left on his contract—much like the injured superstar whose absence doomed OKC.\nLionel Hollins' assessment of his Brooklyn Nets' chances against the Atlanta Hawks was as harsh as it was accurate.\n\"I don't think we have any advantages over the Hawks,\" Hollins said, per The Brooklyn Game's Devin Kharpertian.\nThat may sell his team a bit short. Surely, Atlanta doesn't have anyone who can compare with Brook Lopez's size and skill in the post. Lopez finished the season on an absolute tear, averaging 23.7 points and 9.4 rebounds over a 16-game stretch that saw the Nets go 11-5.\nNor can the Hawks claim to boast the best individual perimeter player in this series. That distinction belongs to Brooklyn, courtesy of former ATL resident Joe Johnson.\nOther than those points of contention, Hollins is probably right. By and large, Brooklyn has been mediocre and uninspiring this season.\nThen again, as much of a sting as Hollins' comments may have carried, they still paled in comparison to the five-alarm fire that spewed out from Paul Pierce's mouth, courtesy of ESPN Boston's Jackie MacMullan.\nLost amid the hubbub over Paul Pierce ripping the Nets a new one in public were his comments regarding the Toronto Raptors, the Washington Wizards' first-round playoff opponent.\n\"We haven't done particularly well against Toronto, but I don't feel they have the'It' that makes you worried,\" Pierce told ESPNBoston.com's Jackie MacMullan. \"There isn't a team I look at in the Eastern Conference that makes me say,'They are intimidating, we don't have a chance.'\"\nTo Pierce's point, the Raptors swept the Wizards in their three regular-season meetings. But the most recent two of those tiffs were decided by a total of six points.\nAnd if the games are close between Toronto and Washington, Pierce certainly won't be one to hide from the moment, especially in Canada.\nForget about all the usual tropes about how terrible the Eastern Conference is and how that somehow degrades the Milwaukee Bucks' finish as the sixth seed. The fact that the Bucks are in the playoffs at all right now is nothing short of a Wisconsin miracle.\nMilwaukee won a league-worst 15 games last season and could have plunged back to similar depths this time around in light of all the setbacks this squad suffered over the course of 2014-15. Instead, the Bucks fought through injuries (Jabari Parker, Ersan Ilyasova, John Henson), trades (Brandon Knight) and outright defections (Larry Sanders) to nearly triple their win total from a season ago.\nAnd how, pray tell, did they do it? Among other things, behind a long-armed, switch-heavy defense—orchestrated by head coach Jason Kidd—that wound up second in the league in efficiency, per NBA.com.\nThese fans hate each other, too. This isn't a theory — it's scientific fact proven by years of mutual enmity between Bears and Packers fans. Now imagine that same level of anger and hostility, but on a basketball court. Spectacular, right? Joakim Noah calling Giannis Antetokounmpo soft in the playoffs could create our first Internet civil war. Now imagine future battles between Chicago South Side natives and Simeon's own Jabari Parker and Derrick Rose. I can't take it.\nThe Boston Celtics needed quite a bit of outside help to secure a spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Between the Cleveland Cavaliers resting their stars during a recent home-and-home with Boston and the rest of the East's fringes falling off, the C's benefited from a conference-wide \"effort\" to get them into the postseason—in addition to their own 24-12 surge over the final 36 games.\nBut it was another outside assist that might have given a certain Celtic the extra energy he needed to nudge this scrappy squad up the standings. According to The Boston Globe's Adam Himmelsbach, Isiah Thomas—who had his fair share of battles with the C's as a member of the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons in the 1980s—texted words of encouragement to Isaiah Thomas upon the latter's arrival in Beantown at the Feb. 19 trade deadline.\n\"This is gonna change your career,\" Zeke wrote. \"They're one game out of the playoffs. Lead them to the playoffs.\"\nThat's precisely what the younger Thomas did while averaging 19 points and 5.4 assists off the bench.\nThomas could use a few more texts like that from his almost-namesake in the days to come, as his C's prepare to take on LeBron James' Cavs in the first round of the playoffs.\nNo team did more to boost its collective stock after the All-Star Game than the Utah Jazz. Once the break came and went, the Jazz went 19-10—the fifth-best record in the West—while holding opponents to a league-low 94.8 points per 100 possessions, per NBA.com.\nEnes Kanter's trade-deadline departure and Rudy Gobert's subsequent explosion as a starter had plenty to do with that. For his efforts, Gobert figures to garner plenty of votes for Most Improved and Defensive Player of the Year honors.\nOf course, Gobert wasn't the sole reason Utah finished with a record good enough to qualify for the playoffs in the East. Gordon Hayward's borderline All-NBA play had plenty to do with it, as did Derrick Favors'. As Grantland's Zach Lowe wrote of that duo, \"They've been really good on both ends, and Hayward carried Utah's offense without much help from any perimeter threat until Rodney Hood emerged over the last 25 games.\"\n\"Clearly we sit here today in a better position than when we started,\" general manager Dennis Lindsey said during the team's exit interviews, according to The Salt Lake Tribune's Aaron Falk. \"The group is moving in the right direction.\"\nIf three-point shooting is, indeed, all the rage in the NBA, then the Toronto Raptors are as fashionable as any team around. They finished among the top 10 in three-point makes and attempts, went 19-2 when they made more than 10 threes in a given game and became the second team in league history with five players who knocked down at least 100 treys apiece.\nThe only other team to pull that off? The 2008-09 Knicks.\nOf course, this year's Raptors fared far better than those Knicks did. New York lost 50 games that year. Toronto, on the other hand, fell just one win shy of 50 on the other side of the ledger but still came away with a second straight Atlantic Division title and a franchise record for victories in a single season.\nNext up: a first-round date with the shooting-averse Wizards, whom the Raptors swept during the regular season.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers aren't short of reasons to worry about their postseason prospects. Their wing depth has been decimated by injuries, with Wesley Matthews, Arron Afflalo, Nicolas Batum, Dorell Wright and C.J. McCollum all falling victim. Worse still, the Blazers will have to begin their playoff push on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies.\nHalfway through the season, Portland looked like a dark-horse contender — a two-way powerhouse seasoned with rare roster continuity and some playoff experience. Their starters could hit the marks of Terry Stotts's \"flow\" offense while wearing blindfolds, and they had improbably sharpened into a borderline top-five defensive team.\nDespite the doom and gloom around Rip City, the Blazers still have two huge factors in their favor: LaMarcus Aldridge and Damian Lillard. Those two carried Portland past Houston in last year's playoffs, combining for 55.3 points, 17.5 rebounds and 8.7 assists in a six-game victory.\nThe Memphis Grizzlies won't exactly be a picture of health for their first-round series against Portland, either. Marc Gasol returned from a sprained ankle in time for the Grizzlies' season finale, but he wasn't joined by Mike Conley and Tony Allen. They've been sidelined by foot and hamstring injuries, respectively, and may remain so for some time, per The Commercial Appeal's Ronald Tillery.\nThose absences figure to be massively problematic for Memphis, despite the decimation that Portland has suffered. As much as the Grizzlies' universe revolves around Gasol and Zach Randolph in the middle, it's Conley, who would otherwise be charged with checking Damian Lillard, and Allen (aka \"The Grindfather\") who serve as the heart and soul of this squad.\nThere are many ways to compare the strength of the West to the weakness of the East, but perhaps none is more striking than where the Dallas Mavericks stand at season's end.\nIn the Western Conference, the Mavs' 50 wins were only good enough to snag the seventh seed. Were Dallas an Eastern Conference squad, it would start the playoffs at No. 3, matched up against the Bucks in the first round.\nInstead, the Mavs will have to face the Houston Rockets in a series whose subplots have their own subplots.\n\"That's for the media to talk about,\" Dirk Nowitzki said, referring to the off-court drama between Mavs owner Mark Cuban and Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, per Mavs.com's Earl K. Sneed. \"That's for fun little side notes, I guess, which the players don't really care that much about. It's about which team comes out at the end. Obviously, they have home-court advantage. We'd love to go down there and steal one or steal the first one, but it's going to be tough.\"\nIt'll be even tougher if Chandler Parsons—one of the sticking points in the ongoing feud between these two teams—isn't ready to play in Game 1. He missed the last six games of the regular season while resting his swollen right knee.\nHead coach Rick Carlisle, though, is confident that Parsons will be available. Parsons' offensive versatility and familiarity with Dallas' Texas foe will be vital to the Mavs' attempt to spring the seeded upset.\nFor every transcendent superstar, there is an initial foray into the playoffs, one that sets the stage for the years to come.\nIn 2006, LeBron James averaged about 31 points, eight boards and six assists while carrying the Cleveland Cavaliers to a second-round loss against the Detroit Pistons. In 2010, Kevin Durant poured in 25 points per game (albeit on a subpar 35 percent shooting) in a six-game loss to the eventual-champion Lakers.\nWhat will 2015 bring for Anthony Davis? Probably not much in the way of victories. His New Orleans Pelicans will have to contend with a Golden State Warriors squad that is coming off a historically great regular season.\nHowever Davis fares from here on out, folks in the Crescent City won't soon forget what The Brow did to put the Pelicans back into the playoffs for the first time since 2011, when they were still the New Orleans Hornets. In what was, to date, the biggest game of his NBA career, Davis dominated the streaking San Antonio Spurs, piling up 31 points, 13 rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks in 43 minutes of a 108-103 win for New Orleans.\n\"Honestly, I know I all told ya'll before this game it didn't mean nothing, but I tried to downplay it because I didn't want to get too excited,\" Davis said afterward, via ESPN. \"It meant a lot—and we played like it meant something.\n\"We played our hearts out.\"\nNow, they'll have to locate their hearts and put them back in place, lest they let the Warriors stomp them from the get-go.\nPhysically speaking, Derrick Rose may not be the same player he was prior to his three knee surgeries. But from a confidence standpoint, he's as sturdy as ever.\n\"I believe I'm one of the best players in the NBA...still,\" Rose insisted, even after leaving the Chicago Bulls' season finale early with soreness in his left knee, per ESPN.com's Nick Friedell.\nThe Bulls can only hope Rose's confidence will pay actual dividends in the playoffs. With Joakim Noah, Taj Gibson and Kirk Hinrich all battling injuries, Chicago will need whatever it can squeeze out of the former MVP if it's going to be more than a dark horse in the East.\nAfter all the ups and downs, the injuries and roster changes, the Houston Rockets wound up with the No. 2 seed in the West—which probably beats out most preseason predictions.\nIt's one thing to snag such prime seeding on the strength of James Harden's MVP-caliber campaign. It's another thing to capitalize on it.\nTo that end, the Rockets may have help on the way if they can stay alive long enough. Patrick Beverley, who was recently ruled out for the season after undergoing wrist surgery, could be back at point guard in Houston...assuming the team hasn't been eliminated by mid-May.\n\"I don't care about the pain. I can play through pain. I've been playing through all type of stuff the whole year, so I can play with the pain,\" Beverley told Fox26 Sports' Mark Berman. \"I just have to get this cast off. When the cast comes off May 18, May 20th, wrap it up with tape and (I'll) be good to go. I don't care how weak it is. I don't care how strong it is. I don't care about that.\n\"As soon as this cast is off I'm back to business.\"\nIn the meantime, the Rockets will have to contend with the likes of Rajon Rondo and Tony Parker at the point, with the hope that whatever Harden, Dwight Howard and their supporting cast can do will be enough to see Houston through to the Western Conference Finals.\nHowever and whenever the Atlanta Hawks' surprising season winds up, they can take pride in what they've accomplished together. Despite turmoil at the front-office and ownership levels, the Hawks managed to set new franchise records for consecutive wins (19), All-Stars (four) and total single-season victories, among other things.\nIn the bigger picture, the Hawks earned the respect of the rest of the league, which could pay off handsomely (i.e., via free-agent signings) in the years to come.\n\"I think there's been a couple of times during a game, end of games, when we're gonna win, and the other team will come up and say'man, I love how you guys play,'\" Kyle Korver told NBA.com's David Aldridge. \"They just got, you can tell, they're like, I would love to play for your team. That's the ultimate sign of respect in the NBA. When you're on a team, and your team's supposedly good, but man, I'd rather be on your team. It feels good to hear that.\"\nYou know what would beat that? The Hawks' first trip to the penultimate round of the playoffs since 1970.\nRemember when all the Chicken Littles huddled in northeast Ohio (and across the country, for that matter) were wondering why the sky was falling on the Cleveland Cavaliers and how they'd ever survive it?\nA second-place conference finish did wonders to erase memories of the panic that set in amid the Cavs' disappointing 19-20 start. Cleveland now looks like the favorite to win the East (and a co-favorite to win it all), thanks in no small part to a second half that saw the Cavs win 34 of 43 games.\nWell, maybe not right away. The Cavs should make quick work of the Celtics in Round 1.\nAfter that, though, Cleveland's path through Chicago and Atlanta will put this team's title-contending chops to the test.\nThere were eight scenarios for a first-round playoff opponent for the Clippers heading into Wednesday’s final day of the regular season.\nFour of the scenarios had the Clippers playing the Memphis Grizzlies for the third time in four years.\nTwo of the scenarios had them facing Dallas and one had them meeting Houston in the first round.\nThe last scenario – a scenario some would classify as worst-case – had the Clippers, the league’s second-hottest team, facing the San Antonio Spurs, the hottest.\nAnd wouldn’t you know it, the worst case became the reality.\nThe Clippers, though, aren't about to complain about their cruel fate. \"I'd rather go through them now while we're fresh,\" said DeAndre Jordan, per ESPN.com's Arash Markazi.\nThey'll have to hope that their own season-ending hot streak (seven in a row, 14 of 15) gives them enough juice to overcome a San Antonio Spurs squad that was riding an 11-game spurt prior to a defeat to the Pelicans in the finale.\nHas there ever been a stronger sixth seed in any postseason in any sport than this year's San Antonio Spurs? All they did was win 11 games in a row and 21 of 24 prior to the season's final night. They might have made it 12 in a row and 22 of 25 if not for a poor opening to what turned out to be a 108-103 defeat in New Orleans.\n\"That first half was the worst we've played in a long time,\" head coach Gregg Popovich said afterward, via ESPN. \"The Pelicans were on fire. They were committed. They were playing hard. They had a lot to play for and it showed.\"\nThe Spurs had plenty to play for themselves. A win would have locked them into the No. 2 seed in the West as the Southwest Division champions, with a first-round matchup against the Mavericks. Instead, San Antonio will begin its title defense in L.A., opposite a Clippers team that the Spurs swept out of the second round three years ago.\nTiago Splitter's ongoing calf troubles have cast some doubt on San Antonio's chances of repeating. But if the Spurs can get him back in time for the Western Conference Finals, they'll pose a serious threat to Golden State's dream season.\nA great regular season guarantees the Golden State Warriors nothing more than the No. 1 seed in the West and a pitfall-filled path to the NBA Finals.\nAnd, of course, the No. 1 spot in the last power rankings of the regular season.\nTo be sure, the Dubs didn't just coast their way to the top. Rather, they fought to the very end for each of the 67 wins they racked up.\nStephen Curry certainly didn't take anything for granted. Over the final 18 games of the season, the presumptive MVP knocked down 52.3 percent of his long-range looks on the way to shattering his own record for single-season three-point makes (286).\nAs easy as Golden State made the regular season seem, the playoffs will look like anything but that. First comes figuring out how to contain Anthony Davis. Then, the Warriors will likely have to contend with the \"Grit-N-Grind\" Grizzlies.\nAnd before the Dubs can book their first trip to the Finals in 40 years, the defending champion Spurs will have a word or two to offer.\nGolden State had better hope, then, that the same stroke that helped Curry knocked down more than half of his treys over the last month of the season and another 77 in a row in a single practice holds true during the pressure cooker of the playoffs.\nJosh Martin covers the NBA for Bleacher Report.

        "text": "Next up is the point & figure chart for GLD, the gold exchange traded fund. It shows a bullish trend with a significant upside price projection.\nBelow is one of our favorites: the long term chart of gold going back to 1975.\nAs you can clearly see, prices peaked in the late 70's at over $750.00, and have recently rallied up to $730.40. In the process a cup formation has been constructed on the chart. Presently gold has been in a trading range just below the rim of the cup on the right hand side of the chart.\nIf the POG rallies back up through its $730.40 high and on through $750.00 - a very strong cup with a handle formation will be in place with a break out that would signify the gold bull is very strong and entering a new phase. We expect that to happen this year, possibly within a few months time.\nNext is the industrial metals compared to the price of gold. Since late October of 2006 gold has been out performing the industrial metals, which prior to that time had been the leader.\nSince the peak in late October of 2006, gold has been out performing until about mid-Feb. of 2007. From mid-Feb. to mid-March the industrial metals rallied back to their fib retracement level of 61.8%, and have since started to fall once again, meaning gold has been out performing as of late.\nBelow is the chart of the silver exchange traded fund (SLV). It is presently right at the top of a resistance band and is trying to break out above. A close above 135 that holds would be bullish.\nThe second chart below is the point and figure chart for silver, which shows a bullish price projection of $21.50.\nThe Hui Index was down 3.20 for the week, closing out at 337.66 (-0.94%). The daily chart below shows a symmetrical triangle that is getting narrower by the day. Price will soon break out to the upside or downside.\nNotice the series of higher lows that have been kept in place. Significant resistance resides overhead just over the 360 level.\nNext up is another daily chart of the Hui; this one has a much shorter time frame, and tends to focus in on the more recent price action.\nNotice the Bollinger bands on the chart. The upper BB is at 348.67 and the lower one is at 315.60. In between the two is the middle band at 332.17.\nThe index just recently banged up against the upper BB line and has since retreated to 337.66, which is 5 points above the middle BB. If prices do not hold right around the middle band then the lower band will become a target. Stochastics are turning over and down.\nBelow is the point and figure chart for gold that shows a bullish price project of 412.\nReadings of 5 or higher have coincided with oversold levels and market bottoms. A spike back above 5 from which the ratio has recently fallen would most likely give a good entry point.\nBelow are some gold stocks that we own or have owned in our portfolio and are watching for further possible accumulation.\nWe are cautious with the overall stock market and sense there is more downside to come. We prefer to stay on the sidelines except with selected precious metal and energy stocks.\nEven with the pm and energy stocks one most remain cautious, as any serious downdraft in the overall market will most likely affect all stocks. We do not see any imminent danger, but storm clouds on the distant horizon.\nAny surprises with interest rates will be to the upside. This is because of the derivative mess and carry trade orgies, which when they start to unwind will cause quite a stir.\nThe world is afloat with paper fiat debt money. The sub-prime problems will get worse before they get better, not only in the US but elsewhere as well.\nThe Fed and other CB's will react to these events as they do to all events: they create more credit and debt. This will not be unseen by gold, as a matter of fact gold will sound the warning before hand.\nShort term the gold stocks appear overbought and in need of a bit more rest/consolidation before beginning a sustainable leg up. We look to accumulate selected stocks on weakness that holds above previous lows.\nStop by our website and check out the complete market wrap, which covers most major markets. There is also a lot of information on gold and silver, not only from an investment point of view, but also from its position as being the mandated monetary system of our Constitution - Silver and Gold Coins as in Honest Weights and Measures.\nThere is also a live bulletin board where you can discuss the markets with people from around the world and many other resources too numerous to list. Drop by and check it out. Good luck. Good trading. Good health. And that's a wrap."

        "text": "Why unemployment in IT sector is on rise?\nIn January 2015, Tata Consultancy Services, India’s largest software services firm, fired approximately 25,000 software engineers. This event inaugurated a new trend in India’s globally-connected IT industry. In 2017, growing layoffs finally sparked a national debate. News reports and interviews with IT employees confirm that leading companies, that only a few years ago were aggressively recruiting new employees, are not only hiring in relatively small numbers but are actively pushing employees out.\nA drop in the hiring rates will affect the tens of thousands of engineering graduates who aspire to enter the IT workforce as they encounter firms that are reluctant to hire in the volumes of the preceding two decades. The claims and findings presented below are based on ongoing research that commenced in 2014 and relies on over 100 in-depth interviews.\nDownsizing is not temporary The era of labour-intensive growth in IT is over and job creation will occur at a decelerated pace. The expansion of India’s IT sector has depended on the IT investments that large American and European companies make into their own IT systems. Quantitative and qualitative shifts in the “IT spend” of client corporations instantly affect the firms to which IT development and maintenance tasks are subcontracted.\nSimplifications in the way enterprises organise, develop and maintain their IT infrastructure implies an erosion of back-office IT work that typically has been offshored. Cloud computing centralises IT infrastructure and enables companies to share computing resources. Secondly, new software programmes automate certain labour-intensive tasks such as software testing and IT helpdesk functions. Restructuring contributing to job losses New employees (1-5 years of experience) do not receive the quick promotions and salary hikes that have defined the IT industry.\nHowever, their jobs are (relatively) protected by the fact that to the firm they represent cheap labour at the bottom of the pyramid. Mid-career professionals who joined the industry roughly in the 2000-2010 period bear the brunt of the cost-cutting drive that grips today’s firms. Despite the industry’s attempt to cast the irrelevance of the middle managers as an issue of skill-deficiency, the fact is that middle managers are expensive in the eyes of the company.\nmaking project requirements ever-changing. Many interviewees discussed the dual pressure they face from their clients as well as their own managers (who themselves are at risk of losing jobs). The pressure, they say, to produce ‘more from less’ has never been greater. New areas are not labour-intensive. The boom in technology-intensive start-ups (both consumer and business facing) has opened up a new area of employment for an educated, upwardly mobile, young workforce, particularly for highly-skilled software engineers – but also recruits for sales, marketing and product management divisions.\nLarge IT companies are also looking to make specialised, targeted hires, particularly in areas like cloud security and data analytics. With the erosion of labour-intensive tasks of software testing, integration and maintenance, hiring will always be modest compared to the ‘golden years’ of expansion. Start-ups are of course much smaller (in terms of employees) and aim for high labour productivity (revenue per employee). Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that this is a volatile sector, fueled by venture capital and business models that privilege sales and user growth over profitability and therefore we can presume that many fledgling companies will fail, merge or be acquired."

        "text": "Spain's new parliament convenes after the June 26 general election, but absent from the chamber will be either a parliamentary majority or a working cross-party agreement. As David Pollard reports, the political deadlock raises new questions over a fragile economic recovery.\nSpain's acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy has survived two inconclusive elections in seven months but his party's parliamentary majority has not. As the house gathered to nominate a new speaker, the Popular Party is still the largest. But without a cross-party agreement, little progress appears possible. Especially as the opposition Socialists are still holding out - and refusing to endorse a Rajoy-led government. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CMC MARKETS ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: \"This political mix where no party really comes ahead is probably something we're going to see for the next re-election as well and Spain's going to stuck here without any real political direction.\" There was one boost for Rajoy. Public works minister Ana Pastor of the People's Party was nominated as parliamentary speaker. Rajoy's government has enjoyed support from investors for his reform programmes. And though crippling high unemployment still blights its recovery, growth this year is seen coming in at 2.7 per cent or above. Fears that Spain's political deadlock could result in an economic logjam could, say some analysts, be overdone. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CMC MARKETS ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: \"Uncertainty is a bad thing.... The other line of thought is that without a government meddling too much, maybe the market forces are able to take over, the people in Spain given a bit more confidence to go out there and act in their own economic best interests, and that eventually Spain can just muddle forward.\" Rajoy could face a first vote of confidence on any new proposals next month - if he can get the backing he needs beforehand."

        "text": "Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh is “moderate” and “pragmatic,” while Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu leads a “radical” and “extremist” government.\nThese descriptions are all from the news pages of the largest and most influential newspaper of the Spanish-speaking world, El País, and represent its approach to reporting on the region.\nEl País claims Hamas leader is moderate and Netanyahu’s government is extremist.\nThe year 2009 marked a turning point. The newspaper changed its approach to the region with more balanced reporting. Tel Aviv ceased to be incorrectly identified as the capital of Israel and articles from the Middle East began to include viewpoints from both sides of the conflict.\nOver the past year, however, El País has drifted back to its previous pattern, disregarding the voice of one of the parties in the conflict.\nIt is now rare to see the perspectives of any Israeli who does not sharply condemn his or her own country in the newspaper. For example, for the 49th anniversary of the “occupation,” El País published a series of articles, graphics and photographs over the course of a month that were authored by the paper’s correspondent, as well as other envoys to the area. Because these were not time-sensitive, breaking news stories, journalists had the opportunity to contextualize and delve into the background of the conflict. Yet none of the articles included a single voice explaining the situation from an Israeli viewpoint.\nThe day after an Israeli 13 years old girl was assassinated, El País dedicated its front page to the “Ravages of the Occupation”.\nWith the death of Hallel, there are already 33 Israelis killed in the wave of violence that began last October and which also killed two Americans, an Eritrean immigrant – lynched in Beer Sheba, having been mistaken for an assailant – and about 220 Palestinians.\nThe newspaper gives no indication that most of the 220 Palestinians were attackers.\nWhen the newspaper does include an Israeli viewpoint in its reports, it is generally in the form of a press release or an official statement. This is entirely different from the frequent first-person testimonies and interviews with Palestinians or organizations representing them.\nAn exception to this is the newspaper’s citing of Israeli organizations that focus on attacking their own country. For example, Breaking The Silence, an Israeli-based NGO whose mission is to “expose” alleged war crimes by Israeli soldiers, invited journalists and executives from El País to visit the area, guided by the organization’s ideologically- biased point of view. This organization’s voice became a prominent one in the newspaper’s reports –mentioned in about twenty articles published in the last two years. But nowhere in all that coverage, did the newspaper mention the fact that the NGO is mired in controversy. There is nothing about the fact that the “testimonies” that form the foundation of the organization’s exposés are anonymous and unverifiable, based on hearsay, which gives rise to much skepticism about the veracity of the allegations.\nThus, the only Israeli voices given room in El País are those that reinforce an anti-Israel narrative.\nBetween the offices of the young Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, Tzipi Hotovely in Jerusalem, and the one of the historic Palestinian leader, Hanan Ashrawi in Ramallah, there are less than 20 kilometers, but the distance separating their political speeches is unbridgeable. Hotovely reflects the mentality of a broad sector of Israeli society that aspires to control all disputed territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean. Ashrawi, who has spent her entire adult life under the Israeli occupation, like most Palestinians, wields the international resolutions that protect the rights of her people, although they have not been fulfilled.\nIn fact, polls show that a majority of Israelis support a two state solution, while a minority of Palestinians do.\nIt is not uncommon to read opinion columns in the newspaper that promote the work of openly belligerent, anti-Israel organizations. Recently, the daily published one such piece followed by a request for readers to financially support UNRWA, an agency that caters exclusively to those they classify as Palestinian refugees, as well as their descendents. Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC), an organization that boycotts Israel, was also given a platform in El País to spread its message. Both organizations were presented as neutral actors or observers – without any mention of their anti-Israel agenda.\nEl Pais asks its readers to support UNRWA at the botton of an op-ed. This call to action was removed after complaints.\nOne wonders, especially if he is Andalusian, what would have been our response had the heirs of the Syrian Umayyads decided, following the tragedy they are suffering, to settle in Andalusia, the homeland of their ancestors. It is not necessary to go very far to predict the violent rejection that this would have generated.\nOf course, Andalusia was never the homeland of the Umayyads. But at El País, truth is apparently expendable in the pursuit of demonizing Israel.\nIn another example of uncorrected error, El País published a piece claiming that the new Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation provides no news because of a Knesset law forcing the channel to split into two departments (El País called it “segregated news”). This is false. The Israeli Supreme Court overturned that law and the channel did in fact provide news programming. The newspaper was alerted to the error but issued no correction, and the false information remains on its website.\nAt left, wrong information that can still be read in El País‘ site claiming the news department was “segregated” in KAN. At right, the Jerusalem Post explains this did not occur.\nA special mention should be made of the partisan lexicon that is routinely used. “Occupied Palestinian Territories,” “1967 borders,” “illegal occupation under international law,” etc., all terminology that is generally avoided –for good reasons- in the mainstream English-speaking media.\n, and which conceals from its readers the nuances and subtleties of the story.\nIt is important to remember that all binding agreements and resolutions call on the parties to resolve the conflict –including the territorial conflict- through negotiation. Until that happens, those territories are not (as they, in fact, never were) Palestinian. The 1967 dividing lines were simply armistice lines, never a border. The word “border” implies legality, political significance, and permanence, none of which applies in this case.\nCAMERA`s Spanish department contacted the paper to inquire about their refusal to change the erroneous language, but didn’t receive a response.\nUnfortunately, the combination of a narrow selection of sources (without fact-checking) along with the biased and unprofessional way of covering events taking place in the region is a very common phenomenon in Spanish media, but in the case of El País, the leading newspaper in the Spanish-speaking world, it is especially worrisome. Taking into account that Spanish is the second most-spoken language in the world, the unilateral and misleading message that fills its pages on a daily basis reaches a good part of the global population. In fact, the newspaper defines itself as “the global newspaper,” and not in vain does it have its own “America” edition.\nReading the articles of El País conveys the impression that the occupation appeared by spontaneous generation, always framing it as the cause of the conflict. Actually, there is almost no mention of any responsibility that Palestinian leaders might have for the suffering of their own people and for the continuity of the conflict. In short, Palestinians are portrayed in El Pais‘ coverage as objects irremediably exposed to external action: always reacting to Israeli actions.\nIt is true that from time to time the newspaper publishes an isolated op-ed in which the author tries to show another perspective — perhaps an article about Israeli start-ups or one about the success of agricultural technology. But one wonders how many cherry tomatoes are needed to offset the constant rain of errors, distortions, and omissions like the ones that are disseminated to the massive Spanish-speaking population across the world.\nA shorter version of this article was originally published in the Gatestone Institute.\nMasha Gabriel Masha Gabriel is Director of ReVista de Medio Oriente (CAMERA's Spanish Language Division). Born in Argentina and raised in Spain, Masha monitors the Spanish-language media in monitors media from Spain, Latin America, and the U.S. and tries to ensure that reporting about Israel and the region is balanced and accurate. With a background in journalism, television, and film, Masha has intimate knowledge of Spain's journalistic world. In her previous capacity as director of a Madrid radio program, she interviewed journalists and politicians from around the world."

Actually really not a good example. In the UK we decided to leave cars and alcohol alone, but come down hard on the combination. Drink driving was explicitly banned in the UK in 1967. By 1979 (first year of statistics) there were 1640 deaths on the road where one driver was drunk. Last year it was 200. And it's been down to a consistent 230-240 for the last six years.\"\nThe US has similar rules governing alcohol in combination with both cars and guns. The former were enacted during roughly the same period that you mention, albeit with less extreme results: We used to attribute roughly half of fatal auto accidents to alcohol, but by the time the total number of deaths peaked several years ago, it was down to a third.\nIt's complicated to estimate because US states use different definitions of intoxication, and reporting is inconsistent both geographically and over time.\nWhere I am, it's illegal to carry a pistol if you have any detectable alcohol in your blood. (The standard for driving is 0.08%.) It's also illegal to carry one in public without a permit."

        "text": "Sometimes, she says, she is out on Dublin bay in her Laser and wonders why she didn’t pick a team sport, asks herself why it has ended up like this?\nThere are no regrets, no second guessing her choices, no criticism of the sport she loves. Just passing thoughts on how things become the way they become?\nHow it is she ended up a solo sailor, alone for hours trimming fractions from her boat and from the wind and two stone from her body to coax her Laser to go faster?\nHere in Dun Laoghaire they fondly call her Annalise, an Olympian who carries her status lightly. People know her name, know what she looks like. After Rio they hung a giant poster of her down the side of the National Yacht Club and each morning the commuters driving to into the city and the people walking the east pier, could share the pride.\nAround here the Murphy is silent. She is simply Annalise like Sonia remains Sonia and Katie has always been Katie.\nShe says she is naturally gregarious and that doing it on her own, the hours on the water in Rio or Dublin Bay and recently in Lisbon, can get lonely.\nTalking up her success and position in sailing is anathema to her and if she does, it is guarded and almost begrudging. She is tough on herself. She has anxiety about her ability, questions whether she can do the things people expect of her, will it all be a success or a big flat belly flop? And all this after Rio.\n“I’m still the same person,” she says. “I don’t think the Olympic Games changed me that much. I still have the exact same fears that I had before.\n“I’ve got a little bit more confidence in my sailing ability, but not that much more. I still have fears that that I’m not going to be good enough.\nIt’s an eternally searching position from a sailor who dramatically fell off the podium in London 2012, then turned a crisis of confidence into a silver medal.\nWhen she knew everyone was watching to see if she would fall, she rose. Rio and Irish Olympic history now define her.\nStill, the confidence wanes and grows with each achievement, the doubt an incitement to drive and build. Her internal disposition is a steady stream of self provocation. It never allows her stay still.\nToday though, she has her eyes on the world and all of its water in the Volvo Ocean Race. The name alone is majestic in its breadth and sweep. From her solo success, Annalise has ‘crewed up’.\nFor almost a year, the boat will own her. As one of 10 she has now declared herself a team player.\n“I get lonely all the time,” she explains. “I don’t really like being by myself. Generally I like to be around people, hang out with people. Chat away.\nShe has more plunged than dipped her toe into the high end of muscle boats, the Ocean going Volvo 65 designed specifically for the race.\nNo paint on the inside, just a black carbon canvas. Spare. “It’s dark downside,” she says. A coat of paint to brighten it would be another layer of weight. Too much.\nAll seven teams in the 45,000 nautical mile journey have exactly the same boat, one design and an allowance of two sets of sails for the entire race, a restriction to stop money talking too loudly.\nThe bunk beds are sweet, she says. They are rigged to a pulley system so if it’s rough the crew can haul themselves the whole way up and wedge against the carbon fibre wall, snug like a burrito on a grill.\nIt means in their four hours on, four hours off around the clock roster they don’t flip into the water sloshing around inside the sleeping quarters.\nPrior to her recent stints of training she had never slept overnight on a boat. Whether it was racing her Olympic Laser, or against men in the foiling Moths, she has been successfully sailing, but until now it had always been a few hours on the bay then back to shore.\n“I’ve only ever slept on this boat. I’d 48 hours, the longest I’ve been on it,” she says, coolly pocketing that challenge.\n“Being thrown into this team is refreshing. It’s a whole group of people doing the same thing and all wanting the same outcome.\n“It’s cool. It’s different. It’s terrifying, the whole race. It’s so hard. I think it’s going to make me feel that Olympic sailing was the easiest thing in the world. Not in terms of the technical preparation but in terms of the mental attitude.\nThe first leg from Lisbon in Portugal to Alacante in Spain is a sprint, 700 nautical miles, the same as around Ireland and only few days ride. Leg three, Cape Town to Melbourne is 6,500 miles and leg seven, Auckland to Itaja in Brazil may define their race.\nIt’s the longest leg and cruel, 7,600 nautical miles and almost all of it through some of the coldest, roughest ocean in the world.\nThe fleet leaves Auckland on March 18th and heads south past New Zealand’s East Cape and into the Southern Ocean.\nOnce far enough south they will turn and race from west to east, catching the low pressure systems circulating around Antarctica. There will be big seas. There will be big winds. And there will be icebergs.\nOnce across that vast expanse of wilderness the boats take on the legendary Cape Horn and turn north, following the coast of Argentina, Uruguay and finally Brazil and Itajaí.\n“Excited. Terrified,” says Annalise of the challenge ahead. “Worried about the dangers involved in the race.... I’m looking forward to what our team can do.... we are young and enthusiastic.\n“I guess my family are excited for me. They are definitely worried. But they’ve done mad things as well in their life.\nFor all of her wise cracking and underplay she is the most successful female sailor Ireland has ever had. Those who watch carefully know that her natural cheer is authentic and the gallows humour her way of deflecting from a talent and success that keeps moving forward.\nOcean racers are not Olympic racers. Like frontiersmen, mountaineers or free divers they bear the miles of endurance like battle scars. The moulded unadorned fibreglass interiors are not so much a disdain for comfort as preparedness for sacrifice.\nShe throws a pitying smile when hardship is mentioned. It’s as though comfort is the most virulent kind of serial killer. She is empathetic, benevolent and kindly to a land lubber. But unflinching.\n“I think people have dealt with worse than not showering for three weeks. I don’t think it’s going to be a deal breaker,” she says calmly. “I guess we’ll all be smelly together.\n“I feel it’s going to be the best thing I can do. This is the first time I have thought I could actually do professional sailing. It’s hard when you are just an Olympic sailor. You are so well skilled but if you want to get onto a big boat, to be a tactician.... this gives me opportunity.\n“I mean Olympic sailing is so hard and I’m hard on myself.\n“I found it very difficult between London and Rio because I started to sail badly in 2014 and then my whole idea of an Olympic medal began to disappear. I thought maybe it’s not going to happen for me, that I’m going to work so hard over the next years and I’m just not good enough.\n“I couldn’t even see the light at the end of the tunnel. All I could see was three more years. Do I have to do three more years of this? Feeling that I’m not good enough. That I’m never going to get to where I want to get to. This gives me a perfect 10 month break even though I’ll be sailing 24 hours a day.\nThe boat ‘Turn The Tide On Plastic’ has an overt environmental theme as well as gender equality. There is an even split of five men and five women. Most of the crew are under 30.\nVeteran Irish sailor Damian Foxall is also in the race and part of the Vestas team. He has competed in five Volvo Ocean Races and won it as part of Groupama in 2011-12.\nHe also set a round-the-world speed record onboard G-Class catamaran Cheyenne. Kerry of course, he is a Derrynane boy gripped with ocean fever.\nFoxall has fallen overboard in the race only to be picked up by a boat that was coincidentally taking the same course. In five-metre waves 1,200 miles from land, Dutch friend Hans Horrevoets was fatally washed away from ABN AMRO.\nDeath is there and all the sailors know it. But it is not what the race is about. It is an eye opening, life changing voyage.\n“Oh,” Murphy adds. “I’m the medic too.” She raises her arm in the air to show the veins running from her wrist along the inside of her forearm and describes her efforts to insert a canella. The simple medical procedure becames a splatter movie with blood fizzing into the air like a shaken bottle of cola.\nShe recites the drill as if by rote.\n“We have a camping gas stove. We have a kettle. Pour it into the freeze dried. Mix the freeze dried. Leave it to rehydrate. Eat it. Make sure you leave it for 15 minutes. Otherwise it will make you sick.\n“It will be hard for me mentally every day to get through each day,” she adds more earnestly. “When you are on each leg you have to think that it is never going to end. You can’t be counting down the days. It’s an endurance test. You have to think like that. That’s mentally very hard.\nAsked for five words that define what she is doing, how she feels about casting off and she gives back 59. Ideas and emotions swim in her head, almost in overload, banging off each other.\nAnd off she goes rubbing her lower forehead for the imaginary lost eyebrows. Off she goes, infectious, self deprecating, talented, doubting, conquering. Off she goes to discover a new world.\nThe total distance for the 2017-18 edition will be 45,000 nautical miles and is the longest route in the history of the race that was formerly known as the Whitbread Round the World Race. It typically sailed a distance of about 32,000 nautical miles.\nA total of 12,500 nautical miles will be raced in the Southern Ocean, a hostile, freezing environment renowned for boat-breaking storms and gruelling conditions. Most stages of the race range in length from 700 to 6,500 nautical miles. Port stopovers are usually less than two weeks in duration but there are also several ‘pit-stops’ of just a few days at key locations.\nThe fleet comprises seven teams while an eighth - for which a brand-new boat is available - did not materialise.\nOut of 77 sailors, there are a total of 18 female sailors, the biggest proportion ever following a concerted effort by the organisers to ensure teams would be mixed. As an incentive, teams opting for an all-male line-up must race with fewer crew; none have taken this option. Teams are also required to have under 30’s included in their crew panel.\nThere are 28 sailors participating for the first time and 14 sailors across the seven teams that have won the race before. There will be 18 nations represented in the total crew line-up.\nAnnalise Murphy is one of several Rio 2012 Olympic medallists selected to compete in this race. Her inclusion required a crash course in offshore sailing including Sea Survival training, Yachtmaster theory courses as well as medical training as she is also the designated medic on board “Turn the Tide on Plastic”. She has not previously competed in an offshore/trans-oceanic race.\nIreland has been represented in the race on winning teams on three separate occasions. Cork sailor Justin Slattery won the race in 2005-2006 on board ABN AMRO 1 with skipper Mike Sanderson. He also won the last edition of the race with Ian Walker on Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing. Kerryman Damian Foxall won the race in 2011-12 with French skipper Franck Cammas on Groupama, lifting the trophy on home turf as that edition of the race finished in Galway.\nMurphy is only the third Irish woman to compete in this round the world race. Previously, Susan Kavanagh raced on Norsk Data in the 1985-86 Whitbread. Angela Farrell raced in the first all-woman team with Tracy Edwards on Maiden in the 1989-90 race.\nIreland has had two previous flagged entries in the race. NCB Ireland was the Irish designed and built 82-foot maxi skippered by the late Joe English that competed in the 1989-90 Whitbread race. Green Dragon skippered by Ian Walker competed in the 2008-09 Volvo Ocean Race. Both projects were conceived by Galway’s Enda O’Coineen who mounted his own Vendee Globe solo ocean race entry last year that ended prematurely with a dismasting close to New Zealand’s South Island."

        "text": "Newark Symphony Hall last month completed $1.5 million in roof repairs and safety upgrades that made the 84-year-old deteriorating building on Broad Street habitable as a rental facility. But the work falls far short of a more significant investment needed to address years of neglect and return the building that once hosted such artistic greats as Marian Anderson and George Gershwin to its former stature.\nTo rebuild Symphony Hall, its nonprofit operators will launch a $40 million capital campaign by next spring to generate public and private philanthropy for the needed renovations, which include new stage lighting; sound, heating and air-conditioning expansions; and other infrastructure improvements.\nCarl Miller, a maintenance worker, at the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall's new theater at Newark Symphony Hall, which has undergone a $1.5 million renovation.\nCombined with city, county and state funding, the building's managers hope enough money is raised to complete the kind of renovations seen in recent years at the Union County Performing Arts Center in Rahway and the Welmont Theater in Montclair.\n\"It's legacy needs to be preserved for future generations. We should be trying to maintain the historical venues that we have in the City of Newark, as opposed to let them deteriorate and become inactive,\" said Philip S. Thomas, executive director of the Newark Performing Arts Corp.\nOn Saturday, the public is invited to help the city, which owns the building, and the hall's operators design the venue's future at a daylong conference billed as \"Newark Symphony Hall Reimagined.\"\nNewark Mayor Cory Booker, who spurred symphony hall's renewal, said people have an interest in preserving the building that was once a gem in the city's downtown.\n\"That facility has a very strong hold on the spirit and the imagination of a lot of residents here, and many residents have great stories about seeing shows and concerts or just going to events there as well,\" Booker said.\nDespite the recession, City Council President Mildred Crump said she is confident the campaign to raise funds will be a success.\n\"Mindful of the fact that these are very difficult times, there are still people out there who were around when Newark Symphony Hall was where you went,\" said Crump, who serves on hall's board of directors.\nThe building, also known as the Mosque and originally built by the Shriners as a Masonic Temple in 1925, had been the state's premier venue for a variety of famed entertainers and theater groups. Marian Anderson, William Warfield, George Gershwin, Tony Bennett and Patti LaBelle were among the major stars whose names went up on the marquee.\nThe New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, New Jersey Ballet, New Jersey State Opera and African Globe Theater also have used the building. In addition, two television stations -- WNET Channel 13 and the Spanish-language WNJU Channel 47 -- have made their home in the hall.\nChanging priorities for the city, however, brought an era of deferred maintenance to the building, leaving it to deteriorate over the past two decades. With increasing competition from other area venues, fewer groups rented the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall, Terrace Ballroom and a second-floor theater.\nTenants who leased office space on the third and fourth floors also departed when water damage from a leaking roof made the spaces uninhabitable.\nOver the years, periodic repair work was done, but it wasn't enough, Thomas said.\n\"If you're making constant repairs to the building, then it's going to start looking shabby. And if you're not replacing broken or worn-out or outdated mechanical systems, then they're going to break down.\" he said.\nIn 2007, the Newark Performing Arts Council hired Thomas, a former vice president at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, to manage Newark Symphony Hall.\nThomas reduced a deficit in annual operating expenses from more than $400,000 in 2007 to just over $65,000 last year, according to an update he prepared for the city council in February.\nHe said he reduced costs by making hard decisions, such as canceling a summer program for about 100 Newark children one year and cutting his staff from 19 to 15 employees. Symphony Hall operates on a $2.1 million annual budget and relies on rentals of the building, tenant leases, concession revenues and a $650,000 donation from the city each year.\nLast year, the city invested $1.5 million for the roof repair and to help to bring the building up to city codes. Electric exit signs, emergency lighting, panic bars on doors and a computerized fire and smoke alarm system were installed for the entire building.\nThomas said the work was the minimum for making Symphony Hall safe and that it was now primed for a major renovation.\nSymphony Hall has already received a $30,000 grant from PSEG Foundation to create a strategic plan. Crump said she also hopes to gain state support this week from New Jersey's Secretary of State Nina Wells and Jason Tramm, maestro of the New Jersey State Opera. The opera, she said, expects to return to Symphony Hall in 2010.\nSaturday's conference, featuring NJPAC President Lawrence P. Goldman and Newark historian Clement Price as speakers, begins at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 5:30 p.m. Registration forms are available at the box office. Crump said she already has her vision of how the building should be reimagined.\n\"It takes me back to the day when you walked the red carpet as you entered Newark Symphony Hall,\" she said. \"It takes me back to the day when every seat was filled.\"\n\"Historic music hall has brighter days ahead\""

        "text": "Political surveys and their results consume a large part of the political discourse. Political officials at many different levels of government have come to rely on them as representing their constituents' preferences on current issues. However, research indicates surveys may have shortcomings which can affect valued democratic qualities (equality, for one). This brings into question their ability to accurately represent the public view. Many United States citizens do not feel that they can affect government actions. Voting is the citizen's domain, often after the candidates have been chosen.\nPolitical scientists have recognized and bemoaned the voter ignorance and apathy displayed prominently in survey research, but have for the most part ignored the causes. While they admit the shortcomings of surveys, they have not evaluated their use by politicians or attempted to measure surveys' effects relative to conceptions of democratic ideals within the broader society.\nThis thesis does not seek to establish our dependence on surveys as the origin of voter apathy; there are many contributing factors to political culture. It is the intention of this thesis to examine the shortcomings of surveys, how they are used, and the ways in which they result in undemocratic effects. A proposed plan for change is then introduced with the hope that it can remedy some of these ills.\nKagan, Nancy H., \"An Evaluation of Political Surveys and Their Consequences for Democracy\" (2009).

Locked up in lieu of $500,000 bond, Deemie is charged with burglary, home invasion, criminal damage, and possession of a stolen vehicle.\nPictured at right, Deemie faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the felony counts.\nAccording to investigators, Deemie was under the influence of narcotics on February 17 when he became convinced that a zombie invasion was nigh. Deemie is accused of breaking into the home of a neighbor, Larhonda Gonzalez, around 3 AM and stealing the keys to her Ford Escape.\nDeemie then drove the stolen SUV to the Peoria airport, where he sought to crash into the terminal. He then somehow bypassed security and got aboard an empty plane parked on the tarmac.\nDeemie subsequently fled the stationary plane and, with the aid of a brick, tried to break into a Peoria County Sheriff’s Office squad car that was parked nearby. As first reported by the Journal Star, Deemie planned to drive the cop car to Florida."

        "text": "The eccentric PayPal billionaire doesn’t just invest in Silicon Valley tech companies. He’s giving money for crazy projects that do everything from get power from the weather to find ways to program human cells like computers.\nPaypal Co-Founder Peter Thiel isn’t the kind of guy who invests in mindless smartphone apps that make lots of cash. He’s not anti-software by any means; he has sunk millions into accounting software company Xero. But Thiel also doles out cash to companies doing things that aren’t just world-changing–they seem insane (in a good way). Could we expect anything less from the guy that’s funding a floating startup incubator for foreign entrepreneurs?\nThiel’s latest investment–a $300,000 bet–is in AVEtec, a startup from Canadian engineer Louis Michaud that wants to harness the energy created by tornados. Michaud doesn’t want to chase tornados a la Twister; he plans to generate man-made tornados that can be safely switched off if necessary.\nMichaud’s design features warm air blown into a hollow cylinder, where it turns into a “controlled vortex” (aka a tornado) that’s supported by the temperature difference between the heated air in the cylinder and the atmosphere. No carbon emissions are produced, no energy storage is required, the device can produce 200 megawatts of electrical power (the same as a coal power plant) and power can potentially be produced at just three cents per kilowatt hour.\nNow Michaud just needs to build the proof of concept–a project that will be helped along by Thiel’s cash. He’s working on a 131-foot-tall, 26-foot-in-diameter prototype at Lambton College in Ontario.\nAVEtec is one of 12 startups that Thiel is funding through Breakout Labs, a program of the Thiel Foundation that the organization calls “a revolutionary, revolving funding model through which successful projects fund the next generation of daring scientific exploration.” Some of our other favorites are listed below.\nAn alligator purse that doesn’t require killing an animal. A burger that keeps cows intact. That’s the far-out dream of Modern Meadow, a startup that could have test tube leather ready for large-scale production in five years. To make leather, the startup biopsies a living animal, isolates the necessary cells, multiplies them in a bioreactor, centrifuges them into spheres of thousands of cells, layers and fuses cell aggregates, matures the cells in a bioreactor, and harvests the skin tissue. All for your guilt-free leather accessory.\n“At this point, the goal is to create products that are both biomimetic–very, very similar to real leather–and also to look at ways that we can improve upon it and make products that are superior to traditional leather,” CEO Andras Forgacs told Co.Exist in an interview earlier this year. Down the line, Modern Meadow will move into test tube meat. Why buy a cow when you can get the meat from a lab?\nThis company has the ambitious goal of creating a universal system for gathering and identifying airborne toxins. The research for the project is being conducted at the Northwestern University Department of Biomedical Engineering.\nInspirotec is working on two different models: a portable air collector that collects samples which can be analyzed in a lab (available in 2013), and a more-ambitious sounding next-generation portable collector that allows for real-time monitoring. The Inspirotec website explains that “It is based on well-established biological detection methods and connects with smart devices allowing for mobile applications.” Funding from Breakout will be used to create a proof-of-concept device.\nThis startup, founded by a computer security expert, is taking a programmer’s approach to disease treatment: The company wants to program patients’ cells to become tiny drug factories. The website explains: “Within 50 years, we will program human cells like we program computers. Envision a stand-alone device capable of modifying a patient’s cells to manufacture biologic-based therapies for a wide range of disease including cardiovascular disease, cancers, infectious diseases, and lysosomal storage diseases. Programming a patient’s cells to manufacture their own treatments could dramatically reduce therapy costs.” With the price for certain cancer treatments hovering over $100,000 per year, that’s a big deal.\nWithin 50 years, we will program human cells like we program computers.\nImmosoft is testing its methods first with a rare genetic disease called MPS I. If the company is successful, it will program the human immune system to generate cells that secrete enzymes to treat the disease, first in genetically modified mice before moving on eventually to humans. Immusoft has already conducted a proof of concept for its treatment where B cells were modified from a healthy human to create antibodies that neutralize HIV.\nOrgan transplants are tricky, time-sensitive things–if an organ isn’t transplanted within hours, there’s a decent chance it will be rejected. That doesn’t bode well for patients, who may have a perfectly good organ waiting for them–on the other side of the world. Arigos Biomedical is working on high-speed methods to cool organs for long-term preservation. One day, patients may be able to receive organs that have been preserved for months or even longer.\nArigos doesn’t have a website (that we can find, anyway), but co-founder Tanya Jones told the Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal: “We’ve done all the math that we can do to prove that this method will work … now it’s a matter of actually beginning to use organs. We are hoping to basically have all the pictures and all the proof necessary.” First up: testing the technology with animal organs.\nCheck out all of Breakout Labs’ investments here."

        "text": "Housing secretary James Brokenshire announced today (29 November) that under new legislation, combustible materials will not be permitted in the external walls of new buildings over 18m tall and containing housing.\nThe Ministry of Housing confirmed the ban would also apply to new hospitals, residential care premises, dormitories in boarding schools and student accommodation over 18m tall. The new regulations will limit the use of materials in the external walls to products achieving a European fire-resistance classification of Class A1 or A2.\nThe ban, which only applies to new buildings, will come into effect on 21 December.\nThe government has also gone some way to clearing up confusion over which parts of the buildings the ban will apply to, and in particular, what it means by ‘external wall’.\nIn the amended legislation, external wall is defined as anything ‘located within any space forming part of the wall’ and any decoration or finishes applied to external surfaces.\nIt also comprises windows or doors, roofs pitched at an angle of more than 70 degrees as well as balconies, devices for deflecting sunlight and solar panels.\nThe AJ understands this definition is likely to have implications for timber-frame high-rises and architects and developers using the cross-laminated timber (CLT) construction method.\nThe government’s impact assessment of the policy points out it ’prohibits the use of timber materials in the external wall of buildings within the scope’.\nBrokenshire also announced that local authorities would get the full backing of the government, including financial support, to remove combustible cladding from privately owned high-rise blocks.\nThe ban comes after months of warnings issued to building owners not to pass on costs of removing unsafe cladding to leaseholders.\nThe government is already fully funding the replacement of unsafe ACM cladding on publicly owned blocks above 18m.\nBrokenshire said: ‘Everyone has a right to feel safe in their homes and I have repeatedly made clear that building owners and developers must replace dangerous ACM cladding. And the costs must not be passed on to leaseholders.\nThis is indeed an interesting move that should have been introduced from the outset in the design of high rise structures. Bearing in mind that 40% of fires Worldwide are caused by electrical cable malfunction it is imperative that the electrical cable is also taken into account. Cables are taken the length and breadth of every building and cables have been frequently known to assist in the spread of fire in highrise buildings. Most electrical cables will burn and emit smoke and toxic fumes.\n1. How about existing high-rise blocks, built in the 70-ties, 80-ties etc.\n2. Who will pay for the removal of such cladding materials if the building is owned by a local authority? Leaseholders?"

My children (non-Muslims) have to stand in the open field to endure the doa (Islamic prayer) reading by the ustaz and face regular onslaught from the ustaz questioning their faith at this young age.\nIs that a national school or an agama (religious) school?\nSabahan: Hopefully, this is due to a few teachers who have betrayed the trust given to them by the Orang Asli parents to teach their children.\nYears ago, my neighbour's daughter, a non-Muslim bumiputera, was given a place in a Mara Junior Science Colleges (MRSM) school in Peninsular Malaysia.\nDuring the fasting month, the school has to provide meals for her and a few East Malaysian non-Muslim bumiputeras during the day. Very soon, they were urged by a Muslim teacher to become Muslims as so not to trouble the kitchen staff during the fasting hours.\nMy neighbour quickly removed his daughter from the school. Like I said earlier, these are the actions of a few misguided teachers.\nLawan Tetap Lawan: If it was the other way around, there would be street protests aided by the police and MPs calling for the sacking of the teacher.\nLamborghini: The Orang Asli has been bullied and intimidated and suppressed for far too long. They are the true native inhabitants, the real bumiputeras of this land and yet they are treated as the lowest and least of our citizens.\nBecause of their ignorance and meekness, their rights have been trampled upon and their lands robbed from them and now their children being forced to convert to a faith not of their choosing.\nTo all of you who are bullying, intimidating and taking advantage of the Orang Asli, stop it for God's sake.\nWe should all instead do our very best to genuinely help them to develop to become more educated, healthy and respected citizens in our country.\nThese true bumiputeras deserve and need our genuine help, compassion and support, not our greed and evil intentions and wicked actions.\nThe teacher concerned and others like him must be brought to justice for their contemptible actions against the innocent Orang Asli children.\nP Dev Anand Pillai: It will soon happen in other rural areas if we don't fight back. Their next targets will be the Indians, who are now ranked behind the Indonesian Muslims as the fourth or fifth in terms of population.\nThey will never touch the well-connected ones, their target will be the rural ones. So let's change the bargaining position by ensuring that there are at least two representatives from Hindraf and Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM) in Parliament this time around.\n2zzzxxx: Imagine if they were Muslim children and slapped for not reciting a non-Muslim prayer.\nJati president Hasan Ali and Perkasa president Ibrahim Ali and all of Umno will by now have descended on the streets and screaming to have the teacher hung.\nChipmunk: This is why all Malays should be taught about respecting other religions. They must know that freedom of religion is part of the constitution.\nMost SK (sekolah kebangsaan) and SMK (sekolah menengah kebangsaan) schools try to force non-Muslims to recite the doa and this is utterly wrong.\nWill the education minister and the prime minister take action on this matter or just turn a deaf ear to this? How would you feel if non-Malays forced their religion onto Muslims? Will you like that?\nSo please, for the sake of racial integration, stop this kampung attitude and wake up to reality.\n3rdEye: Stop the rot now. Malaysians must be free to choose and Malaysian parents be allowed to decide what is needed for their children.\nThe teacher, Education Ministry and Orang Asli Development Department (JHEOA) must take responsibility, apologise and ensure this does not repeat, both in East and West Malaysia.\nGeronimo: Now you can understand why the Chinese educationalists are resisting the posting of Malay teachers to Chinese schools.\nClearly, there is a bigger agenda here then meets the eye. When PM Najib Abdul Razak studied in St John's Institution, I wonder whether the LaSalle brothers forced him to say grace before he eats.\nSwipenter: If nothing is done to stop such incidents and proper disciplinary action taken against the offender, one day you would be slapped for not looking like them.\nHopeful Doc: If the Muslims dislike being proselytised, why are they doing the same to others? Transferring misbehaving government servants will not solve any problem. They must be suspended and demoted. This is to ensure they will think twice before doing anything.\nAnonymous #18452573: Bigotry is the by-product of racism. This is just another form of ethnocentrism and xenophobia due to BN's 50 years of racially divided political parties and racist policies.\nIslam, Christianity and other religions are inherently good and encourage unity against evil. It is people who are brought up with bad policies and divisive politics who are capable of doing bad, regardless of the religion they profess.\nBujangSenang: \"Any man or woman who neglects to maintain inward vigilance, and only makes an outward show of holiness in dress, speech, and behaviour, is a wretched creature.\n\"For they watch the doings of other people and criticise their faults, imagining themselves to be something when in reality they are nothing.\n\"In this way they deceive themselves. Be careful to avoid this, and devote yourself inwardly to His likeness by humility, charity, and other spiritual virtues. In this way you will be truly converted to God.\" - Walter Hilton."

Beyond having the opportunity to — you know — sit next to the first lady, the dozen or so people chosen will end up on the national stage for the evening. At a speech that outlines President Obama's priorities for the next year, the guest list helps the White House to send a message about the issues the president considers most important.\nLast year, for example, one of the key themes of Obama's speech was a push to ensure the wealthiest Americans paid their fair share of taxes — the so-called \"Buffett Rule.\" The White House invited billionaire investor Warren Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek, to sit with the first lady. In the speech, the president spoke of her to make his point that it was unfair for a billionaire's secretary to pay a higher tax rate than her boss.\nAlso in the first lady's box last year was former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot in 2011 along with 18 others in Tucson. When Obama entered the House chamber, he stopped to give Giffords a hug, which was met by a standing ovation. Up-and-coming Democrat Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, also got an invite last year.\nSo, in a year when the president is likely to highlight legislative priorities such as gun control, immigration reform, and \"balanced\" deficit reduction, who will end up on the White House guest list? Newtown families? The latest recipient of the Medal of Honor? An undocumented worker?\nThat's where you, the readers, come in.

Highlight any text on a page and an icon pops up. Click on the icon and a host of different actions (such as Search with Flickr or Map with Google Maps) show up. Here’s an example: Highlight an address on a page, click on the Accelerator icon, select Search with Google Maps, and see a mini-map of that location from within the same page.\nAnother feature, Web slices, lets you track sites from your favorites bar. For instance, you can track an ebay auction or a stock price without having to navigate to a different page.\nLapsen also showed me the tab isolation in IE8 (if one site crashes, others don’t), as well as how the domain (like microsoft.com) is highlighted in the address bar when users navigate to a site, so they can more easily identify if they are at a malicious copycat site.\nSome of those features (such as tab isolation) were released with Google’s Chrome earlier this fall. But Lapsen said that was not surprising."

        "text": "Massachusetts has always been a source of innovative ideas that change the world, from the revolutionary principles that gave birth to democracy to the technological concepts that founded Facebook. But when it comes to our zoning, subdivision and planning laws, our state is still stuck a half century behind the curve.\nYet that could change. There is a growing movement to reform the state’s antiquated and confusing laws that govern development. We aim to create a more predictable set of rules that will encourage good planning and good projects so that our cities and towns can enjoy the kinds of walkable, vibrant places where people want to live and work. To be successful, we need to pass legislation pending on Beacon Hill that will simplify the zoning process for the benefit of municipalities, residents, and property owners across MetroWest and throughout the Commonwealth.\nCurrent laws do not promote development that meets the needs of Massachusetts residents in 2013, much less in the years to come. We’re building fewer than half of the homes needed to house current residents, and we’re often building in ways that don’t use our land and resources responsibly. It’s time for some common sense that works in everyone’s interests.\nKnown as House Bill 1859 or “An Act Promoting the Planning and Development of Sustainable Communities,” our reform package has earned 58 co-sponsors since being introduced, including Sen. James Eldridge (D-Acton).\nThe proposal will make it quicker and cheaper for communities to decide where to sensibly grow by making master planning optional and more flexible. It encourages communities to establish districts for prompt permitting of housing and commercial growth while adopting environmental protections. With our proposal, the permitting process would become more rational for developers and the community. Instead of navigating a gamut of local boards individually, developers of major projects could submit a common application to all boards simultaneously and be granted a joint public hearing within 45 days of filing.\nLet’s take development fights out of the courts. This bill brings our zoning law into the 21st century and clarifies many gray areas of the law so that everyone understands what they mean. A few examples include: inclusionary zoning to encourage affordable housing, impact fees to help offset the costs of development, and form-based codes that promote good design. Furthermore, we eliminate several loopholes that make it possible for developers or municipalities to game the system. Our legislation would create reasonable and standardized zoning protections once a building permit, special permit, or subdivision plan is approved. In the event of a disagreement on land use proposals, there will be an opportunity for a neutral facilitator to come in and settle the dispute instead of enduring costly and time-consuming court battles. The appeal process is streamlined to save everyone time and money.\nOur antiquated zoning laws hurt our environment as well. Every day in Massachusetts, 22 acres of forest and farmland are converted primarily to low-density residential sprawl. This is due in part to “Approval Not Required” (ANR) development, which is almost unregulated. We are the only state in the nation that allows this. Our reform proposal would enable a city or town to replace that ANR with an expedited review process to minimize haphazard development and preserve important landscapes in our communities. There are also provisions to encourage the sensitive placement of development as well as recharge our aquifers to reduce flooding.\nOne of Massachusetts’ greatest strengths is the diversity of its cities and towns. There are dense urban areas like Somerville, seaside communities like Gloucester, and rural towns like Brimfield. Under these proposed new laws, MetroWest communities and cities and towns in all areas of the state will have the tools they need to lay out their vision for the future while preserving the character that makes them unique. Increasing our stock of moderately priced and affordable homes in a responsible, predictable manner will keep our talented residents here while attracting new people to Massachusetts, strengthening not only our individual towns but the entire Commonwealth.\nThe zoning reform bill is driven by the collective expertise of dozens of organizations including the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance, the Massachusetts Public Health Association, the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association, the Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions, the Massachusetts Association of Planning Directors and many other groups that care about growth and quality of life in our communities.\nWe welcome a public discussion about how to improve development in Massachusetts and we invite you to learn more at the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance website and contact us. We hope you will agree that a more fair and predictable zoning and permitting process will create an attractive environment for investment in our state’s great places.\nAndré Leroux is the executive director of the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance. State Senator Dan Wolf represents the Cape and the Islands."

About 20 people attended the presentation in the Selectboard Meeting Room at the Municipal Center on Feb. 27.\n“I’ve been your watchdog on the budget up to date,” said Steve Horton, project manager on incorporating the oversight committee and town’s input.\n“The priority being the best value for the money and the outcome being the safety and security for the people of Brattleboro,” he said about the scrutinizing the project budget.\nControversy has accompanied the police-fire facilities upgrade project. Bonding for the project has been blamed for a jump in the town’s property taxes for fiscal year 2015.\nThe town’s police station and two fire stations, however, have significant health and safety issues: black mold in the West Brattleboro fire station, and in the police station, which is in the Municipal Center.\nModern fire engines are too heavy for the floor and too big for the doors of the Central Fire Station, which also has air-quality issues.\nThe damp of the police station’s basement damages records.\nThe two largest cost savings have come through changes to the West Brattleboro fire station and police station plans.\nThe project team has recommended building a new West Brattleboro station, rather than renovating the existing station.\nThe project team also decided to build the Police Station addition to the Municipal Center without a basement, said Raymond A. Giolitto, architect with Northeast Collaborative Architects, which is based in Connecticut and Rhode Island.\nThe new Station 2 will be constructed on property adjacent to the existing West Brattleboro fire station. The existing station is undersized, and renovating and expanding it would have required the costly relocation of a sewer tank and emergency generators.\nAccording to Giolitto and Horton, the oversight committee has not decided whether to demolish the outdated West Brattleboro station or to put the building to new use. The exiting station will continue to house firefighters during construction.\nBuilding a new Station 2 will save the project about $200,000.\nNancy Miller questioned whether having a station in West Brattleboro was prudent given the town’s tight finances.\n“I have serious reservations whether we can afford all three sites,” said Miller.\nHorton answered that before construction starts, the town will obtain from the contractor a guaranteed maximum price to help keep the project within budget.\nEarly plans for the Police Department renovations included renovations and expansion of the existing stone foundation of Municipal Center to the tune of $150,000 to $200,000, explained Horton.\n“People think basements are cheap, but they’re not,” said Horton.\nPhillips told the audience that the committee charged Interim Town Manager Patrick Moreland and Horton with evaluating alternative sites for the police station.\nAll the alternative sites proved more expensive than keeping the police station at the Municipal Center, said Phillips.\nGiolitto and Horton also took questions on how the police station addition will affect the Municipal Center’s parking lot.\nThe town anticipates approximately 40 parking spaces, said Giolitto. The parking lot will also become one-way from Grove Street to Main Street for everything but police vehicles.\nHorton told the audience that construction on all three building sites will occur simultaneously. The project team anticipates starting construction this summer. Of the three, the West Brattleboro station has the shortest construction schedule and will likely be completed this year. Central Station should be completed by the summer of 2015. The police station project has the longest timeline and should be completed the end of 2015.\nThe oversight committee has approved the plans for the three stations and will recommend the Selectboard approve the plans.\nOriginally published in The Commons issue #244 (Wednesday, March 5, 2014).

It’s a subject that’s particularly important to me as a lifelong resident of Southern Indiana, where our electric utility, Vectren, has forced consumers to pay the highest electricity rates anywhere in the Midwest — and is now putting forward a plan that would drive those rates even higher.\nWhile Vectren proudly points to essentially flat rates since 2011, those rates are still nearly 40% higher than the Indiana average. Since 2011, Vectren rates have been stable at approximately 15.5 cents/kilowatt-hour. But the average rate for the state of Indiana is 11.31 and was even lower in the past. In fact, Vectren rates are nearly 3 times those charged just across the river in Henderson, Kentucky and 30% higher than Indianapolis Power & Light.\nEnergy powers every part of our lives so high electricity costs have a negative impact on virtually everything we do. Residents in Vectren’s area of coverage who are on a fixed income struggle more than those in areas with more reasonable rates. Businesses are less likely to locate in this area. People are less likely to move here. Property values are lower.\nNow, Vectren is pushing for a plan that would make our electricity prices even higher. It wants to shut down existing generating facilities in order to build a billion dollar natural gas fueled power plant with more capacity.\nIn a time when demand has flattened, excess capacity is not needed. Moreover, Vectren is proposing additional capacity in the form of solar. Of course, solar energy is only available on sunny days and can’t be turned on and off as demand changes. All of this may be great for Vectren’s public image but it's an additional, unnecessary drain on their rate payers.\nVectren management has admitted that the result of all these expenditures will be even higher rates. And what will rates be if natural gas prices spike again as they did in 2008?\nWhy is Vectren pushing for an expensive, unnecessary plan that will harm its customers? Being a for-profit monopoly, Vectren’s profits are regulated. The one and only way that utilities like Vectren can increase total profits is through capital expenditures that are passed on to customers in higher rates. Smart meters? You pay for them. Solar farms? You pay for them. Oversized generating facilities? That’s right, you pay for them.\nIt’s time for the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to demand that Vectren stop placing profits above its obligation to provide customers with affordable and reliable energy, and reject Vectren’s plan to raise our electric bills."

The submission was certified today as containing both the necessary 1,000 valid signatures from registered Ohio voters and a “fair and truthful” summary of the proposed amendment.\nOnce the summary language and initial signatures are certified, the Ohio Ballot Board must determine if the amendment contains a single issue or multiple issues.

Total signatures collected statewide must also equal 10 percent of the total vote cast for the office of governor at the last gubernatorial election.\nThe full text of today’s letter and of the amendment petitions submitted can be found at www.OhioAttorneyGeneral.gov/BallotInitiatives.\nHUSTED ADVISES ELECTION OFFICIALS OF POTENTIAL REGISTRATION FRAUD – Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted today issued Advisory 2015-03, which instructs the election officials at the 88 county boards of elections to carefully analyze new voter registrations being submitted by The Strategy Network, an organization coordinating the signature and registration drives for the pro-marijuana legalization group ResponsibleOhio.\nSecretary Husted is urging local election officials to more closely review these forms following reports from boards of elections of an increase in errors and apparent fraudulent registration attempts from the group’s submissions. This fraudulent activity has been identified in conjunction with voter registration efforts The Strategy Network has been conducting while collecting signatures for their ballot initiative.\nNEW BUSINESS FILINGS RELEASED FOR MAY – Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced 7,945 new entities filed to do business in Ohio during May 2015. This number is a slight improvement from the same period last year when 7,820 new entities filed.\nThe bill is now awaiting the Governor’s signature, and once signed, it will mark the first time this fee has been cut in modern history and will make Ohio the least expensive state in the region to start and maintain a new business.\nThough the most visible role of the Secretary of State is that of chief elections officer, the office is also the first stop for individuals or companies who want to file and start a business in Ohio. While recognizing these numbers can’t provide a complete picture of Ohio’s jobs climate, they are an important indicator of economic activity that Secretary Husted hopes will add to the discussion of how to improve the state’s overall climate for business."

(SKS), which announced last month it is selling off its Proffitt&apos;s and McRae&apos;s department stores, on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter as its mid-price department-store business continues to languish.\nFor the first quarter ended April 30, income was $17.1 million, or 12 cents per share. The latest results include a gain of a penny per share from disposing of closed stores, offset by a penny per share related to expenses from an investigation of alleged improper collections of money from vendors at its Saks Fifth Avenue (search) division.\nOn average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting earnings of 16 cents per share in the latest quarter.\nSales totaled $1.55 billion, a slight 0.6 percent increase from $1.54 billion a year earlier and a bit below the $1.56 billion expected from Wall Street analysts.\nAt all of Saks&apos; stores open at least a year, sales grew 1.9 percent last quarter, with a 5.5 percent increase at Saks Fifth Avenue shops offsetting a 0.9 percent drop in its department-store group.\nSaks did not report its year-ago profit results because it expects to restate financial results for fiscal 1999 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 due to the investigation of markdown money and other related financial and accounting issues.\nMarkdown money is what suppliers pay to compensate stores when they don&apos;t sell products or are forced to take deeper markdowns than expected. Last week, the company announced it fired its chief accounting officer and other top officers as a result of the investigation.\nThe company, which is also the target of an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (search) and U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office in New York, said Tuesday it is working to confirm the amount of total vendor markdown allowances determined to have been improperly collected. As a result, all the results are preliminary and remain subject to change.\nLast month, Saks said it agreed to sell its Proffitt&apos;s (search) and McRae&apos;s department stores (search) to privately held retailer Belk Inc. for $622 million in cash. The stores have annual revenue of about $700 million. The company also said it&apos;s exploring strategic options for its northern mid-price department store division, which consist of 143 stores under the names of Carson, Pirie Scott, Bergner&apos;s, Boston Store, Younkers and Herberger&apos;s.\nShares of Saks fell 12 cents to $16.82 on the New York Stock Exchange."

But it’s Norwich ability to battle back twice in such late circumstances at St Andrew’s that offered the brightest spot of Saturday’s draw.\n“It is what’s normal in football – you never quit,” said Hernandes. “For me, I can never quit. We’ve worked really hard in pre-season and you have to learn in football that you never quit.\n“We had a lot of time. We still had three minutes (of injury time).

The two need to harmonize well together in a perfect combination. It is important that we understand the DNA of both cuisines,” explains Peru’s star chef of the restaurant “Maido” in Lima, a Nikkei concept which ranked seventh in the San Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants 2018.\nFor the new menu at MGM Cotai’s signature Nikkei restaurant, Aji, Tsumura, widely known as Chef Micha, works with his team, led by Chef Edwin Guzman Navarro and Manager Alexandre Santos.\nTheir goal is to elevate the original menu to another level and feature their best efforts and creativity. Additional ingredients from Peru are imported to make the taste profile more complex. The result is an explosion of well-balanced flavors and aesthetics that surprises the senses.\nUmami takes center stage for creations like Causa: mashed potato filled with yellow chilli, king crab, and salmon roe layered on a bed of black rice cracker.\nFor lovers of beef tartar, Aji’s version of the raw beef delight is enhanced with sea urchin, quail egg, and truffle chapla.\nMushroom fanatics will be thrilled by mushroom, shiitake, enoki and king oyster mushroom in broth.\nLastly, the Rocoto, a dessert filled with coconut, cinnamon foam, chocolate praline and peanut ice cream, sweetens the palate with its diverse textures, making it the perfect conclusion to a rich meal characterized by sophisticated combinations and innovative artistry.\nAfter the tasting, the Times sat down with the Nikkei chefs for a conversation.\nMacau Daily Times (MDT) – How do you work with Chef Edwin?\nChef Mitsuharu Tsumura (MT) – I communicate constantly with Edwin. For the first few months of the first year, I was more involved creatively. Now I give ideas, but I would say that 80 or 90 percent of the job is done by [Chefs] Edwin and Aldo. Actually, they come up with ideas and they ask me, “what do you think about this?” And we take the ideas from there. Edwin and Aldo know what kind of flavors I like. I also give him ideas. So it’s team work, but it’s mostly executed by Aldo and Edwin.\nMDT – You talk through Facetime?\nEdwin has always been a very talented and creative chef. He worked with me in Maido. He won the best young chef [award] in Peru, the contest. Edwin has really developed a good relationship with everybody in the hotel, with the team, and outside the hotel. Also in Hong Kong. He is very easy going. When I came this time, I was surprised because everybody knows him and he knows everybody. I feel proud and very happy because before coming here, it was a challenge, but I think he has done very well and engaged with the people.\nMDT – Can you talk about your experience in Macau?\nChef Edwin Guzman Navarro (EGN) – It was a challenge when Mitsuharu made the decision to choose myself and Aldo to come to Macau and develop the concept here in China. It was a challenge looking for products similar to the Peruvian ones and starting to cook with people who don’t know anything about your cuisine and your flavors. But I can say the first year was very good also. We were tired but enjoyed the work.\nMDT – How do you overcome the problem of importing products?\nEGN – When the Hong Kong- Macau-Zhuhai Bridge was finished, we were thinking maybe the problem can be fixed because half of the products [can be found] in Hong Kong, but delivery is not easy. We have some ingredients flown directly from Peru, but it’s very expensive.\nPeruvian cuisine is developing in Asia, more in Hong Kong than in Macau, and the products are going to Hong Kong first and then sent to other places. We are still trying to find new suppliers.\nMDT – And ingredients from Japan?\nEGN – I went with Mitsuharu to Japan and tried the food there. I saw the ingredients, but was not very familiar with all of them. Actually, we always ask Mitsuharu how we should cook with those products that we never saw in our life.\nMDT – What about the kitchen, is it to your liking?\nMT – It’s a dream kitchen. I said when I open this restaurant in Macau, it has to be the kitchen of my dreams. [MGM] hired a designer and everything, but I want to design it myself. So, I went back to Peru and I drew it there. I want this station here, pastry there, etc. Plunger here, walks here. So, it’s not a typical kitchen, it has many stations. It’s like a fish bowl.\nMDT – Is the new menu an elevation of the previous menu?\nMT – We try to make something special for our guests. Engawa, for example, is top quality and a precious part of the fish, but most people don’t know what it is.\nWhen I first went to Japan I didn’t know about it because in Peru, we don’t use it; we throw it away because it’s hard [to cook with]. But now they’re using it. Some 17 years ago or so, my boss in Japan said, “Okay cut the fish.” I cut the fish and left the Engawa and he got mad because I threw it away. “Where’s the Engawa? Why not use that? That is the most expensive part of the fish. That’s worth the same amount as the whole fish,” he added. I’m never going to forget that. If you don’t go very well into the bone of the fish, you can lose half of the Engawa. These tough parts of the fish are the best parts for cooking… because they’re very hard when they are raw, but they are very tender when they are cooked.\nMDT – Who are the clients?\nAlexandre Santos (AS) – Expat and local Chinese community. They accept the food but it is very new for them. You need to really take an effort to explain what the dish is. After opening up the menu, we try our best to go to the table and start to explain.\nMT – I was happy to hear that 80 percent or more of the customers of Aji are locals.\nAS – In the beginning it was like the ‘curiosity stage’ of the whole hotel. It was the first Peruvian and then Nikkei Restaurant in Macau and it was challenging then. […] I got a chance to go to Peru almost a year and a half ago. Chef Micha took me out to many different places, like even fish markets, a French market and different restaurants with different types of cuisine and this overcame a lot of basic challenges, for example, how we can explain the dishes to the guests.\nMDT – Chef Micha, what is your goal for the future?\nMT – I take life day-by-day. I don’t like to plan, but I have to plan sometimes because that’s the way my work is. Many people think I’m very organized, but I am not. When I wake up every day, I try to make my day perfect. But when I plan something too much, it doesn’t work. That has happened to me. So the best things in my life have happened without planning. So, I really don’t know what I’m going to do. One of the things I know I’m going to do is that I’m going to close my restaurant in Lima. Maido is going to close in approximately three or four more years.\nMy concept in Chile and China are basically the only two concepts that are this elaborate. What I open in the future will be very casual. I am not looking to be in a ranking, just [to make] good food at a good price. I want to make my food more democratic. I want to open more concepts where everybody can go. That is happiness. We can make tasty food without it being so expensive. The future of food is informality. Do whatever you want. If you want to eat with your hands, eat with your hands. No dress code. There’s no better way to eat than the way you feel comfortable. I never wear suits, for example. If you tell me I have to dress up to go to a restaurant, I don’t go. I never wear a shirt, that’s the way I am.\nMDT – When did you first hear the word ‘Macau’?\nMT – The first time I heard the word ‘Macau’ was when I was in college because I had two friends from Macau. That was 20 years ago. I said, “Where are you from?” “Macau.” “Where’s Macau?” Macau was not like [it is] now 20 years ago, so he talked about gambling. He said, “We have casinos there and the Portuguese influence and this is Macau.” So, from that time I always remembered Macau in that way and said, someday I’m going to go."

        "text": "Mohammed bin Salman’s selection as crown prince to King Salman bin Abdul Aziz is a positive move for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and U.S.-Saudi relations. While the precise timing of this event was uncertain, the move itself was inevitable given the steady expansion of the now-Crown Prince’s domestic and international portfolio and his role in spearheading the Kingdom’s push toward economic diversification, reform, and answering President Trump’s call for U.S. allies to play a more proactive role in providing for their own security and defense.\nThe transition, occurring under the auspices of King Salman who is, perhaps, the last of the sons of the Kingdom’s founder, King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, with the prestige, stature, and influence to adeptly orchestrate such a significant move, was executed quickly, smoothly, and elegantly and, most importantly, with the strong backing of the Royal Family and the influential clerical establishment. Significantly, former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who had been next-in-line to the throne, quickly and publicly swore baya’a (the oath of allegiance) to Prince Mohammed, a symbolic but significant gesture given by members of the Royal Family and key pillars of Saudi society to signify their support for a new leader.\nThe designation of Mohammed bin Salman as Crown Prince eliminates uncertainty over who would succeed the 81-year-old King Salman. Speculation in the press and on social media, the latter serving as the Kingdom’s public forum, on a looming succession “competition” or, among more histrionic observers, a “crisis” which could have jeopardized the Kingdom’s push for reform, have been put to rest.\nCrown Prince Mohammed’s youth and charisma have made him a popular figure in a country where the median age is approximately twenty-seven.\nThe quick consolidation of the Royal Family behind Crown Prince Mohammed is a clear vote in favor of continuity of current policies; most importantly, the Kingdom’s concerted push toward economic diversification and gradualist political reform, which includes modernizing and restructuring the religious establishment and greater empowerment of women. It is also the clearest indicator that the ongoing generational transfer of power within the Kingdom is permanent. Crown Prince Mohammed’s youth and charisma have made him a popular figure in a country where the median age is approximately twenty-seven.\nIt is also a clear win for the United States. Prince Mohammed is very pro-American and places a premium on the military and security relations – economic and trade relations as well – the two countries enjoy. Following the election, he moved quickly to forge a close connection with the Trump administration; the president’s decision to travel to Riyadh for his first overseas visit happened, in large measure, thanks to the success of Prince Mohammed’s outreach to the White House.\nThe burgeoning relationship between President Trump and the Crown Prince has helped initiate a reset of U.S.-Saudi relations, which had reached a nadir under the Obama administration. This has yielded dividends for the Kingdom – most notably the Trump administration’s decision to expedite a potentially $110 billion arms sale – and for the United States as well. During the Riyadh Summit, President Trump outlined a new foreign policy vision which would not only see key regional allies play a greater role in providing for their own security and defense, but in which regional powers like Saudi Arabia would take the initiative in moving decisively to tackle sources of extremism and terrorism. The Kingdom’s decision, with the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain, to cut diplomatic ties with and isolate Qatar, which has long openly backed anti-American Islamist groups, can be seen, at least in part, as a move by the Crown Prince to support the president’s call.\nThe Kingdom’s decision, with the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain, to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, which has long openly backed anti-American Islamist groups, can be seen in part as a move by the Crown Prince to support President Trump's call to take the initiative in tackling sources of extremism.\nCrown Prince Mohammed is not an unknown quantity. Since becoming Deputy Crown Prince in April 2015, he has effectively served as the Kingdom’s CEO on both foreign and domestic policy. He was the chief architect behind Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia’s blueprint for economic diversification and reform. As chairman of Saudi Aramco, he is playing a key role in restructuring one of the globe’s largest companies and in paving the way for the state-run entity’s IPO later this year. As chairman of the Public Investment Fund, he drove the decision to transform that sleepy institution into the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Prince Mohammed also curbed the powers of the religious police, established the General Authority for Entertainment (part of a larger initiative to promote tourism), introduced new measures to roll back subsidies and levy taxes and established an anti-terrorist alliance of Islamic countries.\nHe first entered government in 2009 as a special advisor to the Governor of Riyadh Province. In 2011, he joined his father, then Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense’s court as a special advisor, serving, over the next few years, as head of the Crown Prince’s Court, Advisor to the Minister of Defense, Governor of Eastern Province, and Minister of State. In 2015, he was appointed Minister of Defense where he oversaw Operation Decisive Storm, the Kingdom’s move to counter the advances of Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. In that year, he also became Secretary-General of the Royal Court and, critically, chairman of the newly-established Council for Economic and Development Affairs.\nIn this context, this appointment is the next logical step in what has been a steady accumulation of responsibilities stretching back eight years. It is a signal of continuity, a win for stability, a win for Saudi reformers, and a win for the United States.\nAli Shihabi is the executive director of the Arabia Foundation (www.ArabiaFoundation.org), a Washington, DC-based think tank focused on the geopolitics of the Arabian Peninsula."

        "text": "Volkswagen joined the sport utility vehicle market a little late, waiting until the 2004 model year to jump in with the Touareg, named after a nomadic desert tribe in the Saharas.\nThough the vehicle never threatened to knock the Ford Explorer and other more mainstream products off the top of the sales perch, it was and remains a solid, well-conceived SUV that genuinely takes its designation seriously. There's sport, and there's utility, in equal measure.\nAs a five-passenger vehicle, a lot of customers who need a third-row seat pass the Touareg by, but for the rest of us, there's an adequate 31 cubic feet of cargo space, which turns into 71 cubic feet with the rear seat folded down. Inside, the Touareg is roomy up front, reasonably spacious for two rear-seat passengers. Instruments and controls are among best in class, and the upholstery and trim has a genuinely premium look and feel.\nIt should because the Touareg isn't, and has never been, cheap. Starting at more than $40,000, our test model topped $53,010, and it didn't have all the available options. One option it did have that raised the price about $3,500: The 3.0-liter, 225-horsepower turbocharged diesel engine.\nDiesels typically cost more to build and almost always get better mileage than gasoline-powered engines, but with the added cost plus the fact that diesel seems to average about 40 to 50 cents a gallon more than regular gasoline, a lot of Touareg customers might stick with the standard 3.6-liter, 280-horsepower gas engine.\nThat said, the diesel does get better mileage — the EPA rates it at 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, while the gasoline engine is rated at 14 mpg city, 19 mpg highway. We averaged nearly 23 mpg in the diesel Touareg, which seems pretty good for a vehicle that weighs 5,304 pounds.\nReally, though, the Touareg is startlingly light on its feet. Handling is typically German, which means precise and controlled, but the ride is smooth, even on uneven surfaces. Where the Touareg has always surprised is off-road. Though it's not a dedicated rock-crawler, the Touareg can take on all but the worst terrain. It has low-range gearing for extra power, and the torque supplied by the diesel engine make it pull like a freight train. It's limited by the tires, though, which are understandably more designed for a quiet highway ride than mud-bogging. The Touareg can also tow more than 7,700 pounds, a lot for a vehicle this size.\nWhile the base-model Touareg has a lot of standard equipment, our tester had a $2,600 luxury package, a $5,200 technology package and a $500 tow hitch that, with shipping, upped the price to $53,010. A lot of those features I could happily do without, especially with so much equipment standard, including a power sunroof, Sirius satellite radio and walnut interior trim. All the safety equipment you'd suspect is standard, too.\nVolkswagen is updating the Touareg for 2011, so it could be a good time to make a deal on a 2010 at a hungry VW dealer. A year-end discount could fix the only real problem I've ever had with the Touareg — the window sticker.\nNutshell: Plenty of sport, lots of utility."

        "text": "With Easter a month away and grass an easy crop to grow, why not consider a hand-painted terra-cotta pot filled with a bed of real grass? Finished off with a cloth ribbon handle, it's the perfect place to rest Easter treats and eggs decorated with natural dyes.\nIf you decide to create a ribbon handle, you'll need to drill holes in to the terra-cotta. Wearing safety goggles, drill two holes, one on each side of the pot, about 1/2 inch from the edge of the rim. As you drill, use light pressure to prevent the pot from cracking. Dust away powder.\nCover the inside of the pot with two to three coats of a water-based polyurethane sealant. While it dries, apply two to three coats of acrylic or latex base paint to the outside of the pot and the 2-inch lip inside the pot.\nThere are a variety of painting techniques to use when designing your basket. Regardless of the technique used, apply a few coats of a water-based polyurethane sealant over your finished design and allow to dry overnight before proceeding to the next step.\nPlace shard or gravel at the bottom of the pot and over the hole to allow for water drainage. Fill soil just up to 2 inches below top and work in a small amount of fertilizer. Sprinkle seeds onto soil, rake seeds with fork, and water with a spray bottle. Use this watering method until seeds sprout and roots are established. Place in a window and water every couple of days, keeping the top of the soil moist at all times. Once the roots have been established, adjust the watering schedule to once or twice a week. Growing time for grass is around four to five weeks.\nThe sun will fade the ribbon and possibly your painted design, so attach the ribbon after the grass has grown and protect the design by wrapping it with cloth. To attach ribbon, cut along the edge forming a needle. Insert ribbon into the first hole; bring enough through to tie a large knot at the end.\nRepeat the process on the other side of the pot. Adjust ribbon as needed. On larger, heavier pots ribbon is only ornamental. If unsure about using the ribbon as a handle, carry the basket from the bottom.\nTo ensure your sweet treats stay that way, don't water the basket the day before you'll use it because the grass and soil will retain moisture. For added protection, wrap candy and food in cellophane bags.\nSeveral fruits, vegetables and spices can create natural dyes. There are two methods for dyeing eggs: boiling raw eggs with dye agent (hot) or dipping hard-boiled eggs in cold or room-temperature dye (cold). Each approach will yield different results.\nHot boiling method: To create dye, use 2 tablespoons of white vinegar per quart of water, add dye ingredients and bring to a boil. To remove ingredients, strain solution into bowl and return solution to pan. Place eggs in pot; add additional water to cover. Bring dye solution and raw eggs back to a full boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Leave in pot longer for darker colors. Use spoon to remove eggs from solution, rinse with lukewarm water and allow to dry. Alternatively, you can boil the ingredients and the raw eggs simultaneously. Hot-dyed eggs are purely decorative and should not be eaten.\nCold dipping method: Boil eggs and dye ingredients separately. Cool and strain dye into small bowls. Dip eggs for five, 10, 30 minutes or overnight. As with the hot method, the longer the eggs sit in the solution the more intense the colors. Remove eggs from solution with spoon and allow to dry.\nEggs that last: Hollow eggs allow you to keep them from one year to the next. To create hollow eggs, thoroughly clean them with hot soapy water. Carefully hold egg in hand or steady in an eggcup and use small paring knife or thumb tack to make two small holes on both ends of egg. Remove egg white and yolk by blowing egg over the kitchen sink. Rinse eggshell under hot water and soak in hot water for 15 minutes. Allow water to drain, before placing in dye solution. Be sure the egg fills with liquid so it is submerged during the dyeing.process. The natural dyes will fade overtime; keep the color by applying gloss acrylic spray varnish.\nBlue painters tape and removable stickers are perfect for creating smooth lines, as well as striped or polka dot patterns. Apply first coat of paint and allow to dry; next, place tape around pot and apply second coat of paint. Allow last coat of paint to dry and remove tape to reveal the previous layer of paint.\nCreate designs with rubber cement, it protects the area where you wish to keep specific colors. Apply cement to the area and allow to dry. Paint pot with next color. Allow second coat of paint to dry before removing the rubber cement. Do so by gently rubbing it with your fingers.\nDecorate with decoupage. Use decoupage glue to attach and seal cut outs and stickers to your pot. Or, use rubber stamps and stencils to embellish your pot.\nRed: Boil 4 cups chopped beets or for light pink boil a can of beets.\nBlue: Boil 1/2 head of chopped red cabbage to 2 quarts of water.\nLight violet: Boil 1 cup of blackberries.\nGreen: Boil 1 cup of fresh spearmint leaves. Or, boil 2 cups fresh rosemary leaves.\nYellow: Boil 2 tablespoons ground turmeric.\nOrange: Boil 3 cups of yellow onion skins.\nBrown to dark brown: Use 1 quart coffee, omit additional water."

In science the UK managed 21st place, the only discipline in which Britain is above average. In previous years, the UK has been ranked in the top 20 countries for at least one subject. The poor performance comes despite education spending in the UK being higher than the OECD average, with $98,023 (£59,715) spent on each child between the age of six and 15. The typical level for the industrial democracies in the group is $83,382.\nThe UK is also home to a startling gender gap: in science, male pupils outperform female pupils by 13 points, while the gap is only one point in favour of boys in the OECD generally.\nDespite the unimpressive result for the UK, countries like France, Ireland and New Zealand get broadly similar results. The top of the table is dominated by east Asian countries, with ranked highest in each discipline. Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan follow, with small numbers of low-achievers.\n“We need more practical education in technology at all levels, it is vital for everyone in nearly all careers to be tech-savvy,” he added."

        "text": "In mid-October 2008, even as the Reserve Bank was dousing the system with rupee and forex liquidity, Finance Minister (P) Chidambaram had suo moto constituted a committee on liquidity management, with Finance Secretary Arun Ramanathan as the chairman. The Reserve Bank was asked to nominate a representative on the committee. I was annoyed and upset by this decision. Chidambaram had clearly overstepped into the RBI turf as liquidity management is a quintessential central bank function. Not only did he not consult me, but he had not even informed me of this before the notification was issued. Coming as it did amidst a lot of suspicion in those early weeks of my tenure that I was a government lackey sent to the Reserve Bank to act at the government’s bidding, the constitution of this committee only reinforced the view.\nI called up Chidambaram and let him know in unequivocal terms that his action was totally inappropriate, and requested firmly that he dissolve the committee. His argument was that when liquidity management was such a central concern, getting advice from external market participants would help us understand and respond to the ground reality in the market faster and better. I granted that, but if he wanted external experience to be tapped, he could have advised me informally to constitute such a committee rather than taking the Reserve Bank for granted. The call ended with my telling him that the Reserve Bank would not participate in the committee. This skirmish with Chidambaram, who I believed pushed my candidature for the governor’s job, so early in my tenure upset me a lot. Little did I know that this set the tone for what would be an uneasy relationship between us in the last year of my term.\nThere was constant and decidedly unhelpful friction between the ministry of finance, under both Pranab Mukherjee and later Chidambaram, and the Reserve Bank on what the government saw as the Reserve Bank’s unduly hawkish stance on interest rates, totally unmindful of growth concerns. The distilled version of their argument went as follows. All the government’s efforts to kickstart the supply response in the economy were being stymied by the high-interest regime of the Reserve Bank. If only the Reserve Bank relaxed on the interest rate, investment would take off and launch the economy into a virtuous cycle of increasing growth and declining inflation.\nWhen Chidambaram was asked in a media interaction in July 2013 why he was frustrated with the Reserve Bank when all it was doing was pursuing its mandate of price stability, he admitted that the Reserve Bank’s mandate was indeed price stability but that ‘mandate must be understood as part of a larger mandate of promoting growth’. The clear implication was that the Reserve Bank was mistaken in interpreting its mandate.\nI believe both Pranab Mukherjee and Chidambaram had erred in seeing the Reserve Bank as being fixated on inflation, unmindful of growth concerns. On the contrary, the Reserve Bank interprets its mandate exactly as Chidambaram had said, although not as he implied. The Reserve Bank was targeting price stability precisely because it is a necessary condition for sustained growth….\nThe burden of my argument both in the public domain as well as internally to the government was that the Reserve Bank was running a tight monetary policy not because it did not care for growth but because it did care for growth. But the government remained unpersuaded or chose to be unpersuaded.\nIn order to defend his position vis-a-vis the Reserve Bank and possibly to sound a conciliatory note, in a media conference in July 2013, Chidambaram had generalized this divide between governments and central banks by saying that ‘governments are for growth and central banks are for price stability’. This stereotyping was misinformed not only with reference to India but even from a broader experience….\nAlthough the high-interest-rate regime would be the main area of difference between the government and the Reserve Bank, there were other issues that stoked the friction even deeper.\nOne such issue which was almost always a point of contention in my pre-policy meeting with the finance minister was the estimate for growth that the Reserve Bank would be putting out in its policy document. The government’s pet peeve was that the Reserve Bank was being too cynical in its forecasts. Either the secretary of economic affairs or the chief economic adviser (CEA) would contest our estimate with their assumptions and estimates which I thought were par for the course. What used to irritate me, though, was that almost seamlessly the discussion would move from objective arguments to subjective considerations, with one of the senior officers suggesting that the Reserve Bank must project a higher growth rate and a lower inflation rate in order to share responsibility with the government for ‘shoring up sentiment’. Finance Secretary Arvind Mayaram went to the extent of saying in one meeting that ‘whereas everywhere else in the world, governments and central banks are cooperating, here in India the Reserve Bank is being very recalcitrant’.\nI was invariably discomfited and annoyed by these objections and insinuations. I was also often dismayed that the ministry of finance would seek a higher estimate for growth while simultaneously arguing for a softer stance on interest rate without seeing the obvious inconsistency between these two demands. I used to take a consistent and firm position that the Reserve Bank cannot deviate from its best professional judgement just to doctor public sentiment….\nAnother constant source of friction used to be the position taken by the Reserve Bank on the government’s fiscal stance. The government’s large fiscal deficit was one of the prime drivers of inflation, and its inability to roll back expenditure undermined the Reserve Bank’s anti-inflation stance. There was no way the Reserve Bank could tell a credible inflation story without pointing this out. The finance ministry used to be irritated by the Reserve Bank making an issue out of its fiscal stance, and Pranab Mukherjee was always miffed about it; he clearly showed it even though he never said anything. But for me, skirting around this issue was neither appropriate nor advisable.\nIt was my standard practice to apprise the prime minister too of our statement on the government’s fiscal stance. He understood the economic logic but always seemed uncomfortable with the Reserve Bank pointing it out. He never intervened directly with me, but in early 2012, he told Rangarajan, the chairman of his Economic Advisory Council and my former boss when I was secretary to the council, to convey to me that he did not expect Subbarao, ‘who was finance secretary in the government and understood its political compulsions’ to take such a strident stand on the fiscal stance. I certainly had sympathy for this point of view but was unwilling and unable to show any accommodation….\nThere is a price to pay, of course, for not falling in line. The government has several ways of showing its displeasure, and the way it chose to do so with me was by going against my recommendations in the reappointment of deputy governors in the Bank.\nAs the head of the Reserve Bank, enjoined with a public responsibility, the governor should have the privilege of selecting his team just as the prime minister has the prerogative of choosing his Cabinet. There is no question, of course, that under law, it is the government that has the authority to appoint the governor and deputy governors of the Reserve Bank. There are rules about eligibility and tenure, which have to be complied with, and the system of selection has to be fair, transparent and contestable. Within that framework, a healthy convention should be to defer to the governor’s recommendation on the appointment of deputy governors. That privilege was denied to me.\nR Gopalan, called one evening to say that the finance minister had approved the constitution of a committee to select Usha’s successor. I was pained that even if the government had decided to deviate from the standard practice of consulting the governor on the reappointment of an incumbent, they had not even told me about it before constituting a selection committee. There was speculation that Pranab Mukherjee was irked by some regulatory decision taken on Usha’s watch which, of course, came on top of his general unhappiness with me.\nI sought a meeting with Pranab Mukherjee — incidentally one of only two occasions when I met him one-on-one — and requested that Usha be reappointed because of her competence, track record and because she met the eligibility criteria for reappointment. He knew that he could not call into question Usha’s competence or track record; it would have been presumptuous on his part to override my judgement on this issue with his own. He pleaded rules instead, but I was prepared for that point. I told him that the government had reappointed Shyamala Gopinath, another deputy governor, an identical case, under the same rule, and added for effect that he was the finance minister who had approved it. He didn’t budge and Usha became a part of the price we had to pay for asserting the autonomy of the Reserve Bank.\nWe had a replay of the same story in the case of reappointment of Subir Gokarn whose three-year tenure as deputy governor was expiring in December 2012. By this time, Chidambaram had returned as finance minister. As early as in August 2012, I requested Chidambaram to reappoint Subir for two more years and told him and that I would send a formal recommendation accordingly. I reiterated the request in October 2012. Chidambaram was clearly disinclined to accede.\nThe reason he gave was that all of us who entered the Reserve Bank laterally had become hostage to the technocrats in the Reserve Bank and the government felt it necessary to bring some fresh thinking into the Reserve Bank. He was firm that we should go through a de novo selection process.\nI reminded him that according to the rules framed by none other than him, Subir was eligible for reappointment; the question of opening up the position to other candidates would arise only if Subir was not recommended by the governor, which obviously was not the case. Chidambaram did not budge and insisted that we go through a process of selection. He agreed though that Subir could be considered by the selection committee along with other candidates.\nThe selection committee, under my chairmanship, went through the due process and agreed on a panel of three candidates, with Subir Gokarn at the top of the list. A couple of days later, P K Misra, secretary of the Department of Personnel, who was also a member of the selection committee, called me up to say that the minutes had to be redrafted since the rules did not allow for the committee to rank candidates in order of preference. I was surprised because he, as the ‘minder of rules’, had not said so when we met in the committee. I told him that I could not agree to the redrafting of the minutes through a bilateral, oral arrangement and that we should follow the due process. He should write to me explaining the rule position, then we should reconvene the committee to review the decision, and if agreed, dispense with the ranking. I did not hear from him again on this.\nSubir’s tenure was coming to an end on 31 December 2012. But even after Christmas, there was no news from the government. I was hoping that since his name was on top of the list, the finance minister would, even if reluctantly, acquiesce. We had a farewell function planned on 31 December to bid farewell to a couple of senior officers who were superannuating that day. My staff asked if we should cover Subir too under this farewell. I said ‘no’ in the hope that the reappointment would come through literally even at the eleventh hour. In the event, I underestimated Chidambaram’s desire to bring ‘fresh thinking’ into the Reserve Bank. Later that afternoon, we got the news that Subir’s appointment was not being renewed.\nAnother mischievous, if also clumsy, attempt by the government to assault the autonomy of the Reserve Bank came by way of appointing the directors on the central board of the Bank. As per law, it is the government’s prerogative to appoint the directors but the law also guarantees the directors so appointed a four-year term. In other words, the government cannot recall any director at will during the four-year tenure. Presumably, the intent behind this provision was to ensure that the directors acted independently without any threat of the government ‘showing its displeasure’ by terminating their appointment.\nPRANAB MUKHERJEE.WHO MOVED MY INTEREST RATE?\nPrev » Is Radhika Apte India's best actress?"

        "text": "German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble looks on as Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis speaks.\nGreece’s new SYRIZA government submitted its list of proposed economic reforms to the Eurogroup (the finance ministers of eurozone nations) on February 23 as a precondition for its international creditors to approve a four-month loan extension. The deal was signed on February 20.\nWith Greece’s existing loan arrangement expiring on February 28 and bankruptcy looming, a last-minute deal was finally agreed after three weeks of intense negotiations. The talks had been characterised by daily — sometimes hourly — twists and turns, claims and counterclaims, leaks and threats.\nSYRIZA was elected on January 25 on a wave of hope and rejection of the crippling austerity measures imposed on Greece in return for economic “bail-out” programs by the “Troika” — the European Central Bank (ECB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). The deal represents a significant compromise on its election platform.\nAny discussion of debt write-offs, “hair-cuts” or renegotiation has been postponed until the next round of negotiations. Funds earmarked for bank recapitalisation will have to be used for that purpose, rather than redirected towards meeting Greece’s desperate social needs.\nGreece no longer has to accept the unilateral diktats of the Troika and is able to negotiate with each body separately. But the new funding still comes with conditions. These include oversight by those same bodies, now referred to as “the institutions”, and restrictions on how the money can be used.\nThe SYRIZA government is required to refrain from any “rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions”.\nAlthough less than specific, this restriction includes any privatisations already completed, as well as those now underway. Depending on interpretation, this may also impact on measures promised by SYRIZA to improve social welfare, such as raising the minimum wage and restoring collective bargaining rights.\nOn the other hand, the agreement also includes measures that will improve SYRIZA’s ability to fund solutions to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Greece.\nTo gather funds, the government is able to crack down on corruption, tax avoidance, tax immunity (Greece’s powerful shipping owners, for instance, currently pay no tax) and smuggling.\nSuch measures target the vested interests of Greece’s powerful oligarchy — something previous governments deliberately avoided — and strengthen the revenue-raising capacity of the Greek state.\nThis approach has already achieved success, with a reported €500 million already raised. It still remains to be seen if enough revenue can be raised to address social needs while repaying Greece’s short-term debts — several billion euros are due for payment in the coming months.\nThe SYRIZA government has described the agreement as a qualified success. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis described it as “a small step in the right direction”.\nVaroufakis said that Greece is now the “co-author” of its own fate, no longer the victim of “autopilot austerity” where it meekly takes economic and policy directives from its creditors.\nIn a marathon 10-hour session on February 25, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras advocated the deal to his fellow SYRIZA MPs as a small but tangible win.\nAcknowledging the restrictive conditions in the interim agreement, Tsipras said that while it is an extension of pre-existing loan arrangements, it is not a continuation of the Memorandum of Understanding that accompanied the previous tranche of loans.\nTsipras said the new deal frees up the government from unrealistic primary surplus targets and “asphyxiating” policies of austerity. While “things remain difficult”, the prime minister said the conditions replace the previous government’s measures with targets based on SYRIZA’s “Thessaloniki program”, which it took into January’s election.\nSYRIZA’s leaders have faced severe internal criticism over the deal, however. It has mostly come from members of the party’s Left Platform, who consider the deal a near-capitulation to Greece’s creditors on the questions of debt and austerity. About 30 of SYRIZA’s 149 MPs, and four government ministers, belong to the Left Platform.\nA Left Platform leader and member of SYRIZA’s central committee, Stathis Kouvelakis, said SYRIZA had carried out a major retreat caused by a “mistaken strategy”. He said the deal showed it was impossible to break with austerity and Greece’s debt burden “within the existing European framework”.\nOn February 25, Greek energy minister and Left Platform supporter Panagiotis Lafazanis said the privatisation of Greece’s main energy company and energy grid operator would not go ahead, a statement that appears at odds with the deal’s conditions.\nThe SYRIZA government has emphasised that its promised social measures will go ahead. In a CNN interview on February 23, Varoufakis insisted “there will be no pension cuts, there will be no increases to Value-Added Tax, there will be a series of poverty-alleviation moves.\nVaroufakis conceded that Greece was forced into significant compromises, admitting on February 20 that he was asking Europe to meet Greece “not half-way, but one-fifth of the way”.\nIn the event, that was a lot more than powerful forces in Europe wanted to give them.\nSYRIZA was elected with a mandate to end austerity, resolve the country’s social crisis and rebuild the Greek economy. The humanitarian crisis caused by austerity has led to a widespread drop in living standards, with about one in four people unemployed (60% of youth) and an average 20% cut in wages for those in work.\nThe negotiation process, therefore, exposed the open contempt for democracy that lies at the heart of the European Union and the financial interests that it represents.\nSchäuble took this uncompromising stance into negotiations, using Germany's dominance within the Eurogroup to demand Greece’s total and unconditional capitulation.\nIf Greece was hoping for support from other countries suffering from austerity, however, it was disappointed. Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Finland — all facing rising political challenges to their pro-austerity governments — sided firmly with Germany, as did France and Italy, leaving Greece isolated.\nMeanwhile, Greece was faced with possible bankruptcy. A run on the banks led to an estimated €3 billion withdrawn in the week before February 20, on top of a further €12 billion withdrawn in January.\nIn the final days before the agreement, the ECB was preparing for a possible “Grexit” — a Greek exit from the eurozone, and therefore the EU.\nVaroufakis had already ruled out a voluntary Grexit on the basis of the economic damage it would cause and the boost it would give to the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, already the third largest party in the Greek parliament.\nA series of compromise drafts were rejected by Schäuble, who accused the Greeks of trying to present a “Trojan horse”. The claim was echoed in an increasingly nationalistic German media, which blames “lazy Greeks”, rather than a predatory and poorly regulated banking system, for the crisis.\nHowever, SYRIZA won exactly what Schäuble insisted so strenuously it would not get — a short-term loan extension, with a degree of control over spending to alleviate the worst elements of austerity.\nDifferences about the exact nature of the agreement appear to be emerging already.\nOn the one hand, the Greek government has presented the interim arrangement as a break from the Memorandum and its austerity policies.\nAfter the deal was struck, Schäuble exulted that “the Greeks certainly will have a difficult time explaining the deal to their voters”.\nFor its part, the IMF is concerned about the lack of “clear assurances that the [Greek] Government intends to undertake the reforms envisaged in the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies”.\nEven if the list of reforms is accepted by the Eurozone parliaments, the institutions have until the end of April to “refine” it. Key elements may yet be rejected."

        "text": "On Tuesday, Apple refreshed its MacBook Pro line, reconfiguring the laptops with the latest Core i5 and Core i7 processors based on its Haswell architecture, replacing previous chipsets with an Intel graphics processor dubbed \"Iris,\" and putting the new models on a modest diet.\nThe 13-in. MacBook Pro is 5% thinner and 3% lighter, for example.\nApple also reduced prices by $200, from $1,499 to $1,299 for the least expensive 13-in. laptop, and from $2,199 to $1,999 for the 15-in. model. Those cuts represented price decreases of 13% and 9%, respectively.\nSince the start of the year, Apple has slashed the price of the entry-level 13-in. Retina MacBook Pro by 24%.\nThe MacBook Pro was Apple's second notebook line this year to see price cuts. In June, Apple rolled out tweaked MacBook Airs at prices 7% to 8% lower than their predecessors.\nHistorically, the Cupertino, Calif., company has rarely lowered Mac prices, preferring instead to keep those stable but swap newer, faster processors for older CPUs, add more memory or increase storage.\nBut times are different, said Stephen Baker of the NPD Group.\n\"Apple's very high premium pricing is getting more difficult to sustain in this environment,\" said Baker, talking about the historic slump in the personal computer industry, now into its sixth straight quarter. \"They needed to bring the pricing more in line with the overall market.\"\nApple has been having a harder time selling Macs, just as has virtually every other computer maker. In the quarter that ended June 30, Apple sold 7% fewer Macs than it did during the same period the year prior, for instance.\nThe price cuts were also an admission by Apple that tablets continue to cannibalize sales of laptops, said Baker. \"Apple's portion of the $1,000-plus PC market is not quite as big as it used to be,\" he noted. \"They've had some cannibalization in their higher buckets.\"\nThat cannibalization has come from both tablets and lower-priced notebooks, including Apple's own MacBook Air line, said Baker. And also, in a small way, from touch-based Windows portables and the even more radical designs known as \"convertibles,\" \"hybrids\" or \"2-in-1s.\"\n\"In the past year, premium-priced Windows [devices] have seen pretty decent growth,\" said Baker. \"They're starting from very low volumes, but that's still growth.\"\nUnlike Windows OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), Apple has an advantage when it comes to tablet cannibalization: It can sell its own iPad and at least keep customers within its garden.\nApple has actually reveled in the trend. \"I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us,\" said CEO Tim Cook during a January 2013 conference call with Wall Street. \"One, our base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it, and so we never fear it. We know that iPad will cannibalize some Macs [so] that doesn't worry us.\"\nBaker thought that was smart.\n\"They get retail, and one of the key pieces of retail is that products get cannibalized,\" said Baker. \"But it's always better to cannibalize your own rather than let someone else do it, even if it costs [you] some margin.\"\nOn Tuesday, Cook reaffirmed Apple's stake in the personal computer market, perhaps responding to talk over the last several weeks that Apple might -- and in some analysts' minds, should -- mimic Microsoft and force the iPad into 2-in-1 duty as a light-weight laptop by adding a keyboard.\n\"Our competition is different. They're confused. They chased after netbooks. Now they're trying to make tablets into PCs, and PCs into tablets,\" Cook said at the rollout of the new iPads. \"[But] we have a very clear direction and a very ambitious goal. We still believe deeply in this category [of traditional notebooks] and we're not slowing down on our innovation.\"\nApple also dumped the 15-in. non-Retina MacBook Pro from its sales list on Tuesday, leaving only the 13-in. model as a not-with-Retina choice. That notebook relies on a 500GB platter-style hard disk drive rather than an SSD (solid-state drive) and is the last of Apple's laptops to include a built-in DVD drive. The 13-in. MacBook Pro starts at $1,199, now just $100 less than the bottom-end 13-in. Retina MacBook Pro."

        "text": "Russia’s recognition of “North Macedonia” disappointed many activists in what Moscow would have otherwise continued to regard as the Republic of Macedonia per its constitutionally legitimate name, but this purely political move shouldn’t have been all that unexpected in hindsight because it correlates with speculation that Moscow plans to take the lead in shaping the “New Balkans”.\nRussia surprised many observers in the Balkans when it recognized “North Macedonia” in spite of its previous principled opposition to the post-Color Revolution government’s blatantly illegal disregard of the population’s unequivocal refusal to support this move during last year’s referendum. Many activists in what Moscow would have otherwise continued to regard as the Republic of Macedonia per its constitutionally legitimate name are sorely disappointed by this purely political move and are struggling to understand why it happened, but the reason actually isn’t all that unexpected in hindsight. It needs to be recognized that while there were veritably very powerful soft power merits to Moscow continuing to inspire (key word) protests by refusing to recognize the so-called “compromise name” that Zaev agreed to impose on his people for the express purpose of expediting the country’s entry into the EU and NATO, the modern-day Russian Federation isn’t driven whatsoever by ideological motivations like its Soviet predecessor but is instead coldly pragmatic in pursuing its own interests.\nIn contrast to the way that he’s often portrayed by Alt-Media (and especially through misleadingly decontextualized memes and quotes spread by the “Putinist” cult), President Putin actually isn’t as anti-Western as many of his international supporters have been encouraged to believe. He’s indisputably a more sovereignty-focused leader than his predecessor and a much stronger one at that, but instead of being the “enemy” of the “New World Order” that a lot of people are under the mistaken impression that he is, President Putin assumed the role of a “balancer” between it and the emerging Multipolar World Order in order to enable Russia to decisively influence the balance of power between the American and Chinese superpowers in a game-changing way in pursuing his country’s interests at any given time. This flexible grand strategy explains why Russia is simultaneously advancing the construction of alternative multipolar global institutions like the BRICS Development Bank in parallel with seeking a “New Détente” with the West in order to receive sanctions relief.\nBy accepting this strategic backdrop in spite of the sadness that it might cause in the hearts of well-intended people the world over who placed their entire hopes in President Putin as a “hero” who they mistakenly thought put all of his effort into endlessly fighting against the “New World Order”, it’s much easier to understand Russia’s recognition of “North Macedonia” and the larger motivation behind this move. There’s no doubt that “The Macedonian Name Deal Threatens To Erase European Identity” and that “Macedonia’s About To Become The World’s First ‘Politically Correct’ Police State” because of it, but there realistically isn’t anything that Russia can do to prevent any of this from happening. In fact, when faced with seemingly “inevitable outcomes” such as “Israel’s” “Yinon Plan”, Russia actually has a track record of involving itself in these processes to one extent or another as it tries to guide events in the direction of its own interests, with this oftentimes – but not always – overlapping with most of its partners’.\nAs a case in point, the author reported on three important policymaking pieces by the highly influential Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) earlier this year to conclude that “Russia Might Return To The Balkans In A Big (But Controversial) Way”, namely by facilitating Timothy Less’ controversial plan to partition the Balkans along ethno-religious lines through a series of “peaceful” and “democratic” processes instead of the more violent ones that took place when creating the so-called “New Middle East”. This “New Balkans” might not be the ideal future that most of its inhabitants wanted but it could conceivably represent the best “compromise solution” between the many competing visions by all sides and possibly preempt an outbreak of hostilities that could horribly replicate the “New Middle East” in the worst-case scenario, or at least that seems to be how Russia is tacitly “rationalizing” its recognition of “North Macedonia” and possible support of Vucic’s speculated upcoming “compromise” on Kosovo too (the latter of which was elaborated in the above hyperlinked analysis).\nThere’s no doubt that Russia’s decision to recognize “North Macedonia” disappointed many in the country and beyond, but that’s largely because they had a mistaken view of President Putin and only saw in this “geopolitical Rorschach blot” whatever they wanted, which in this context mostly seemed to be a “knight in shining armor” who “dedicated his life” to “opposing” the “New World Order”. Professor Dugin was far ahead of his time in writing about President Putin’s liberal-conservative duality in his 2015 book “Putin vs Putin: Vladimir Putin Viewed from the Right”, which has in hindsight been vindicated by Russia’s visibly evolving approach towards the Balkans and its apparent decision to “co-opt” America’s strategic designs there in order to “guide” this seemingly “inevitable outcome” in the direction of its own interests. Removing Macedonia from the map (by backing its name change to “North Macedonia”) and eventually recognizing Kosovo are the two catalysts for building the “New Balkans”, though only time will tell if Russia did the right thing."

We have all had a situation where we were in a jam for cash real quick and needed to use the nearest ATM, even if it was not the one from the bank that we use. When those moments come, we always have to question if the fee we are about to encounter is worth the speed at which we are getting out money.\nNow, we might have an easier time deciding against getting the cash as ATM fees for using an ATM that is not under a bank that you use might be increasing to as much as five dollars per transaction in the near future.\nBanks like Chase are already looking into capping debit card transactions at as little as $50.\nNow Chase is also trying out a $5 ATM fee for people who use their ATM’s, but are not Chase customers. In Illinois, the high fee is being tested. In Texas, a slightly more moderate fee of four dollars is being tried out.\nIn addition to the growing ATM fee from the bank that operates the ATM, your bank always charges you for using your card on an ATM that does not belong to them. This fee is usually about three dollars. That means that to get a quick $20, it might cost you more than $8.\nBanks like Chase spend around $200 million per year to operate their nationwide system of ATM machines. For Chase, they run approximately 16,000 ATM’s.\nHSBC Bank USA has also increased their rates to $3 per transaction for all people who use their ATM’s, but are not customers.\nOther major banks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo have not decided whether or not to implement higher fees just yet.\nThe new ATM fees combined with the potential price caps on debit card transactions are making people look at the Wall Street reform differently.\nWhile the reform has overall improved the way corporate America is run and no longer allows banks to be overly liberal with their money, it is now changing the way Americans will have to bank.\nNow, we have to be more frugal about our debit purchases as we might not be able to spend more than $50 at a time. We also can’t just go up to any ATM and get out some quick cash without paying a higher fee.\nBut is this really bad? Or is it a blessing in disguise as we are now going to be forced to be smarter about our expenses?"

Danya Skolkin and Josh Tillis didn’t pause to consider the ratio of precipitation to luck when skies turned ominous in the days just before their wedding last fall.\nBut on Aug. 25, as Ms. Skolkin and Mr. Tillis were finalizing the details of their Sept. 3 wedding in downtown Houston, Hurricane Harvey made landfall, ripping into that city and reaching its peak just before the college sweethearts and their more than 300 guests were about to celebrate.\nAt first they crossed their fingers, hoping the wedding would go on. But with six days to go and meteorologists in slickers deployed across the city issuing warnings about the devastation to come, Ms. Skolkin and Mr. Tillis, both 28, made the decision to postpone.\nBut she knew that what others faced in Houston was far more grave. Hundreds of thousands of Texas and Louisiana residents were displaced because of flooding.\nSo, with nothing to do but read the fine print on vendors’ cancellation policies and watch Harvey’s waters continue to rise, inspiration struck. After the roads cleared, the couple went to Aishel House, a Jewish nonprofit organization that offers shelter and warm meals to Houston hospital patients and their families. “We didn’t even call, we just showed up, knowing they would be busy in this state of crisis,” Ms. Skolkin said.\nMs. Skolkin and Mr. Tillis had planned to host a dinner for about 100 out-of-town guests at Aishel House that day. Instead of feeding their guests, they fed a three-course meal to 100 displaced local residents.\nThat particular event space is a special one for Ms. Skolkin and her family. Holly Harwood Skolkin, Ms. Skolkin’s mother, was a founder of Aishel House. Ms. Harwood Skolkin was not able to see her daughter’s selflessness. In 2012, she died of breast cancer after a 15-year struggle with a stage 4 diagnosis.\nWithin minutes, they were deboning and breading chicken breasts by the dozens.\nRochel Lazaroff, a co-director of the house, said Aishel House had already pre-ordered enough chicken breasts, brisket, salads, salmon and desserts to cater the couple’s Shabbat welcome dinner for their long-distance wedding guests. The food, fortuitously, had arrived the week before.\n“It brought tears to our eyes,” Ms. Skolkin said after she and Mr. Tillis realized how their postponed wedding plans would able to help their community in need.\nJust three months after Ms. Harwood Skolkin died, Mr. Tillis’s father, Barry Tillis, died of lung cancer. Neither is sure they would have gotten engaged if their personal tragedies hadn’t overlapped.\nMr. Tillis got to know Ms. Harwood Skolkin before she died, and Ms. Skolkin got to know Barry Tillis. The elder Mr. Tillis was an emotional father who never missed a youth sports event and cried at every one. “People in our hometown still remember that about him,” Mr. Tillis said.\nThat includes her daughter. “We were so close,” she said. “We did all the stuff gals do, like shop and go out to eat. We were always laughing.” Ms. Harwood Skolkin inspired her daughter’s career as a nurse practitioner for heart failure patients; her mother’s gratitude toward the nurses who helped her through cancer steered her toward nursing.\nMr. Tillis fell for Ms. Skolkin’s good-heartedness and elegance. He also loves that she became, at his near insistence, a Denver Broncos football fan. By the time both graduated from the University of Texas and moved into a Houston high-rise together in 2015, they had established their own football tradition.\nMr. Tillis, a lifelong fan, is a demonstrative touchdown celebrator. “I jump up and do a dance, I yell at the TV, I express my emotions physically,” he said. “I can’t contain myself.” Ms. Skolkin has taken to capturing his joyous displays covertly on camera. She has amassed a band of Snapchat followers who look forward to watching Mr. Tillis’s outpourings of Broncos ebullience.\nOn Sept. 25, 2016, the day Mr. Tillis decided to propose, he made sure the Broncos were on.\n“She was sitting on the couch, just a normal Sunday, she’s got no makeup on and we’re just about to click on the TV,” Mr. Tillis recalled. “After the first big play I started running around the apartment like I usually do, and before she could grab her phone I went and grabbed a jersey I had bought her.” The jersey said Tillis on the back. Mr. Tillis got down on one knee and asked if she would be his wife. Ms. Skolkin accepted the ring she recognized as her mother’s — Dr. Skolkin had given it to Mr. Tillis in advance. She instantly accepted.\nOn Dec. 17, Ms. Skolkin walked down the aisle of the Marriott Houston ballroom, accompanied by her father. The bride wore a Martina Liana mermaid-style gown with pearl button detail up the back. Mr. Tillis, in a midnight blue tuxedo custom made in Thailand, met them beneath a stage set with a huppah. Rabbi Brian A. Strauss of Congregation Beth Yeshurun, and 340 guests, watched as Ms. Skolkin circled Mr. Tillis seven times, conveying unity and completeness, according to Jewish custom.\nAlthough Hurricane Harvey passed through Houston months ago, it was still fresh in the minds of attendees. Rabbi Strauss said his synagogue suffered about $6 million in damage from the storm. He took heart in learning he would be marrying a generous and kind couple.\nIn their vows, which the couple read to each other before the traditional breaking of the glass, both remembered their late parents.\n“You have shown me that even life’s hardest, most confusing times can result in the most beautiful clarity,” Ms. Skolkin said as two maids of honor, a best man, 10 bridesmaids, 11 groomsmen and five ushers stood by them.\nIn his vows, Mr. Tillis said his father used to pepper him with questions about what he was looking for in a woman, and he would give his answers: “Smart, funny, pretty, strong Jewish identity.” His father thought these were good qualities, but told the younger Mr. Tillis that most important in a partner is a good heart.\nHe saw just that when Ms. Skolkin fed, bathed and clothed her mother, and kept her spirits up. Ms. Harwood Skolkin, in the late stages of her illness, once grabbed Mr. Tillis by the arm and told him Ms. Skolkin was her “berakah” — Hebrew for blessing.\nCome rain or come shine, both knew how lucky they were — on their second planned wedding day — to have found each other.\nPaul DeBenedetto contributed reporting from Houston.\nHouston Serenade The reception, also at the Marriott, opened with a first dance to “Home” by Michael Bublé, then transitioned into a choreographed wedding party dance to Flo Rida’s “My House”; the music was a mix between a D.J. and an Austin wedding band, the Matchmaker Band.\nField and Flowers Both a bride’s and groom’s cake were served during the reception. For her cake, Ms. Skolkin chose a four-tier buttercream confection with fondant flowers and gold accents. Mr. Tillis’s cake was more reflective of his passion for the Denver Broncos. A double-chocolate cake made to look like a football field."

The complex is a few blocks away from Diridon Station and the SAP Center, where Google plans a massive, transit-oriented complex of offices, restaurants, shops, residences, open spaces and other amenities in a development where 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant’s employees would eventually work. It’s also across the street from the three-building Adobe Systems headquarters, which Adobe intends to expand with a fourth office tower.\nSJ Cityview, an affiliate of San Francisco-based developer Jay Paul, purchased the 580,000-square-foot complex, according to Santa Clara County property records that were filed July 23. The seller was Park Center Plaza Investors, an affiliate of realty investment firm Equus Capital Partners.\nThe Jay Paul affiliate paid $283.5 million in cash for the property, which is bounded by West San Fernando Street, South Almaden Boulevard, Park Avenue and South Market Street, county documents show. The complex consists of 534,000 square feet of offices and 46,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space.\n“The mixed-use Class A campus consists of high-rise and mid-rise office buildings, retail and restaurant space, united by a newly designed plaza area with outdoor seating, artwork and water features,” according to an Equus web page about Cityview Plaza.\nAlong with several large office buildings, Cityview Plaza contains 40,000 square feet of restaurant and retail spaces, including Specialty’s Cafe & Bakery, Morton’s Steakhouse, Scott’s Seafood, Peggy Sue’s, Bank of America, Heritage Bank and Wells Fargo Bank. In recent years, Equus launched a wide-ranging renovation that added a new fitness center, conference center, a fountain and upgraded landscaping, a property brochure stated.\nColliers International and Cushman & Wakefield, commercial realty brokerages marketing the complex, stated in a brochure that Cityview Plaza commands a top-notch site.\nThe property is perched near the Fairmont Hotel and the Paseo de San Antonio.\n“Cityview Plaza is centrally located in downtown San Jose” and features an “amenity-rich environment,” the brochure stated.\nThe Cityview Plaza deal, at $283.5 million, looks to be the biggest commercial real estate acquisition so far during 2018 in Santa Clara County, as indicated by a review of major property purchases in the South Bay reported by this news organization.\nIn January, a 64,000-square-foot Palo Alto office building occupied by Visa was bought for $138 million, notable for its head-spinning price of $2,165 a square foot. In March, a big office building in Mountain View that’s leased to Google, along with adjacent land suitable for development, was bought for $169.9 million.\nSteven Golubchik, Edmund Najera and David Hosler, executives with realty brokerage NKF Capital Markets, arranged the purchase of Cityview Plaza.\n“With one of the largest Caltrain stations and a BART line under development, downtown San Jose will be one of the most easily accessible and interconnected locations in Northern California, making this a strategic investment,” said Golubchik, a vice chairman with NKF Capital Markets."

Published on September 29, 2015.\nThe current programmatic space is wrought with challenges, but programmatic 3.0, as an Advertising Week panel coined it, pales in comparison to the challenges of programmatic 2.0.\nProgrammatic 1.0 arose from a need to sell remnant inventory, explained Shenan Reed, president of digital for WPP's MEC in North America. \"There was better ROI for us [in 2.0], but it led to a lot of pushing down on price and dilution of quality,\" she said. \"[Programmatic] 1.0 had better quality, but 2.0 was wrought with challenges. 3.0 is our turn to say we want to make it work harder for us.\"\nIn the early days of programmatic, when publishers were trying to sell extra inventory, sell rates were only 10% to 30%, she said. \"The challenge was in creating revenue that was meaningful. They ultimately sold off too much inventory at too low a price.\"\nToday, it's about getting back to quality inventory that reaches the right people with the right messaging, agreed panelists.\n\"There was a time we had to sacrifice scale for quality. Now big publishers like me don't need to do that anymore,\" said Jeremy Randol, VP of programmatic sales strategy at Pandora. \"2016 will be the year of programmatic mobile. We've seen companies make strides in defining cross-device [metrics]. DSPs are doing a better job. And there's a migration toward more quality connections.\"\nHe said Pandora one and a half years ago hired people who could make programmatic a mainstream sales tactic. His team has grown to 10 people.\nMs. Reed asked the group if in the next version of the marketplace advertisers will be able to buy against a cost-per-acquisition metric. Currently, most buying happens on a CPM, or cost-per-thousand-impression metric.\n\"We'll sell against how effective the advertising is,\" said Mark Zagorski, CEO of Nielsen's Exelate. \"We're moving into a world where everything is sold on a CPA basis.\"\n\"We'll get to a place where sellers can make some real money again,\" added Ms. Reed. \"We've been pushing media partners down and down on these CPMs because we don't see it working.

What?!\nAccording to what a friend of the Teen Mom 2 mama told Hollywood Life, Chris isn't there for the baby like Kailyn thought he'd be after he showed up to the hospital to be there when the baby was born.... and it's really not looking good for the future.\n\"Kail's relationship with Chris has been like a rollercoaster -- full of ups and downs and unexpected turns. After he showed up for the delivery and drove them home from the hospital, Kailyn thought there was going to be a good chance he would actually be in his son's life. He even made the effort to visit a few times, with gifts for the baby. But just as Kailyn started believing that Chris may actually be committed to being a dad, he bails.\"\nOh no! That sounds like a miserable thing to deal with when you're juggling life with a newborn (and two kids!) as a single mom.\nWe're not convinced this story is true, though. Just recently, Chris was on Twitter, talking about how much he loves hanging out with his son, so if he's not lying, we'd take that to mean that he has no plans of bailing -- and hasn't so far.\n\"It's one thing if he dips in and out of her life, but it's not OK to do that to a child. Right now, she's one step away from cutting Chris out of her life completely, as she can't help but think having no father is better than having one who constantly upsets, hurts, and bails on his child.\"\nWe hope everything works out for these two.... for Baby Lo's sake, anyway."

        "text": "Many of these Christmas traditions are universal, but most of our rituals are made unique thanks to a specific family spin. Here are the traditions that I wouldn’t want to miss – and how my friends and family enjoy them in their own special ways.\nWhen it comes to opening presents, being patient on the big day is always a challenge, whether you’re two or, ahem, 32. Some people are mature and disciplined enough to wait until after the Queen’s speech.\nHowever, for others, tradition dictates that the exchange of gifts happens on Christmas Eve. This isn’t necessarily down to impatience, it’s a big cultural tradition across Europe.\nIn France, festivities usually begin with an elaborate, multi-course dinner on Christmas eve, called “le réveillon de Noël” – and presents typically follow. Some people follow this tradition for different reasons.\nMost regular churchgoers wouldn’t dream of celebrating the season without attending midnight Mass. Even if your approach to festivities is typically more secular, a late night church visit can be a way of starting a busy, boozy 72 hours in a peaceful, contemplative setting.\nOK, it’s peaceful and contemplative until the pubs close, and you have the chance to hear tipsy churchgoers turn up late and then really go for it and try to do the descant of O Come All Ye Faithful. My family are faithful midnight Mass attendees, and equally committed to staying sober for the duration of the service.\nHowever, tradition dictates that as soon as we get home afterwards, we get stuck into the red wine and hot sausage rolls.\nMany people dread Secret Santa, the tradition of buying an anonymous gift for a selected participant, usually for under a fiver.\nOften the ritual involves forgetting about it until the 22nd, getting an email that reminds you that you’re supposed to be swapping presents over lunch, and hyperventilating at the till of your nearest stationery shop wondering whether Nigel from accounts really wants a photo frame decorated with pineapples.\nHowever, my five sisters and I have made Secret Santa a family tradition – and we each buy one gift for one sister, instead of presenting each other with a series of pineapple photo frames.\nSecret Santa comes with its own micro traditions, like trying to coordinate the draw using an app, syncing it with Facebook, and accidentally inviting old colleagues and ex boyfriends to exchange gifts, before giving up and doing it with bits of paper.\nA full stocking simply isn’t enough to prove that your house has been visited by Father Christmas – savvy Santa fans like to see a smeary, empty sherry glass, a few mince pie crumbs, or at least a discarded, nibbled carrot top, abandoned by Rudolph.\nSome parents report that since they’ve had children, Santa has started leaving sparkly footprints between the fireplace and the tree. In addition to the standard schooner and pie, I used to leave Santa a chocolate tree decoration, and courteous Santa would always thank me for it in his handwritten letter.\nNow I think about it, it’s amazing that Santa could visit the houses of every single boy and girl in the world and have time to leave a note. That’s a man who knows how to work to a deadline.\nThe spherical, white iced, berry embellished Christmas pudding is such an iconic festive symbol that it’s hard to believe that there isn’t a Christmas pudding emoji.\nAny tradition that involves setting food on fire is a thrilling one – whether your pudding has been boiled and steamed after months of preparation, or whether, like my family, you concentrate all of your anticipating energies into the five minutes that it spends in the microwave.\nThe True Grace Vetiver candle is the epitome of gorgeous, woody, wintry warmth."

The big picture: 3D printing enables virtual spare parts inventories.\n3D printing a replacement part It's surprisingly easy to create and print replacement parts. In this hands on, David Gewirtz shows how he created a fan cover replacement. The big picture: 3D printing enables virtual spare parts inventories.\n3D printing is often touted as a great tool for designers to test and refine their designs prior to manufacturing. But you can do a lot more with 3D printing, even with inexpensive home printers. For example, you can use a 3D printer to create and produce a replacement part for something you use every day. In my case, I made a replacement back cover for a remote control.\nI have a desk fan I use all the time, the Vornado Flippi V Compact Air Circulator. It lives a few feet away from me, under my desk. It's small, powerful, and quiet. What makes it particularly useful is a remote control I can use to adjust the speed and oscillation, without ever moving away from my keyboard. This is great because I can turn it on and off when on the phone, or just tap the remote control when I'm too busy or lazy to move the five feet from my chair to the fan.\nThe problem is that I drop the remote all the time, and the back cover for the battery compartment tends to fly off and get lost. It really interrupts workflow to have to crawl around under my desk to look for the tiny part.\nNow, don't get mired in the details of this particular project. Instead, keep in mind the idea of making any replacement part. Obviously, whatever you need to make will be different from what I worked on. The key point is that a 3D printer can be a great resource for useful projects like crafting replacement parts for objects you use. Lots of people lose a part or two from a beloved object.\nAfter dropping the remote for probably the 20th time, and not being able to locate the cover to the battery compartment after a long search, I decided enough was enough.\nHas anyone seen my missing cover?\nIt's probably still somewhere down there, under my desk, unless the elves have taken it. I decided to make a new one.\nI'm fortunate, because I have a number of 3D printers in the shop to choose from. If I weren't writing about 3D printing, I'd probably only have one. For this project, I chose to use the most inexpensive of them, the $399 New Matter MOD-t. The MOD-t isn't as fast as the LulzBot or the MakerBot, nor does it create objects of super high quality, but it's a fine little printer.\nI was curious about whether I could use it for this purpose. The cover is quite small, making it possible to do a lot of print attempts. Each print only took about 20 minutes. Because I spent just a few minutes each time refining the design, the print time for each \"draft\" didn't bother me at all.\nThe key to the design was exploring and understanding the geometry of the cover. That may sound difficult, but all it really takes is observation, measuring, a little creativity, and the willingness to test.\nThe basic shape is that of a rectangle with a half-circle at the end. So I created a rectangle and circle in 123D Design and placed the circle over the rectangle. I then shrunk the thickness to 1.5 millimeters.\nTo get the width and length of the cover space, I used a pair of $29.95 digital calipers I picked up from Harbor Freight. Calipers are key, because they allow you to measure the distances for elements you need to make. You can usually get measurements down to a tenth of a millimeter, which is pretty precise. Of course, my measurements were always off by a bit, so once I designed the object based on my measurements, I had to print it, and then tweak the print to get things to fit.\nFirst, I printed the basic shape, the rectangle and circle.\nYou can see how this is made up of two simple shapes: a rectangle and a circle.\nThen I added a tab, so that it would fit in the slot in the remote. This took a few tries, because I had to get the right size, but also get the raised part to fit just so. It also wasn't hard. It just took the patience to tinker with it.\nInsert Tab A into Slot B.\nNext, I added the back hook. If you look at the image below, you can see the slot on the remote control body, and the hook I created. That, too, took a few iterations until I got it to fit right.\nThis is made with just two small rectangles at right angles.\nNext, I added the back tail of the cover, again with some level of iteration.\nThis becomes the outside of the cover.\nFinally, it all fit and closed over the remote. The only problem was, it didn't work. This was when I was reasonably convinced this whole project was a very bad idea. But it's also here that persistence was important.\nI spent some time examining the remote. I tested the battery with the remote and no cover, and found that by holding the battery just so, it would fire the remote. This meant that the cover replacement I was making would not require any wiring to complete a circuit. It also told me that the changes I needed to make were really about how to hold the battery in the right place.\nI added a flat circle spacer to push the battery down, and I also added another backing bar which pushed the battery forward into its contacts. This, as it turns out, was the winning design.\nHere's the final design view.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't completely reliable. It did work, but not regularly. All that took was a few more iterations, eventually moving the back bar back just a tiny bit so the pressure was just right. Then it worked.\nHere's the final piece. As you can see, it's not much larger than a penny.\nHere's the final part. It's not much bigger than a penny.\nI learned quite a few lessons in building this part, some of which may be valuable to you. First, let me reinforce that before I started learning about 3D printing about a year ago, I did not do mechanical constructions of any type. Yes, I have an engineering degree, but it's in computer science. I can design a circuit board. I can design a computer language and an operating system.\nBut fixing a bathroom sink? That's beyond my skill set. Creating a tiny replacement part for a fan? Before this year, you might as well have asked me to build a rocket in my backyard to travel to Mars. Not in my wheelhouse.\nNow, however, I've learned that the process of creating objects like this is really a matter of observation, measurement, and patience, as I mentioned above. Once I mastered the basic skills of 123D Design (which, quite honestly, isn't much harder than PowerPoint or any other drawing program), I was on my way. If you can draw a rectangle, you can do basic 3D design.\nI also learned that an inexpensive 3D printer can get the job done. It's not quite as clean an object as might be produced with a much more expensive printer, but it's good enough to do the job. I cleaned off some of the plastic detritus with a file and a pair of clippers. It works, which is all I really needed.\nFinally, I learned that it's easy to do this over about two weeks time. In actual elapsed time, this project probably took me about four hands-on hours (not counting waiting for the printer). If I had to spend a weekend doing nothing by designing, printing, trying, tweaking, and doing it all over again, I would have gone completely around the bend. But because I put in just a few minutes when I felt like it, the project proceeded easily. It really was quite fun to do.\nIn addition to actually having my remote working again, there's a very interesting benefit to 3D printing a replacement part. I now have a virtual inventory. The 3D design model is now on my file server. If I lose the cover again (and I most certainly will), I can just load the file on my printer and reprint.\nAs we move forward into more 3D printing use, I predict we're going to find that virtual inventories become one of the bigger benefits of 3D printing across the board.\nYou can download this replacement fan remote cover from Thingiverse.\nIs there a part you need a replacement for? Let me know what you think you might build in the TalkBacks below."

Pleasant, horticulture, who has served two terms as director of AIP. AIP’s current location includes a conference room, rooms for undergraduate and graduate student use and offices for the program’s staff and faculty.\nCo-chair of NASAC Jake Swamp ’11 said the proximity of the Kennedy Hall offices to Call Auditorium and the Trillium dining facility would jeopardize the quiet and relaxed atmosphere of the AIP center in Caldwell.\n“This [move] would serve to both split up the students, faculty and staff who constantly run into each other and form a cohesive community,” Swamp said.\nThe Caldwell center serves as an academic and community hub for students involved in AIP, Cheyfitz said.\nAlumni and current students echo Cheyfitz’s description of a strong Native American community in AIP.\nSpeaking on the issue of safe spaces for marginalized communities on campus, Cheyfitz discussed the importance of the Africana Center, the Asian American Studies Program and the Latino Studies Program. The latter two share a space on the fourth floor of Rockefeller Hall.\n“It’s important for all the ethnic studies programs to have contained space where students can get away from stresses of the day,” Cheyfitz said.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said students and faculty first received notification of the proposed move on Tuesday. In fact, members of the AIP community were notified of the proposal on Feb. 1. The Sun regrets this error."

        "text": "MONTREAL—Over the summer with the kids away, construction crews have hastily been erecting temporary, metal-clad extensions to aging school buildings across Montreal, to help cope with ever-increasing enrolment.\nA mini baby boom in the 2000s, increased immigration and a recent influx of refugees are putting enormous pressure on the education system in the city amid recent budget cuts and rapidly deteriorating school infrastructure.\nMontreal’s public schools are bursting at the seams and, similarly to the highways and bridges across the province, the bill for decades of neglect has come due.\nAs the first week of the Quebec election campaign comes to end and as thousands of children return to school, teachers and their unions want the four main political parties to make a pledge: reinvest massively in education instead of dogmatically striving to balance the budget.\nAt Saint-Gabriel-Lalemant elementary school in Montreal’s north end, the red, orange and grey-painted extension protrudes from the original building’s backside, swallowing part of the paved schoolyard.\nMarie-Jose Mastromonaco, a school board commissioner and its vice-president, said many of her board’s 150 schools had been expanding internally over the years, turning less frequently used spaces such as libraries into classrooms.\n“We got to a point where we transformed everything that was transformable,” she said in an interview, sitting inside one of the new classrooms in the extension.\nMost immigrants and refugees don’t qualify for the right to attend English school under Quebec’s strict language legislation and by law must enter the French system.\nWhile many English schools have empty classrooms and plenty of space for new children, French-language schools are being retrofitted with these one-floor, temporary extensions to handle all the kids.\nThe so-called modular classrooms are impressive: they’re well-lit, air-conditioned, with new desks and a giant digital screen at the front of the room.\nFor the 2018-19 school year, Mastromonaco’s board built 104 modular classrooms at 19 Montreal-area schools that will house roughly 1,800 students beginning Monday.\nThe extensions took roughly seven months to build from conception to delivery and cost about $20 million, she said.\n“These are temporary,” she insisted, while her board waits for the money for a real extension — or a new building.\nBut she doesn’t know how long, “temporary’’ means.\n“We hope (students) are here for five to 10 years — maximum,” she said.\nWhile the modular classes look like any new classroom, they mask a serious problem: roughly 75 per cent of all primary school buildings in the province are in bad or very bad shape, according to a recent government evaluation.\nAdditionally, the government noted 47 per cent of high schools were also in serious need of repair. The same report, the 2017-27 infrastructure plan, indicated that maintenance budgets for each school are running a collective deficit of $1.8 billion — not including the junior college or university system.\nIt’s not just the physical structures that are in bad shape, either.\nTeachers are burning out, according to their unions, and the Liberals’ drive to balance the books between 2014 and 2016 had a serious effect on morale.\nIRIS, an independent research institute in Montreal, estimated the Liberals’ so-called austerity initiatives resulted in cuts to school budgets totalling roughly $675 million — $337 million in the elementary and high school system alone.\nFollowing the lean years in spending, the Liberals used budget surpluses to inject money back into the education sector. The 2018-19 budget planned for a five per cent increase in the education budget over the previous fiscal year, followed by a 3.8 per cent increase for 2019-20.\nWhile none of the parties has yet released their costed financial plans regarding education, François Legault’s Coalition Avenir Quebec is promising to make school available for children at four years old and to “modernize” all school infrastructure.\nJacques Letourneau, president of the Confederation des syndicats nationaux, a major labour federation that represents teachers, said the new government must decide what its priority will be: deficit reduction or investment in schools.\nAs of March 2018, Quebec’s gross debt stood at $204.5 billion, representing 49.6 per cent of GDP, down from the peak of 54.3 per cent in 2014-15.\nBack at Saint-Gabriel-Lalemant, Mastromonaco said her schools couldn’t renovate at the pace they want even if they had the cash and the political will.\nSchools, she said, are suffering from another reality felt across the province: labour shortages due to a strong economy.\nMastromonaco said construction companies have so much work to do that some school-renovation contracts offered by her board haven’t attracted a single tender."

This time, the Lakers never had a chance.\nBogdanovic barely needed two minutes to reach double figures as he staked the Pacers to a 10-2 lead, a deficit from which Los Angeles never recovered.\nAfter the Lakers closed to 12-8, Indiana scored five straight, extended the lead to 28-21 and used a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Edmond Sumner to make it 33-26 after one quarter. Aaron Holiday’s 3 early in the second quarter gave Indiana a 42-28 lead. And when Los Angeles finally cut the deficit to 44-34, the Pacers answered with a 14-4 run.\nThey led 69-43 at the half, extended the lead to 83-53 on Tyreke Evans’ 3 with 7:31 left in the third quarter and the Lakers never got closer than 25 again.\nLakers: Played without Lonzo Ball (sprained left ankle) and Josh Hart (left patella tendinitis). … James certainly was not at his usual level. He missed three of his first five shots, was beaten on defense three times in the opening minutes and had five turnovers in the first half. James did become the fifth player in league history to top the 32,000-point mark. … Los Angeles has lost six straight in Indy, where it last won in March 2013. … Lance Stephenson had 13 points while Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram each had 12.\nPacers: In addition to playing without All-Star guard Victor Oladipo, Doug McDermott sat out with bruised ribs. Turner started despite a sore knee. … Indiana set new season-highs with 69 points in the first half and their final total. … The Pacers avoided their first season sweep by the Lakers since 2009-10. … Coach Nate McMillan tied Jack McKinney for No. 7 on the franchise’s NBA victories list with 125. … Indiana improved to 10-1 this season when seven or more players score in double figures. Domantas Sabonis, Aaron Holiday and Edmond Sumer each had 17 points. Cory Joseph finished with 13. … The Pacers have won four games this season by 30 or more points, matching their highest single-season total since 1993-94.\nLakers: Visit Boston on Thursday night in the fourth stop on a six-game trip.\nPacers: Host the Clippers on Thursday night."

As of early morning on Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin went down to around $500 across major exchanges, its lowest in nearly a month.\nTwo weeks ago, China's central bank said Bitcoin was not a currency and thus prohibited local financial institutions from processing bitcoin transaction. Now, the central bank has banned third-party payment companies from dealing in bitcoins, as reported by multiple news outlets.\nAs a result of these regulations, which put into question the viability of Bitcoin as a currency in China, the global price of Bitcoin has dipped to less than $500, after it hit $1,000 just three weeks ago.\nThe chart below, from Blockchain.info, shows the plunge in Bitcoin price as a result of China's clampdown.\nOn Tuesday, the People's Bank of China asked 10 of the largest Chinese third-party payment companies, which account for half of all online transactions in China, to stop dealing in Bitcoin, according to local news reports, a move that will effectively block new deposits of bitcoin into local exchanges.\nBTC China, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, confirmed on Wednesday with a post on its official Sina Weibo account that it would no longer accept deposits in the Chinese currency yuan, as a result of the latest ban.\n\"For reasons we all know, BTC China has had to cease renminbi [yuan] account charging functions,\" BTC China announced, according to The New York Times.\nBTC China's co-founder Bobby Lee later confirmed the news to the Financial Times. \"As of right now, we have received notice from our third-party payment company that they will disallow customers from making deposits into our exchange,\" he said.\nThe announcement sent the price of Bitcoin down $200 in less than 24 hours, as Techinasia reported.\nWith financial institutions banned from processing bitcoin transactions and with this new ban on bitcoin deposits through third party vendors, it is now virtually impossible for Chinese Bitcoin users to buy new bitcoins.\nThe price of Bitcoin skyrocketed last month in large part due to Chinese users flocking to buy the cryptocurrency and jumping on its global bandwagon. These latest bad news might cause Bitcoin prices to keep dipping, making Cameron Winklevoss' prediction that Bitcoin might hit $40,000 even more unlikely to ever come true."

        "text": "JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. -- Staff Sgt. Robert Bales made a mid-massacre confession, asked for help bleaching his blood-stained clothing and deliberately destroyed his laptop computer, fellow soldiers have testified -- statements that prosecutors say show he knew what he was doing the night 16 civilians were slaughtered in two villages in southern Afghanistan.\nThe remarks, offered by soldiers testifying for the government Monday and Tuesday, could pose a high hurdle for defense lawyers who have indicated that Bales' mental health will be a big part of their case. Testimony continues with several more witnesses Wednesday in a preliminary hearing that is being held to help determine whether the case goes to a court-martial.\nBales, a 39-year-old father of two from Lake Tapps, Wash., faces 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder in the March 11 attack on the villages of Balandi and Alkozai, which counted nine children among its victims.\nOne of the worst atrocities of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the attack prompted the U.S. to halt combat operations for days in the face of protests, and military investigators couldn't reach the crime scenes for a month.\nA prosecutor, Lt. Col. Jay Morse, said Bales spent the evening before the massacre at his remote outpost of Camp Belambay with two other soldiers, watching a movie about revenge killings, sharing contraband whiskey from a plastic bottle and discussing an attack that cost one of their comrades his leg.\nWithin hours, a cape-wearing Bales slipped away from the post and embarked on a killing spree of his own, said the prosecutor, Lt. Col. Jay Morse. He attacked one village then returned to Belambay, where he woke up a colleague and reported what he'd done, Morse said. The colleague testified that he didn't believe Bales and went back to sleep.\nBales headed out again, Morse said, and attacked the second village before returning once again in the predawn darkness, bloody and incredulous that his comrades ordered him to surrender his weapons.\nA medic, Sgt. 1st Class James Stillwell, said Tuesday he saw Bales covered in blood and knew from the pattern of the staining it wasn't his own. He asked where it came from and where he'd been.\nThe statement was one of many attributed to Bales that suggest he knew what he was doing, prosecutors say.\nSoldiers testified that after being taken into custody, Bales told them, \"I thought I was doing the right thing.\"\nAnd Stillwell said Bales told him that the soldiers at Camp Belambay would appreciate his actions once the fighting season ramped up: \"You guys are going to thank me come June.\"\nAt another point, Bales remarked, \"I guess four was too many\" -- an apparent reference to the number of family compounds in the attacked villages, Morse said Monday.\nBales was largely calm and compliant when he turned himself in following the massacre, several soldiers testified Tuesday. He followed orders and sometimes sat with his head in his hands, as though the magnitude of what he had done was sinking in, one said.\nAt one point, Bales made a joke -- pointing his finger, in the shape of a gun, at two soldiers guarding him -- in what they took as a failed effort to ease the tension.\nBut Bales also deliberately mangled his laptop, said two soldiers assigned to guard him as he gathered his things.\nOne of them, Sgt. Ross O'Rourke, testified that he removed the laptop from Bales' rucksack after the defendant told him he didn't want to take it with him. O'Rourke said Bales then grabbed the computer and folded the screen back, breaking it.\nThat didn't damage the hard drive, O'Rourke said, and investigators still could have retrieved information from the computer. O'Rourke didn't testify about what information might have been uncovered.\nOn Monday, Cpl. David Godwin testified that Bales asked him to bleach his blood-soaked clothes.\nTwo other soldiers, Pfcs. Derek Guinn and Damian Blodgett, testified Tuesday that they were on a guard shift early March 11 when they heard scattered gunfire coming from Alkozai, the first village attacked. They used thermal imaging and then shot up flares to illuminate the area, but couldn't make out what was going on.\nBlodgett said he reported it to the operations center on base, and a specialist told them to monitor it and let him know if it came toward them.\nThe shooting lasted for 30 to 40 minutes, Blodgett said.\nGuinn said he considered Bales to be bipolar: \"Sometimes he was in a really good mood, and he seemed really angry sometimes, or easily annoyed.\"\nTwo other witnesses said that later, an interpreter arrived with two Afghan National Army soldiers who reported that they had seen an American come and go from the base. Guinn gave a slightly different account when he recalled that the interpreter said the soldiers had seen two Americans arrive on base, and one head back out.\nAfter the shootings, some Afghan villagers questioned whether they could have been carried out by one soldier.\nBales has not entered a plea, and is not expected to testify. His attorneys, who did not give an opening statement, have not discussed the evidence, but say Bales has post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered a concussive head injury during a prior deployment to Iraq.\nBales has not participated in a medical evaluation known as a \"sanity board,\" because his lawyers have objected to having him meet with Army doctors outside their presence.\nBales' lawyers called their first witness Tuesday, a soldier who bagged the blood-soaked clothes Bales had been wearing as evidence. The testimony focused primarily on how the evidence was handled."

Directed once again by writer and executive producer Dean DeBlois, “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World” follows viking clan leader Hiccup as he tries to discover a hidden dragon utopia before the evil dragon hunter Grimmel finds him first.\nOn the carpet, DeBlois reflected on the “bittersweet” nature of the premiere – a fitting end for the more than ten years of work he’s put into the franchise.\n“How to Train Your Dragon” star Jay Baruchel was similarly sad to say goodbye to his character Hiccup – he’s been playing the role for 12 years now – although he says the full force of nostalgia has yet to hit him. On account of the film’s hectic work schedule, he says his final day of recording was “terribly uneventful,” especially since he didn’t realize it was his last.\nJoining Baruchel on the carpet was Gerard Butler who, despite his character’s death in “How to Train Your Dragon 2,” was excited to see the new film. As Hiccup’s father, he appears in several flashbacks, which he jokes only came about after he blackmailed DeBlois.\nFollowing the premiere, stars and guests alike celebrated the film at a “How to Train Your Dragon” themed block party, complete with Hiccup and Astrid impersonators, a candy bag station and Diddy Riese ice cream sandwiches.\n“How to Train Your Dragon: Hidden World” hits theaters Feb. 22."

        "text": "If Venus were a melody, it would not be a lyrical flute line followed by violin and cello solos. Gustav Holst got it wrong when he composed his famous suite, The Planets.\nVenus is anything but lovely. It's more like a furnace with sulfur clouds and crushing atmospheric pressure.\nAnd Graf can't have rookie astronomical mistakes if he is to conduct The Planets in NASA's hometown. So the Houston Symphony decided to fix the problem. Or at least turn the problem into art.\nWith the help of filmmaker Duncan Copp and state-of-the-art space images, the Houston Symphony has created The Planets — An HD Odyssey. The production is a musical and visual performance piece that features a high-definition movie of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and the other movements of Holst's suite.\nThe new movie debuts Thursday in Jones Hall in a live Houston Symphony concert of the work. Performances continue next weekend before the orchestra takes its new production to Florida and New York City's Carnegie Hall.\nThe new movie was commissioned by the Houston Symphony and created by Copp, the London-based producer of the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, which told the story of the Apollo astronauts.\nIn addition to the live performances, the Houston Symphony created a DVD of the movie and music for sofa-side viewing. Graf also expects the movie to be used by other symphonies in live performances.\nThough recognized as a powerful combination, pictures in the concert hall have been met with enthusiasm and criticism.\nIt's not new in Houston.\nSince 2005, the Houston Symphony has hung big screens in Jones Hall for some of its performances, projecting closeups of musicians just like on television. Graf conducted Richard Strauss' Alpine Symphony in 2008 set against images of a hike in the Alps. Recently, piano superstar Leif Ove Andsnes launched a project combining new visual works set to Mussorgksy's Pictures at an Exhibition that he performed in Houston and other cities.\nThough many found Andsnes' project riveting and a sign of classical music's visual future, critics complained that the images distracted from the beauty of the music and the pianist's performance.\nAdding images to musical performance is not for all occasions, Graf said. Bach or Beethoven might be better left unadorned, he said.\nIn a world increasingly glued to television, computer, movie and phone screens, it makes sense for the Houston Symphony to present a program such as The Planets — An HD Odyssey, said Dave Kirk, Houston Symphony principal tuba player.\nThe project, Kirk said, also has ignited interest in the Houston community. Ticket sales prove him right. The Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon shows were sold out more than a week before the performances. One of the last times the 2,100 seats were filled was for a concert of music including Star Wars.\n“Anything that increases people's awareness of what we do as an orchestra helps us artistically,” said Kirk.\nThe Planets lends itself to the project. It is one of the war horses of orchestra repertoire and a “gateway” to classical music for many a listener,” Kirk said.\nHolst's broad and dramatic melodies are played by a huge orchestra, fortified by extra woodwinds, brass and a chorus that commands attention. Even though the Mars movement is difficult rhythmically, many a marching band has taken it onto the field. The suite is often paired with images from space.\nWhen Holst wrote the piece in 1914, he was not describing the planets musically, but the gods of their names. Mars he called “the Bringer of War” and Venus, “the Bringer of Peace,” for example.\nThe new movie offers a visual correction to Holst's astrological ideas of space.\nThe idea came about after a performance of Holst in 2003 that was accompanied by old planet images, Graf said. Some astronauts on stage for the show were less than impressed with the visual part of the performance, Graf said.\nThe symphony hired Copp to help.\nThe filmmaker, whose doctoral work examined the volcanic and geologic processes of Venus, pieced together the state-of-the-art images into a high-definition movie coordinated with Holst's music.\nThe digital images come from NASA spacecraft. They are mostly in the public domain, Copp said, though most have never been seen by the public.\nIn Copp's movie, the graphics of Saturn are molded to give the viewer the sense of tilting of the planet's rings with the movement of the spacecraft."

Meanwhile “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” will likely still be drawing crowds after its staggering $150-million opening last week.\nAs the war for this year’s Fourth of July box office winner begins, take a look back at the big box office winners and disappointments.\nNote: All box office numbers, and those adjusted for inflation, provided by Box Office Mojo.\nIn a slow year, Prince, John Carpenter and even Disney all took a backseat to the second sequel to the 25-year-old Hitchcock horror classic, although it wasn’t much of a victory as all five wide releases debuted within a few hundred thousand dollars of each other.\nThe summer already had a box office champ in Tim Burton’s “Batman,” released June 23, and also saw box office winners in sequels like “Ghostbusters 2” and “Lethal Weapon 2.” But, for the July 4 weekend, Ralph Macchio and Noriyuki “Pat” Morita were the team to beat.\nThis was another strange calendar year, when July 4 fell on a Monday. Friday, July 1’s openers included “The Shadow” ($11.7 million), “Blown Away” ($10.4 million), “I Love Trouble” ($7.8 million) and “Baby’s Day Out” ($4 million). Zemeckis’ “Gump,” starring Hanks, then opened on Wednesday, July 6, to a big $24.4 million on its way to a stellar $329.6 million domestic and Oscars for picture, director, lead actor and more.\nSmith solidified his status as Mr. Fourth of July when this sci-fi/comedy blasted off at the box office.\nNever mind that “Deep Impact” mined similar story elements just two months earlier. When “Bad Boys” director Michael Bay decided to team with Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Aerosmith, other studios balked at the idea of challenging it for the weekend crown.\nSmith’s July 4 streak came to an abrupt end with this pricey flop based on the 1960s TV show.\nSmith retook the July 4 crown with this pricey sequel. Although it enjoyed a bigger opening that the original, the follow-up’s domestic haul fell short of the previous film’s $250 million total.\nCameron sat this one out, but Schwarzenegger still made the return trip as the futuristic cyborg. The third chapter failed to reach the same box office heights as its precursor, but was enough to win the weekend and keep the franchise afloat.\nSpidey’s second big screen outing swung to a mighty $88 million over the holiday. A victory to be sure, but two years earlier, the original “Spider-Man” opened to a massive $144.8 million.\n2005’s Independence Day went dark, with Steven Spielberg’s bleak update of H.G Wells’ already bleak classic starring Cruise. Audiences still came out in droves, despite the film’s downbeat nature, which was atypical for July 4 fare.\nSome 20 years after Christopher Reeve hung up the cape, and a decade before Henry Cavill suited up, Brandon Routh played the world’s most famous superhero for this one-off from director Bryan Singer."

        "text": "She was out of line, sure. But combined with his attacks on the Washington Post and NBC and others, this is not a comedy.\nIf you think this demand by Trump to fire Bee is simply about Bee using the c-word on her comedy show Wednesday to slam Ivanka’s complicity in Trump’s despicable policy of separating children from parents if they cross the border illegally, you have not been paying attention. Trump has been waging a war on freedom of expression since his campaign which continues through today. His goal is to silence or at least delegitimize those who criticize him—from the news media to comedians like Bee and “Saturday Night Live.” It’s as if Trump is following page by page the “Dictator for Dummies” playbook.\nUntil now, much of the criticism of Trump regarding the Roseanne Barr-Samantha Bee controversy has rightly been about the White House’s swift denunciation of Bee but Trump’s refusal to denounce Barr’s racist tweet that compared former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to an ape. Trump, who had praised Roseanne in March after her show’s premier by personally calling her and then touting her in a rally where he told the crowd the show was “about us,” has still not condemned his long time friend’s racism.\nBut that’s Trump. This is the same guy who refused to denounce David Duke during the campaign when first asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper. And then after Charlottesville, Trump equated the white supremacists with those protesting hate by saying there were “fine people” on both sides. And this is the same Trump, who to the delight of the primarily white crowds at his rallies, will demean visible black people from Jay-Z (as we saw again this week) to Rep. Maxine Waters to NFL players who took a knee to protest institutional racism.\nTrump is a man who trafficked in bigotry and racism to win the White House. It’s vile but it plays well with much of today’s GOP base.\nBut Trump’s attacks on freedom of expression go far beyond just news media. Trump also wants to silence those in the entertainment world who are vocal critics. During the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump demanded Saturday Night Live be cancelled for its “hit job on me,” as Trump put it on Twitter. And even after Trump won, he still slammed SNL as being “terrible,” clearly with the hopes of hurting the show’s ratings.\nAnd now we have Trump calling on Bee to be fired. You know who else hates comedy at their expense? Authoritarian leaders. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a man Trump loves, banned Egypt’s version of The Daily Show because of the way its comedy mocked the government. The show’s star, Bassem Youssef, had to flee the country and is now living in exile with his family.\nTurkey’s strongman leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded the prosecution of a German comedian for simply reading a poem mocking Erdogan. While the case did go to court, it was ultimately dropped. But Erdogan’s intended goal of silencing comedians who dare mock the Turkish leader was heard.\nSo for those who think Trump calling for the firing of Bee is simply about a profane (and obviously indefensible) joke focusing on his daughter, think again. This is all part of Trump’s efforts to follow in the footsteps of people like Vladimir Putin, Sisi, and Erdogan to stifle free speech and criticism. And if we don’t speak out vocally–including Republicans–Trump may actually succeed in turning the United States of America into Trumpistan."

        "text": "OTTAWA—The media’s ability to shield their sources, notes and reporting materials from police “fishing expeditions” could be strengthened after a senior federal Crown attorney made several concessions in a high-profile media case Wednesday at the Supreme Court of Canada.\nVice Media is fighting the RCMP’s effort to seize reporter Ben Makuch’s 2014 texts and communications with Farah Shirdon, a self-declared Canadian ISIS fighter.\nAlthough Shirdon is reported to be dead, the Crown and the RCMP have not given up the pursuit of Vice Media materials, and federal lawyer Croft Michaelson hammered the fact Shirdon could still be alive, could still return to Canada, and the public interest in prosecuting him remains high.\nHe urged the Supreme Court judges not to grant journalists any greater privacy protection against police searches than the state grants anyone involved in a criminal investigation.\n“The newsroom should not be entitled to any more protection than that most sensitive part of human society, the bedroom,” he said.\nHowever Michaelson conceded the common law could be “tweaked” to underline the importance of a journalist’s right to privacy and the right to free expression in a democratic society, and to set out clearer instructions for judges reviewing seizure orders.\nIt was a significant move that sets the stage for the Supreme Court of Canada under its new chief justice, Richard Wagner, and an almost entirely re-cast judicial bench to revisit earlier decisions, and Vice Media’s lawyer Phil Tunley was quick to invite the court to do so.\nTunley called the RCMP’s application for a production order against Vice a “fishing expedition,” saying the chances of prosecution are remote. Makuch, the reporter who communicated with Shirdon over a Kik text messaging app and wrote three articles in 2014 on the Canadian, agreed and went further. He believes Shirdon is dead, and the RCMP is simply trying to expand its reach in a digital age.\nThe case drew a slew of black-robed lawyers for various media organizations who were supportive intervenors. Tunley argued that even a new federal law that requires prior notice to media of police applications for production orders, and sets out other protections for “confidential” sources, doesn’t go far enough because it doesn’t protect communications with “non-confidential” sources.\nVice says Shirdon never asked for nor was granted confidentiality or anonymity by its reporter, and that the reporter’s work materials should remain off limits to the police.\nMichaelson said Canada already has a robust legal framework that sets out a case-by-case analysis which requires courts to weigh the public interest in investigation and prosecution of criminal offences against the public interest in a vibrant free press.\nHowever, several judges challenged whether that was enough or whether additional steps — like advance notice to the media in the first instance when police seek a warrant; or when an appeal judge reviews a warrant or production order — are required to really protect the right.\nJustices Rosalie Abella and Brown asked Michaelson what exactly he believes the Charter protects. He replied the constitutional freedom of expression guarantee expressly protects “freedom of the press” including a right to gather and disseminate information. He conceded that certain protections should be extended not just to “confidential” sources but also to the private, “off the record” or “not for attribution” communications between reporters and their sources who agree to be named.\nMichaelson, a senior Crown attorney who has long prosecuted high-profile criminal and terrorism cases, admitted he occasionally speaks to reporters but only on condition his remarks not be attributed.\nHe suggested the Supreme Court of Canada might want to “tweak the test” in the common law to capture the public interest in freedom of expression, even as he argued it is already recognized.\nAbella pressed Michaelson whether it would be “helpful” if the court outlined specific considerations for appeal courts to use when reviewing a lower court order, rather than sticking to what the current “deferential” model of review that leans toward upholding the authorizing judge’s take.\n“Why not?” said Michaelson. “I mean other courts have, so if you’re inclined to do so, why not to make it clearer” that the standard of review in cases where journalists’s rights are involved “is a modified standard that must reflect” the principles he said the high court has already recognized.\nLawyer Paul Schabas representing a dozen international media organizations called on the Supreme Court to set out a new, clearer test in law as other countries have.\nAnother media lawyer, Justin Safayeni said on top of concerns about a “chilling effect” on sources, or self-censorship by reporters, there could be a real impact on public confidence in the impartiality and independence of the media if reporters are turned into an investigative arm of the police. He argued all of a journalists’ “work product” — notes, source contact lists, and recordings of interviews — should be protected."

        "text": "One bad day on the street and Mike Suznevich concludes that there's something wrong with human kindness: Not enough of it to go around. What can I tell you? The guy drives for a living -- he drives mainly sedans-for-hire -- and he hasn't been doing this for very long. \"About a month and a half,\" he says in a New Jersey accent that makes him sound tougher than he really is. Two incidents in one day left Mike smarting from a compound fracture of his faith in mankind.\nLast Wednesday morning, he stopped the car he drives for On-Time Sedan Service at the corner of Light and Pratt, near the Bell Atlantic building. His passenger was a woman who is legally blind.\nVisually handicapped Baltimoreans frequently use On-Time because they find the sedan service more reliable, albeit more expensive, than public transportation or cabs. After Mike stopped the car and opened the door, his passenger remained in the car to write a check to cover her fare. Then she gathered up her belongings. Apparently this took more time than a certain city traffic officer wanted to allow.\nAs his passenger walked off, Mike turned around and the officer handed him a $32 ticket for parking in a no-stopping zone. \"She [the officer] didn't warn me, didn't speak to me, didn't say a word,\" Mike says. \"When I tried to explain how my passenger needed time getting out of the car, [the officer] didn't want to hear it..... But, that's not all. Let me tell you what happened the same day at the airport, in the afternoon.\"\n\"It was hot, it was humid, it was like 100 degrees. The [cabbie] says,'I don't give..... It's my cab stand.' I said,'What kind of a human being are you?...' I say it's 50-50 out there. A 50 percent chance you'll run into someone who cares, 50 percent that you'll run into someone who doesn't.\" I say he's being optimistic.\nWhat do you think the standard restaurant mark-up of wine is? Two hundred percent over wholesale? Three hundred percent?\nThrough Labor Day, Spike & Charlie's is offering bottles of wine at -- get this -- just a dollar over cost. The Cathedral Street restaurant and wine bar has come up with a \"dog days\" list that, management claims, doesn't contain any dogs.\nTo make sure, I checked with two experts not easily impressed and they were easily impressed. Neither ever heard of a restaurant making such an offer. An Aujoux Beaujolais 1993 for $7 looks good, and one of my consultants likes the $14 bottle of Muller Catoir Riesling Kabinett Halbtrocken'Mussbacher Eselshaut' 1992, which should get three stars just for its name.\nNick: \"Mom, do we have a lawyer?\"\nNick: \"Because we have a phone, and the TV says if we have a phone we have a lawyer.\"\n\"If you have a phone, you have a lawyer\" is the time-worn advertisement for Saiontz & Kirk. Put a twist on the phrase -- \"If you're a lawyer, you need a phone\" -- and you have a possible title for a dispute involving two Baltimore attorneys.\nRonald M. Sharrow and Daniel Cohen are fussing over a phone number. In fact, they've hired lawyers to do the fussing. Cohen and Sharrow, well-known as a pioneer in lawyer advertising, began a contractual association in 1991. Cohen had more than three decades of experience, numerous contacts and clients, and a phone number, 539-0063, of many years.\nThe phone number was important to Cohen. A phone number is important to all lawyers. \"It's your lifeline,\" one remarked yesterday.\nSharrow's attorney, Richard Rosenthal, says Cohen agreed to relinquish his phone number at the end of this three-year association with the Sharrow law firm. But early this year, Cohen decided not to retire at the end of his stint and to return to private practice on his own. And he wanted to take his more than 30-year-old phone number with him.\nNo way, said Sharrow. Cohen offered to buy the number back. Sharrow insisted a deal was a deal and went to court to keep Cohen from using 539-0063. Last Friday, Baltimore Circuit Judge Edward J. Angeletti granted Sharrow's request for an injunction, ordered that Cohen no longer use 539-0063 and that it be transferred to Sharrow. This week, a former federal judge, James R. Miller Jr., will serve as arbiter as the two sides hash it out. Meanwhile, if you're looking for Cohen, his number now is 547-0480.\nAh, summer. Late summer. Soon we'll have more zucchini than anyone wants to be associated with.\nWrite me at: This Just In, 501 N. Calvert St., Baltimore 21278. Or call 332-6166."

        "text": "Video (02:31): Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau discusses a seismic draft-night trade on Thursday that reunites him with All-Star Jimmy Butler.\nAfter 14 months on the job, Timberwolves coach/president of basketball operations Tom Thibodeau made his first trade and also got his man when he swung a seismic trade in Thursday’s NBA draft that reunites him with three-time All-Star and physical defender Jimmy Butler.\nTo get a 27-year-old star he coached for four seasons in Chicago, Thibodeau sent promising youngsters Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn as well as Thursday’s seventh pick to the Bulls.\nThe Wolves also received back the draft’s 16th pick, which the Bulls used to select Creighton 6-11 freshman center Justin Patton for Minnesota. The Bulls used the Wolves’ seventh pick to acquire Arizona 7-foot shooter Lauri Markkanen.\nA year after the two teams discussed such a trade, Thibodeau and General Manager Scott Layden pulled off their first one together.\nIt’s a big one, too — just behind the one in team history that sent superstar Kevin Garnett to Boston in 2007 and probably even with the 2014 trade that sent away Kevin Love and brought Andrew Wiggins.\nIn trading for Jimmy Butler on Thursday night, the Wolves get a three-time All-Star and a physical perimeter defender who turns 28 in September.\nButler gives the Wolves an experienced, physical defender to put beside young stars Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns, both of whom could use some defensive tutoring from one of the league’s best in that department.\nGiven the NBA’s current economics, Butler is a bona fide star signed to a relative bargain contract that pays him $18.7 million this coming season and $19.8 million in 2018-19. He has a $19.8 million player option in 2019-20.\nApparently, Butler will be missed in Chicago.\nTo get Butler back, the Wolves traded LaVine, the 13th player taken in the 2014 and a two-time All-Star dunk contest winner who’s recovering from February knee surgery. They also dealt Dunn, the fifth player in last year’s draft whom the Bulls coveted when the two teams discussed a Butler trade on draft day in 2016.\nThibodeau lauded Dunn’s development more than once when he and Layden held a pre-draft media briefing on Wednesday.\nDuring that briefing, Thibodeau identified the Wolves’ biggest needs as shooting, defense and toughness, and Butler provides all three, but those final two qualities in particular.\nThe last player (30th overall) selected in the 2011 draft’s first round, Butler will turn 28 in September.\nHe was raised in Tomball, Texas, and in Chicago wore uniform No. 21, which was former Wolves superstar Kevin Garnett’s number throughout his Wolves’ career.\nWhen ESPN reached him by telephone about 2 a.m. Friday Paris time, Butler declined to comment. He’s expected to be introduced as a Timberwolf in the middle of next week.\nButler won the NBA’s Most Improved Player award in 2015 after he increased his scoring average from 13.1 points a game to 20 points a game.\nHe accepted that award about the same time the Bulls fired Thibodeau after five years as their coach. The divorce between Thibodeau and Bulls management ended messily, but the two sides came together enough Thursday to make a deal that fit a Wolves team prepared to make a leap forward and a Bulls team ready to rebuild without Butler challenging coach Fred Hoiberg’s authority, which Butler did regularly last season.\nThe trade was finalized, according to the Chicago Tribune, with a phone call between Thibodeau and Bulls VP John Paxson.\nThe Chicago Bulls traded Jimmy Butler to the Wolves on Thursday night.\nPaxson called it “great” for a Wolves team that has accumulated enough young assets to make such a trade. He said he hopes his team will now do that, too.\n“It sets our course and what we need to do,” Paxson said.\nA 6-7 forward, Butler has played all his six NBA seasons in Chicago. He was named to the East’s All-Star team in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and was named All-NBA third team after this past season."

        "text": "Anyone who’s ever been frustrated at the task of shooting video in low light should be poised to freak out over Canon’s weird and amazing new camera. It’s a video camera that shoots full HD color footage in almost complete darkness.\nThe ‘multi-purpose’ camera, dubbed only MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the meager resolution is because each pixel is very large—19 microns to be exact. That’s 7.5x larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx. Huge pixels mean they can capture a huge amount of light.\nIn this case, Canon’s sensor reaches an insane 4,000,000 ISO. Yeah, four million. Basically it sees better in the dark than you can. Remember, this is without infrared night vision tricks. It’s normal color 1080p video at 24, 30, or 60 fps.\nBefore you get excited at what this means for your gritty neo-noir short film set in an dark alley, let me tell you that this camera is not meant for most consumers. First off, it’s $30,000. And it’s made for “industrial” uses. Not sure what that really means, but Canon mentioned things like nighttime surveillance and wildlife documentaries. Something tells me many crazies will think of other cool uses for it. It’s pretty small, at about 4 x 4 x 4 inches, so that will make it versatile for interesting shooting situations.\nThe point of this seems to be for Canon to show off that it still innovates. It’s taken quite a lot of heat from camera enthusiasts in the past couple of years for falling behind in bringing new and forward-thinking features to market. Though proving people wrong with a $30,000 device is an interesting way to go.\nIn any case, we can all look forward to eye-popping nighttime footage coming out of this thing in the near future when the camera ships in December."

Well, some startups are focusing on ensuring that Ruby on Rails, also known simply as Rails, does indeed scale.\nRuby on Rails, like the Ruby language it is based on, has been used in several Web 2.0 applications such as Twitter, Jobster and Shopify, as well as beginning to appear in a number of enterprise applications. However, despite many success stories, what tends to stand out are the tales of how Rails took a development project 95 percent of the way to the Promised Land of enterprise scalability but needed a boost from some other language to get the application over the hump.\nSteven Beales, chief software architect at Mdlogix (Medical Decision Logic) said Mdlogix views Rails as the most productive tool it has for developing simple-looking Web applications with advanced functionality. However, Mdlogix is also using Rails for enterprise development.\nAnd for enterprise organizations concerned about issues of scalability and performance with Rails, help is on the way.\nA startup called New Relic, backed by venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, and particularly by Benchmark General Partner Peter Fenton, who has made some big bets in funding companies like JBoss, Red Hat, MySQL and SpringSource, has launched to address Ruby on Rails application performance management.\nRuby shines on all platforms. Click here to read more.\nNew Relic announced on May 1 that it had received $3.5 million in first-round venture financing from Benchmark Capital. The company plans to use the funds to drive product development and to expand sales and marketing programs, and Fenton will join its board of directors.\nNew Relic RPM, a subscription-based Rails performance management solution, enables developers to quickly and cost effectively detect, diagnose and fix application performance problems in real time, the company said. This SAAS (software as a service) offering is currently available to a limited customer base as a private beta, but will be generally available to the entire Ruby on Rails community soon.\nLewis Cirne, founder of New Relic, founded Wily Technology in 1998, which provided the same type of solution for Java. Cirne said he views Rails as the same kind of game-changing technology that Java has proven to be. Cirne eventually sold Wily to CA.\n\"The critiques we hear about Rails [are] it's not scalable, that it's not well-suited for mission-critical applications,\" Fenton said. \"I think those critiques are similar in nature to what we heard about Java in the mid-90s.\"\nHowever, to find problems and to help applications scale, \"You have to find out where the bottlenecks are,\" which is what New Relic does, Fenton said. \"The monitoring insight New Relic has is to provide visibility without adding overhead.\"\nMoreover, Fenton, who said Cirne's Wily Technology firm was the first investment he made at Benchmark, added that Benchmark's commitment to Rails is as deep as its commitment to Java in the'90s. \"Couple that with cloud computing and this [Rails] could be much more rapidly adopted than Java,\" Fenton said.\nMoreover, Fenton said he believes Rails could be \"as big a force for change for developers\" as cloud computing may be.\n\"We're really excited about the software-as-a-service model,\" Cirne said. He said New Relic will officially launch in 30 to 60 days. The company's private beta consists of about 50 customers that New Relic is helping to scale their Rails applications. And Cirne said the company will offer a developer version of its solution to complement the production version of RPM."

He fell in love with the dish so deeply that he now sells it at his own Com Tam Ba Son Restaurant.\nOpened in Ho Chi Minh City eight weeks ago, the venture has been successful so far.\nHis wife's family has been selling com tam in the Mekong Delta province of Dong Thap for decades. His uncle-in-law is still running the original Com Tam Ba Son Restaurant there.\n\"It's not a franchise. It's a family business,\" Ludwig says.\nBefore coming up with the restaurant idea, he was thinking of retiring after 10 years of doing businesses in Vietnam.\nFor the first six years, he worked for Siemens group, an electronics giant from Germany, as CEO of the Communications Division. He looked after branches in Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan and South Korea from HCMC.\nHe was then appointed the position of CEO of Communications for China. The job required him and his wife to move to Hong Kong.\nThey lived there for fourteen months but they did not like the life there, so they returned and he started his new job in 2010 as General Director of the Schindler Ltd. Vietnam, specializing in elevator and escalator equipment sales.\nBut he decided to step out of the executive management last year and knew that he would need to do something to keep himself busy if he were to retire.\nThe idea of opening the com tam restaurant came from his wife.\nThey called their parents for help and chose the Phu My Hung urban area in District 7 because Ludwig wanted to have a clean environment and a location that would attract foreign customers.\n\"I know they want to see a foreign face, and maybe they feel more confident about the food,\" he says.\nTran Thi Hong Hoa, his mother-in-law, has moved to the city to help out. She too was thinking about retiring, but she can't get enough of selling com tam.\nHoa now takes care of the kitchen as the main cook. Ludwig is in charge of management.\nSpeaking about his strategy to compete with the city's thousands of com tam shops, Ludwig said firmly that what makes people keep coming back to his place is the quality of the food, the restaurant's environment as well as its service.\nAs a businessman, he knows how to make \"Com Tam Ba Son\" a famous brand. \"To develop a brand, we need to have sustainable quality,\" he says.\nHe says that along with quality ingredients, it's cleanliness - from the table to the kitchen to the restroom - is the primary standard at his restaurant.\n\"Clean, very clean, and professional as much as possible. We've also trained our waiters and waitresses very carefully to make sure they bring good service,\" he said.\nHe said the prices were a bit high because of the quality of the meat.\nApart from com tam, Ludwig's Com Tam Ba Son also offers a few German specialties: sausages and beer.\n\"Vietnamese can eat com tam everyday, but foreigners cannot,\" he says.\nLudwig is also super proud of the homemade lasagna he makes himself and sells at the shop. He smiles brightly as he shows it off, like a child happy with a major achievement.\nThe best thing about Com Tam Ba Son is the secrete meat marinade and fish sauce made with his mother-in-law's family recipe, handed down from generation to generation.\nLudwig's favorite \"funny and surprising story\" from his shop is about the day a group of Vietnamese people on motorbikes stopped at his place and ordered some com tam to take away.\nThey looked at the menu prices of around VND55,000-70,000 per dish of com tam, and complained that the price was too high, and that they could have the same com tam at half of those prices at a place not very far from there.\nBut they decided to try Ludwig's com tam, and now they come back almost every day.\nOnly two among his 15 waiters and waitresses speak good English so he and his wife are there to help foreigners.\nkeep themselves busy. What I like more in Vietnam is that we always have a lot of business opportunities. If you have some particular good idea, and you are keen on it, you can easily get success,\" he said.\nAt the moment, Ludwig still runs his own company in Germany apart from Com Tam Ba Son, but he spends almost all his time in Vietnam and just looks out for that company via phone or email through a general director over there."

See them below.\nI told my husband not to read this post — because, spoiler alert, it has a lot of his gifts. He told me he wanted “whisky and hot sauce” for Christmas, so I got him the super cool Game Of Thrones White Walker by Johnnie Walker scotch whiskey. You are meant to serve it chilled, and the bottle “ices” when it’s frozen — so cool! You can pour it into the Rabbit Freezable Whiskey Glasses! Rabbit has the best bar accessories! I’m also gifting him the FabFitFun box — their very first men’s box — because, to be honest, I’m 6 months pregnant and they did all the work for me. It has cute socks, grooming products, headphones and more — a little bit of everything.\nI’m also getting him a Starbucks gift card, because men love practical gifts. Kiehl’s and RITUALS have really great skincare and shaving sets, which again, are super easy to gift as is. A great gift for Dad is the Timex Waterbury Traditional Chronograph Watch, which is a timeless design. It’s made of stainless steel and a genuine leather strap, but is still an affordable $149. Bellacosa’s Cabernet Sauvignon is a great bottle that’s not too fancy to drink on a “regular Wednesday” night. It would pair incredibly well with a steak from Gallaghers. The iconic NYC steakhouse has gift boxes of steaks that ship nationwide, and are delicious.\nThere are colognes, shaving sets, grooming kits, an ugly christmas sweater, and much more in my gift guide, so check out the gallery attached above to get some shopping inspiration!"

        "text": "US negotiators are expected to meet in the Qatari capital of Doha this week with representatives of the Taliban, the Islamist movement that the US toppled from power nearly a dozen years ago, only to fight a war with it and other Afghans opposed to foreign occupation ever since.\nThe talks triggered a political crisis before they even began, with US-backed Afghan president Hamid Karzai issuing a public protest that he had been lied to about US intentions in meeting with the Taliban. In retaliation, he formally broke off talks with Washington on a Bilateral Security Agreement that would provide for US troops remaining in the country after the December 2014 deadline that Washington and NATO have set for withdrawing all their forces.\nJust hours before the Obama White House announced the planned talks with the Taliban, four US soldiers were killed in a mortar attack on the heavily fortified Bagram Airfield, north of Kabul. The Taliban claimed credit for the attack and reported that it had wounded six other troops.\nTwenty-three US troops have been killed so far this month, bringing the total number to have lost their lives since the launching of Operation Enduring Freedom in October 2001 to 2,243. Another 444 British troops as well as 653 from other NATO and US-aligned countries have also died.\nAfghan casualties undoubtedly number in the hundreds of thousands. According to the United Nations, the number of civilians killed or wounded from the beginning of this year until June 6 reached 3,092, a 24 percent increase over the same period last year. And the Afghan NGO Security Office reported that there were 47 percent more attacks launched by the Taliban and other groups opposed to the government and the foreign troops that support it in the first quarter of this year than in the same period in the first quarter of 2011.\nAs for the Afghan forces, while the army has 350,000 troops on the books, they are poorly trained and armed and are suffering heavy casualties as well as morale problems that lead to a loss of about a third of their ranks each year through desertions and failure to re-enlist. According to a Pentagon report issued last December, only 1 out of 23 Afghanistan National Army brigades is capable of operating on its own without US-NATO support.\nGiven the state of the Afghan military and the pledge to withdraw the bulk of the US-NATO troops by the end of next year, the Taliban appears to be going into the talks with the US and its puppet regime with a fair amount of confidence and is showing no inclination to put down its arms any time soon.\nAccording to Afghan officials, the Karzai regime was angered by the Taliban’s presentation of its office in Doha not merely as an outpost for peace talks, but rather a virtual embassy for a rival government. One official who spoke to the Reuters news agency cited in particular the hoisting over the office of a Taliban flag and a banner of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the Taliban regime was known before it was overthrown by the US in 2001.\nKarzai apparently fears that the US could reach a deal with the Taliban at his expense. Given Washington’s increasing reliance on Islamist forces in Egypt and Turkey and in the wars it has instigated in Libya and Syria, such a concern is understandable.\nUS officials have publicly stated that they are seeking three commitments by the Taliban as the sole basis for a settlement: a formal break of all ties with Al Qaeda, an end to armed actions and acceptance of the Afghan constitution, an undemocratic document rammed through an unrepresentative loya jirga (tribal council) dominated by Karzai’s hand-picked delegates and Afghan warlords in 2004.\nAl Qaeda today does not represent any significant force in Afghanistan, and its invocation by Washington is aimed more at maintaining the pretext that the war there is part of a “war on terror.” The reality is that the Bush administration could have negotiated such a break when the Taliban was in power, but instead chose to invade Afghanistan, initiating the 12-year war. Even before the September 2001 attacks, the Taliban leadership had attempted to broker an agreement with Washington to remove Osama bin Laden and bring him to trial, but US officials showed no interest.\nThe unstated commitment that the US is most interested in securing from the Taliban is the acceptance of a continued US military presence in the country and US imperialism’s use of the Afghanistan as a forward base in projecting its power into Central and South Asia as well as against China."

        "text": "Newswise — October 27, 2017 – Plastic surgeons using social media to attract patients should know their audience's preferred social media platforms and the types of posts of greatest interest, according to a survey study in the November issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).\n\"Plastic surgeons can utilize social media best by considering their target audience's perspective,\" said Heather Furnas, MD, of Plastic Surgery Associates of Santa Rosa, Calif. Dr. Furnas is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The survey also suggests that patients rely on the plastic surgery practice's website over social media when seeking important information.\nDr. Furnas and coauthors surveyed 100 patients making visits to their aesthetic plastic surgery practice regarding social media habits and preferences. The patients, average age 44 years, were nearly all women. Most were interested in facial plastic surgery; some were interested in breast, body, or other cosmetic procedures.\nMost patients used YouTube and Pinterest, but engagement was low. While only about one-fourth of patients were on Snapchat, most of them used it daily. Twitter was the least popular social media platform.\nThe plastic surgery practice's website beat out all social media platforms as the go-to source of online information. More than half of patients said they were influenced by the website when selecting a cosmetic surgery practice, compared to just eight percent for Facebook. More than 60 percent of patients checked the practice website on the day of their visit.\nOut of 11 social media post categories, most patients chose before-and-after photos of cosmetic surgery procedures. More than one-fourth wanted to see information about the procedures; few selected didactic types of information.\nPlastic surgeons can better reach and engage with their target population if they use the social media networks popular with their patients’ demographic. For example, women prefer Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest, but Facebook in particular is most popular among the age group of women most likely to be interested in plastic surgery. While Twitter is widely used by plastic surgeons to share and discuss research, the new survey suggests it's the least popular platform among cosmetic surgery patients.\nThe fleeting content on social media may be less important than the information provided by the plastic surgeon's practice website.\n\"These results suggest that the website should be considered the centerpiece of a practice's online content,\" Dr. Furnas and coauthors write. \"Social media should be viewed as an adjunct to attract and engage users, enticing them to explore the practice website.\"\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer.\nWolters Kluwer reported 2016 annual revenues of €4.3 billion. The company, headquartered in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands, serves customers in more than 180 countries, maintains operations in more than 40 countries and employs 19,000 people worldwide.\nWolters Kluwer Health is a leading global provider of information and point of care solutions for the health care industry.

Together the company is better positioned to capture more of the market than individually. There are areas where we can supply a number of different services to clients, and we know that some of the oil companies prefer to have larger suppliers.\nWith an annual turnover of around £119m, the group will be fully established by 1 January.\nWhat effects will the fall of oil prices actually have?"

        "text": "Forget the war in Iraq, the war on terror or any other war against which Connecticut citizens are said to have voted by defeating Joe Lieberman and nominating Ned Lamont for the U.S. Senate.\nThe operative war for American citizens is something closer to home -- a war of independence from the bickering partisans who have made political life in America a childish and tedious exercise.\nDemocrats aren't wrong when they say that the Lamont victory was a defining moment. It defined the Democratic Party as a vigorous, motivated, organized force that is.... completely out of touch with mainstream America.\nDon't get me wrong. Lamont is a perfectly respectable candidate -- well-spoken, attractive, gracious and rich. What's not to like? And millions of Americans of every political stripe are disgusted with the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war.\nBut what happened in Connecticut allowed the rest of the country a close glimpse of what the Democratic Party has become -- a ruthless machine of the far left, fueled by left-wing blogs and personified by the stubbornly adolescent Michael Moore.\nTheir triumph in bringing down Lieberman may prove to be their undoing in November, as well as in the 2008 presidential election. Here's why: Americans may not like the war, or the deficit, or the Bush administration's immigration stance, or pick-your-grievance. We enjoy a surfeit of issues to divide us. But Americans also share a reflexive resistance to Stalinist tactics.\nWhat else can one call the message now being telegraphed to Democratic leaders? You either stand with us against the war in Iraq, or we take you down.\nThe morning after Lamont's victory, for instance, Moore posted a note on his Web site to Democratic candidates that is a threat without the veil. He specifically targeted Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and John Edwards, all likely presidential candidates in'08.\nNoting that nearly every Democrat planning to run for president had voted for or supported the war, Moore said, \"we are going to make sure they pay for that mistake. Payback time started last night.\"\nEven though both Kerry and Edwards have changed their minds and are now anti-war, that's too late for Moore, who wrote: \"Their massive error in judgment is, sadly, proof that they are not fit for the job. They sided with Bush, and for that, they may never enter the promised land.\"\nTo Clinton, he spoke directly: \"I'm here to tell you that you will never make it through the Democratic primaries unless you start now by strongly opposing the war. It is your only hope.\"\nAs for the rest, \"To every Democratic Senator and Congressman who continues to back Bush's War, allow me to inform you that your days in elective office are now numbered. Myself and tens of millions of citizens are going to work hard to actively remove you from any position of power.\"\nMoore's manifesto, through which he may have lost a few grammarians, is straight out of Stalin's playbook under \"P\" for purge. Like Stalin, the operatives who ousted Lieberman are determined to remove dissidents from The Party.\nClinton, among others, snapped to. Looking grim before television cameras, she vowed her allegiance to the party, promising to support Lamont in the general election against Lieberman, who is running as an independent. And though Clinton has resisted calls for a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq, she recently hammered Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in an apparent attempt to distance herself from the administration.\nKerry and Edwards similarly have reiterated their party allegiance. Genuflection noted.\nFlash to Connecticut immediately after the count, and Lamont's victory photo tells the rest of the story. There they were, those two perennial groupies to irrelevancy, the twin reverends Sharpton and Jackson. Heaven forbid a Democrat should give an acceptance speech without their pandered presence.\nLieberman -- admired by centrists and conservatives -- promises to stay his own course as a nonpartisan independent. His decision may be viewed as a blasphemous, punishable offense by the MoveOn/Moore wing of his party, but he's hitting a note that rings true for the times.\nThe extremes of both parties -- whether the Michael Moore left or Pat Robertson right -- have had their day, and most sensible Americans have had enough of both. The independent candidate, who puts state and country above party, may be the right candidate in this climate, while the Democratic Party -- now fully revealed as a radical, anti-war, far-left party -- may have written its own suicide note.\nWorking title: When Hari Met Kari."

        "text": "Jewel Samad/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Melody C. Barnes preparing to play golf with President Obama on Sunday in Fort Belvoir, Va.\nMelody C. Barnes, a White House aide, broke through President Obama’s green ceiling Sunday afternoon.\nMs. Barnes, the president’s chief domestic policy adviser, became the first woman to play a round of golf with Mr. Obama since he tee’d off his presidency in January. The milestone is noteworthy as Mr. Obama has come under criticism recently for hosting a basketball game earlier this month for members of his cabinet and congress that included no women (“Bunk,” Mr. Obama told NBC in an interview last week when asked about the controversy over the estrogen-free game).\nShortly after 1 p.m. on a crisp and sunny fall afternoon, Mr. Obama and Ms. Barnes took to the links at the U.S Army’s Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The president wore a black short-sleeve shirt while Ms. Barnes donned a baseball cap and a dark long-sleeve shirt, according to a White House pool report prepared by Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIt was not immediately known what Mr. Obama and Ms. Barnes shot on Sunday.\nThis story is “Bunk”! Having a slow news day, New York Times?\nWhen it came to having women in the inner circle, Obama talks a good game but W walked it where O merely talks it.\nWho cares? I like to play golf with the guys just to be a guy… talk sports, have a beer, tell off-color jokes. The President (any president) has to spend all day being PC and inclusive with the pressure of providing for a nation of people, fighting two wars, and dealing with global crises. Let the guy play some basketball with the guys or pick his Sunday foursome with whomever he wants. Yeesh… this is NOT news.\nI thought the Silly Season ended on Labor Day.\nI hope she didn’t “let him” win!\nI think Obama has long since proved his bona fides as a strong feminist.\nBut does the absurd media coverage the all-male basketball game has received mean that every time Obama moves a muscle, it wlll be scrutinized for politically correctness according to extreme feminists???\nWell, I am certainly confident that anyone who considers the all-male basketball game to be serious evidence of Obama’s sexism would never condone a bunch of women getting together without a male present.\nWhat is this, cable? I read the Times to get away from this silliness.\nSeriously? Who cares who he plays golf with? Who cares what kind of clothes he or his guest was wearing? You would think the New York Times would have more to report on with two wars going on and Obama’s rating in the toilet.\nI’ve always been a tomboy…sports fan, more comfortable hanging with the guys. I totally understand the bond amongst men, often centered around beer, sports, cigars (i.e. fun stuff!). It’s a wonderful thing, just like the unique bond amongst women. The problem arises when work and important decisions are made during these all-male activities, whether intentional or not. I don’t know what to say ladies…take up golf I suppose.\nUnbelievable. This is “political correctness” without common sense. Dangerous.\nI am ok if there are baby showers were just women are invited, I am ok if there are sports team only for girls, I am ok if there are bathrooms only for women, and I am ok if the President chooses to play sports with men. People can read way too much into things, and forget context, common sense, perspective and also a bit of humor.\nHonestly, if the original story had not been on the front page, I would have thought it was a story from The Onion. I guess when the media is on a quest to find fault with someone, all areas are open.\nShouldn’t Obama first decide about troops in Afghainstan before he takes time off to play golf?\nmy father made me take golf lessons during junior high school and high school – he said it was for my future. he was right… once the office found out that I played golf, I was invited to play with the “guys.” it’s true… a lot of work issues are discussed during a game – I don’t think it’s intentional but it happens.\nYeah, John Drew, just like it’s a lot easier to be a right wing Christian if you don’t apply all those silly principles to your own life–you know, the ones about feeding the poor, loving your neighbor, and all that nonesense.\nOh, puh-leeeze. Is there really nothing else to talk about?\nMany times men are establishing relationships that further their careers when they get togther in activites such as these. Decisions are often made in such settings. If the all male club is sustained, women are put at a disadvantage. The people invited to such events are often the real inner circle. When women are excluded, they are put at a disadvantage.\nIf HRC had been elected president, how would men like it if she only invited women to all social functions and shut out men? My question is hypothetical since HRC did not win, but it would be interesting to see men’s reactions to such a scenario.\nFor all of Obama’s talk, I do think he harbors sexist attitudes.\n“When it came to having women in the inner circle, Obama talks a good game but W walked it where O merely talks it.\nIn response to Liz: If you are playing golf with people who are talking about work you aren’t really playing golf.\nFirst of all, obviously the president and his staff seems to have realized that this is a problem. Why else, all of a sudden, Melody Barnes is playing golf with him?\nSecond, to all those people dismissing this story: it’s not “just” a basketball game. Things like these might seem harmless on the surface, but can actually have a deleterious effect on women’s upward movement in the workplace. It is exactly these kinds of informal, male networks that can give men the edge, when it comes time for performance reviews, bonuses, allocation of juicy assignments, promotions, etc.\nThis doesn’t mean that men aren’t allowed to play basketball anymore. It just means that corporate bosses need to be a lot of more sensitive about organizing after-work activities that are inclusive of everyone. If that means that you don’t play basketball with your office, but with an external community league, so be it. It won’t be the end of the world. Being an egalitarian leader means having to make some sacrifices.\nGood for both of them.\nWe women who golf learned a long time ago that it helps solidify relationships, make men more comfortable off the course, and allows boht players to witness outside the office what we should already know from inside the office – namely, how people behave when things go your way – and when they don’t. Is it with honesty, humility, humor, and strength? It’s a great litmus test for any relationship, professional and personal. Good for President Obama for opening up the game.\nWhat Obama organized is a text book example of a boys-only club.\nThe president is never “off duty,” particularly when interacting with his employees.\nEvery moment of the president’s day is scheduled. An opportunity to spend time with him is precious to anyone who wants to have an influence on public policy. That’s why some people spend tens – if not hundreds – of thousands of dollars to play a round with him. This is Politics 101.\nEvery nay-saying commenter here acknowledged that these games help the president bond with his staff and other advisors. Bonding with your boss is important. Women deserve an equal opportunity to do this.\nIf you don’t think its a problem that, after 22 golf games and numerous basketball games, NO women – until now – were given an equal opportunity to get face time and bond with the president, you are both a sexist and an ignoramus.\nAnd don’t fool yourselves – if a president Hillary Clinton organized 22+ golf games and a dozen bridge games and didn’t invite any male staff, you male reporters and pundits and commenters would be shrieking with outrage. You’d be crying about man-hating and calling for her impeachment. Admit it.\nWe do NOT need a White House modeled on Mad Men. If that’s the change B. has in mind, he can stuff it."

McDaniels, who said it was \"crazy\" for a rap star to be included, a sentiment echoed by LL Cool J, who described himself and his friend as \"the guys on the other side of the tracks\".\nHe added: \"I want you to know that the inner city is a whirlpool. Every now and then somebody like me will make it out.\n\"What you're looking at is possibilities - what every young inner-city black man could potentially be if given the opportunity and if someone put their arm around him.\"\nAnd after the event, the'Phenomenon' singer paid tribute to other hip hop stars on his Instagram account.\nHe wrote: \"I believe that we are built to do anything we put our minds and proper actions to. You have all the tools inside you that are required for you to fulfill your GOD given purpose.\n\"This one is for those who came before me and those who followed me. We were sent to this planet to love and inspire one another. Manifest our dreams and make them a reality.

        "text": "James Howell Jr. lost big two years ago when Hurricane Matthew swelled the Tar River, less than a half mile from his home. Finally persuaded it was too dangerous to stay, he returned two days later to discover that two feet of standing water had turned his insulation moldy, forcing a rebuild of his living room.\nNow a sofa and other furniture rest under tarps on his small front porch as he and his wife Gloria prepare for Hurricane Florence, which is shaping up to be much bigger and wetter, dumping rain that could be measured in feet.\n\"It's scaring me to death,\" Howell said. \"If I lose my place, I ain't coming back. I'm not coming back to Princeville no more.\"\nHowell figures he has two options if he needs to flee. His daughter lives about 30 miles west, away from the river. That's where he said he'd be taking his most prized possessions, already loaded aboard his pickup. His granddaughter, meanwhile, is staying in a secure motel thanks to her retail employer, so he and his wife may be able to rest there.\nThe rich have long claimed higher ground along waterways. That left freed slaves to build their homes on bottomland. That's where Princeville became the country's first town incorporated by black Americans. The land about 75 miles (121 kilometers) east of Raleigh has been repeatedly inundated by the Tar River -- at least eight times before Matthew. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd's rains overwhelmed a dike and submerged the town in water 23 feet (7 meters) deep in spots.\nMany people with limited means, like the disabled Howells, will struggle to escape and rebuild after Florence's damage is done.\nThe median household income of Princeville's 2,300 residents is about $28,000 a year compared to the statewide $48,000, and almost six of ten town residents had public health insurance such as Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.\nForecasters are warning anyone living near waterways in the Carolinas to seek higher ground, and that means trouble for some of the poorest communities in eastern North Carolina and South Carolina where black people have faced historic inequality.\n\"What I'm fearful about is there are a lot of people who are not going to be OK because they don't have elevated structures,\" said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. \"They're in low-lying flood prone areas and they didn't leave because they had nowhere to go and no resources to get there.\"\nPeople still haven't recovered fully from Matthew in small, economically struggling communities across eastern North Carolina, from Seven Springs and Windsor near Virginia's border to Lumberton along the South Carolina line.\nGov. Roy Cooper, elected weeks after that hurricane hit, promised Tuesday that low-income people won't be left to fend for themselves during this storm. The state is using detailed mapping to pinpoint potential flooding from Florence, and sharing that information to help local authorities warn people to move.\n\"The idea is to have those shelters available to people on higher ground, and no matter what their income, we want to get people out of places that may be flooding,\" Cooper said.\nIn Beaufort County, more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) east of Raleigh, emergency management officials will use school buses Wednesday to move residents living in flood-prone areas to higher ground in Washington, the county seat, where a high school will shelter up to 500 people. The county is split by the broad Pamlico River and some of the 45,000 residents lack vehicles to reach the shelter on their own.\n\"We are trying to provide transportation where they do not have transportation,\" said Carnie Hedgepeth, the county's emergency services director.\nRetired sisters Clydie Gardner, 71, and Dorothy Pope, 78, ran in 2016 as floodwaters spread toward their home, just before a massive oak tree, its roots loosened by Matthew's rain, toppled onto the building. They're seeking shelter this time in an aunt's home on higher ground across the river.\n\"They're saying it's 400 miles wide. There's no telling what it might do,\" Pope said. \"When the water starts coming and I see it coming, I'm moving.\""

        "text": "In one of the biggest political upsets this year, conservative lawyer Joe Miller toppled incumbent Senator Lisa Murkowski in Alaska's GOP primary. Though Murkowski conceded defeat to the Sarah Palin endorsed candidate, she quickly flipped the script, launching a quixotic write-in campaign to keep her Senate seat. The initial reactions to her divisive move weren't kind, but moderate Republicans jumped on board and Murkowski's campaign became symbolic of the larger in-fighting between the GOP establishment and the Tea Party. The latest wave of polling now shows Murkowski \"deadlocked\" with Joe Miller, and ahead of Democrat Scott McAdams. Pundits are giving a second (or third or fourth) look at the possibility of the Alaskan Senator reclaiming her seat.\n'Don't Count Her Out Yet' observes Jay Newton-Small at Time. \"Miller's candidacy has provoked panic in the state and local employees' unions, including the firefighter, police and teachers' associations, and all of Alaska's native tribes,\" he figures. And while Murkowski would be the first candidate to win a write-in bid since Strom Thurmond in 1954, \"She hails from a state known for voting with its wallet, and that wallet has been thin of late.\"\nPolling This Race Will Be Difficult explains blogger Allahpundit at Hot Air. \"Polls of this race are tricky twice over, once because Alaska is notoriously difficult to gauge and twice because the nature of Murkowski’s candidacy poses a dilemma for the pollster. Do you do it the way Scott Rasmussen does it, offering respondents a choice between Miller and McAdams to reflect the choices on the ballot and letting them volunteer Murkowski’s name instead? Or do you name all three candidates and ask if respondents will be'writing in' Murkowski?\"\nThe Whole Process Takes Tremendous Voter Education finds The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza who quotes Jean Craciun from Alaska-based Craciun Research. \"You cannot entirely compensate for a write-in candidate and that's why the margin is significant in this case,\" Craciun told the Post. \"We know the intent of voters at this point -- and more than 40% of Alaskans polled are with Lisa. Now it will be Lisa's job to teach Alaskans how to show their intent on Election Day.\"\nOne Big Caveat Politico's Andy Barr hedges, \"While the polls are good news for Murkowski, neither survey was able to gauge the likelihood that voters will indeed write in Murkowski’s name on the ballot—or if they will be able to correctly do so in order for their vote to be counted.\" Still, she,\"appears to be pulling enough Republicans away from Miller and Democrats from McAdams to make it a race.\"\nLet's Look at the Upside writes pollster Nate Silver at The New York Times: \"As we had noted earlier, it is probably the case that polls that treat write-in bids as though they are conventional ones overestimate their support — but it is very difficult to say how large the effect is.\"\nMiller Has the Edge even though the most recent polls show that the incumbent has \"essentially\" pulled even, The American Spectator's Philip Klein isn't quite sure she can eke out a win: \"One would have to think that Murkowski's name not being on the ballot will cost her a lot of votes, thus I'd still be inclined to give Miller the edge unless polls start to show Murkowski with a big lead.\"\nIt's Over Already declares blogger Ian Lazaran at Conservatives 4 Palin. \"If Murkowski cannot get ahead of Miller even when pollsters include her name as an option, there's no way she'll ever be able to pull ahead as her name will not appear on the ballot in reality. Murkowski had previously effectively claimed that she would take the lead if her name was included in polling but her claims were proven false....So even under the most favorable poll that Murkowski could have asked for, she's still trailing Joe Miller.\""

Still, it flows with the help of three major tributaries: Chamokane Creek, Hangman Creek and the Little Spokane River.\nThe participating artists will display their wares at five locations within minutes of each other and the river. Two of the sites are actually next door to each other in parklike settings where a creek runs through the properties of Smith and Gina Freuen. There, greeters will guide visitors to designated areas including the artists’ studios.\nBoth Smith and Freuen are ceramic artists and their studios will allow visitors to be privy to their processes; Smith’s raku work and Freuen’s curious porcelain and stoneware vessels. Freuen will be sharing her outdoor setting with jewelry artist Cheryl DeGroot, photographer Doug Edmonson whose realistic photos form abstract concepts, glass artists Katie Patten and Leonard Tinnell, painter Jessie Rasche, and Will Richards who creates organic-looking lamps from the shades to the ceramic bases.\nSmith will host the works of three other ceramic artists as well as the work of AnnMarie Lewis (Tacky Cowgirl) who handcrafts handbags and aprons.\nThe three other studios on the tour will be hosted by nationally known garment designer Hulda Bridgeman, painter Victoria Brace whose specialty is portraits, and Patti Osebold, who makes Japanese sculptural figures out of clay, and dressed in hand-made decorative paper.\nA spring that flows off the aquifer to the Little Spokane River runs through Bridgeman’s property, where visitors will be guided by ribbons and life-sized stuffed dolls that point the way to artists Sheila Evans, Neicy Frey and Katherine Nelson.\nBrace will open her front door to reveal the works of papier-mâché artist Rhea Giffin, painter and mixed-media sculptor Dara Harvey, painter Gordon Wilson, and jewelry maker Kris Howell. Osebold will welcome visitors into her home where jewelry artists John Blessent and Deb Ellis, and painter Pauline Haas will be exhibiting their work.\nLight refreshments will be served at each site but a food stand will be set up near Smith and Freuen’s with parts of the proceeds going to the Friends of the Little Spokane River Valley whose mission is to preserve and sustain the area."

The president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, warned earlier this summer that athletes who bowed out of competition without a good reason would face sanctions.\nBahram Afsharzadeh, secretary-general of the Iranian Olympic committee, seemed to swear off any boycott in his remarks. “We just follow the sportsmanship and play every country,” Afsharzadeh was quoted as saying by the Associated Press and other outlets Monday.\nThe Associated Press noted that at times, Afsharzadeh had been speaking through an interpreter. In Iran, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Tuesday that his words had been twisted, saying that Afsharzadeh had never named Israel in his remarks.\nThe debate may be a purely symbolic one: Iranian athletes are unlikely to face Israelis in competition at all, with the two countries sending few Olympians in the same categories, according to Israeli media.\nAn Iranian judo practitioner who might have faced an Israeli in competition, Javad Mahjoub, is reportedly missing the Games due to gastric illness -- a withdrawal that some have eyed suspiciously. In the past, Mahjoub told Iranian media he had deliberately lost a match to avoid facing off with an Israeli.\nThe International Olympic Committee said it was impossible to know at this stage whether any of the countries' athletes would face each other, \"as it will depend on qualifiers during the Games.\"\nIn several countries across the Middle East, Olympians have faced pressure to sidestep competing against Israeli athletes as a political statement. Some Iranian athletes avoided matches with Israelis by withdrawing from events at the Olympics in 2004 and 2008, according to the Associated Press.\nThe Olympics come at a time of continuing tensions between the two counties: Iran and Israel have long been at odds over Iran's disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is solely for peaceful purposes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah and its Iranian backers for a recent bombing targeting Israeli tourists in Bulgaria, an allegation Iran has denied."

Kenyans selected for the course would then take part in making a film short or two that highlighted elements of contemporary Kenyan culture.\n“More than 300 Kenyans applied to take the course,” says Evie Maina, the former anchorwoman of local TV shows like KBC’s Art-itude and Arts and Culture as well as KTN’s Artistic Thursday.\n“The final cut was just 14,” adds Evie who is also a producer-instructor with “Stories Found”. It was Simpson, as founder of SF and his colleague James Martin who sifted through the applicants’ ideas and made the final picks.\nExplaining that every applicant had to pitch a story idea as well as send in their academic credentials, Evie says two of those ideas became the basic for making two film shorts entitled Zumari and Shoto. Both recently premiered at the Oxford Film Festival. “It was Oxford in America, not Oxford UK,” she adds.\nThey have both been screened elsewhere in the States. Shoto is currently up for a “Best New Media” award at the 2019 Best of NFML— New Filmmakers Los Angeles awards.\nThe initial idea which led to the making of Shoto is attributed to Firul Maithya and Arnold Mvoi. Zumari is also a moving story about a young street boy whose life is transformed once he gets his hands on a flute. His ‘zumari’ (Kiswahili for flute) became his “passport” out of the slums, Evie adds.\nThe former Kenyan TV presenter has been working with Simpson since 2016 when she helped him make the 45 minute documentary, ’A voice 4 peace’ about the Korogocho-based “Ghetto Classics” choir.\nThe film was funded by the US Embassy in Kenya, which also assisted the “Stories Found” project."

The reception was excellent and I was absolutely delighted with that.\n\"What I wanted it to be was an even better day, and an even better day would have been for us to get a result that I think, on the balance of play as the away team, we probably deserved.\""

        "text": "In this age defined by the presidency of Donald J. Trump, our nation is increasingly divided and our political atmosphere highly charged. The contentious environment contributes to other societal problems, even as it makes it increasingly difficult to deal with them. America’s schools are not immune from this division and incivility and are similarly challenged to address a range of issues that confront our society.\nThat is the start of a new report titled “School and Society in the Age of Trump\" that looks at how school principals are dealing with — and how students are affected by — social issues that have been prominent during the Trump presidency: 1. political division and hostility; 2. disputes over truth, facts and the reliability of sources; 3. opioid addiction; 4. the threat of immigration enforcement; and 5. the threats of gun violence on school campuses.\nThe report, written by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles’s Institute for Democracy, Education and Access, details findings from a nationally representative poll taken of hundreds of high school principals. And it includes recommendations for school leaders to consider.\nThis post about the findings was written by Mike Rose, a highly respected research professor in the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies.\nSchools are porous institutions — what happens in society at large plays out in classrooms and hallways — so the disturbing findings of a masterful new report “School and Society in the Age of Trump” should not surprise. But they do, in their scope and severity.\n* Almost all principals rate the threat of gun violence as a major concern, and one in three principals report that their school received in the previous year threats of mass shooting or bombing or both.\nThere’s more: In schools with a sizable immigrant population, principals report the significant negative effects that federal immigration policy and its associated anti-immigrant rhetoric have on student performance and family stability.\nAnd schools that are in the areas of the country hardest hit by the opioid crisis are directly affected by addiction, overdose, and family devastation.\nThese extraordinary challenges interact and are cumulative. Over 90 percent of principals report confronting at least three of the problems I just listed: incivility, false information, threats of gun violence, anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric, and the opioid crisis. This is the world of the American high school today.\nRogers and his colleagues provide a rich analysis of the survey data and contextualize it with relevant research on political climate, gun violence, etc. But what makes the report come poignantly alive are the many comments offered by the principals themselves.\nThere’s a greater divide than there has been in years past between liberals and conservatives—which I think everybody sees. Things that are going on outside the school setting obviously affect school, and students’ thoughts, and students’ beliefs. There’s a different tone. I don’t want you to think that the sky is falling. As society goes, school goes. So [a] breakdown in communication [and] civility in general society, plays itself out in a school setting, or it has opportunity to.\nWe had a group of students wearing the Confederate flag to the school on a regular basis, and our school is predominantly white with a small group of African American and Hispanic students. This wearing [of] the Confederate flag had a deep impact on those [students] of color. [Our] response was twofold: [First], ensure to the students that were offended by this that it was not a representation of our school culture—it was a representation of a few people’s opinion—and that they were safe within our school. [Second], help the others that were expressing their first amendment rights to [recognize] the fact that, sometimes, your beliefs can have a negative impact on others.\nYou need to be sensitive to other people’s opinions and perspectives. This group of kids that has been displaying and wearing the Confederate flag has pretty entrenched values. It’s going to be an ongoing challenge for our school. It has not risen to the level of violence yet but I feel it percolating and I’m hoping that our conversations back and forth between the groups of kids on both sides can keep it from getting violent.\n1. Establish and communicate school climate standards emphasizing care, connectedness, and civility and then create practices that enable educational systems to document and report on conditions associated with these standards.\n3. Develop integrated systems of health, mental health, and social welfare support for students and their families.\n4. Create and support networks of educators committed to fostering care, connectedness, and strong civility in their public education systems.\n“School and Society in the Age of Trump” offers a compelling and thought-provoking composite portrait of the American high school principal that becomes as well a portrait of our country at the end of the second decade of the 21st Century.\nYou can download both a summary and the full report here."

The eye will help his skull develop properly, since he's still a toddler.\nBut he's taken the ordeal in his stride, returning to his usual playful, adventurous mood as soon as he stepped foot onto their Sun Valley home back patio.\n\"He's actually perfect.... He's exceptional,\" Lara said."

        "text": "A rumour about the spread of French “yellow vest” protests to other European countries went viral on Chinese social media before Christmas.\nThe story emerged after French president Emmanuel Macron announced a number of concessions to address protesters’ grievances over economic policies. While Macron expected calm and order be restored, the Chinese-fabricated rumor predicted the opposite.\nMultiple versions of the story were spread via a number of micro-blogging accounts on Weibo and Wechat, quoting sources from a commodity wholesaler in Yiwu—a city well known as a wholesaling center—who stated that their entire stock of yellow vests in stock was sold out and more orders had been coming in from European nations such as Sweden, Prague, Switzerland, etc. The story implied that the “yellow vest” protests were spreading throughout the continent.\n[Yiwu Index] Yiwu’s research report on clothing showed that orders of “yellow vests” from Europe has continued to surge. Manufacturers worked overtime to meet the demand and many traders from overseas e-commerce platforms see the movement as an excellent sales opportunity. Chinese netizens believed that based on the Yiwu commodity index and its big data, the yellow vest movement would spread to Sweden, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Spain. Foreign media outlets pointed out that the Yiwu Index could accurately predict international political trends. Commodity orders from overseas market could serve as indicators of public opinion and hence could accurately predict the results of political events. Back in 2016, based on the orders of election related t-shirts and flags, manufacturers from Yiwu had predicted Donald Trump would win the U.S. presidency five months in advance. Observers say that textile factories in Yiwu have started receiving orders from the U.S and have begun manufacturing flags and T-shirts for Trump supporters for the 2020 presidential election. The demand is now several times larger than orders from supporters of the Democratic Party. Some have started to predict that Trump would be re-elected. This shows the power of China’s big data.\nLocated in Zhejiang Province, Yiwu is the world's biggest small commodities trading hub, and one of the most popular small commodities wholesale markets in China. Yiwu's international trade city has an Index called the Yiwu China commodity index that reflects market trends.\nDuring the US election in 2016, the Yiwu Index became a hot topic on Chinese social media, as discussions about election-related merchandise order records in Yiwu seemed to indicate that Donald Trump was more popular than Hillary Clinton. After the election, even state-affiliated media reported that commodity order records from Yiwu and Alibaba had predictive power, and many Chinese netizens believed that the Yiwu Index was more accurate than the US election polls. Some media observers were quick to point out that this interpretation was problematic, as Clinton, in fact, received more votes than Trump, but this analysis was ignored.\nThis time, state-affiliated media outlet Global Times fact-checked the online story and reported that yellow vests were not out of stock in the trading city and that the sales volume in recent months was not higher than last year's. The Global Times report, however, has done nothing to stop the spread of the Yiwu Index myth. In fact, new commentary emerged after the Christmas reasserting the predictive power of Yiwu Index. The story, republished on various online media platforms, did acknowledge the erroneous sales figures for yellow vests, but continued to insist that the Yiwu Index had successfully predicted the results of both the 2016 U.S presidential election and the 2018 World Cup.\nThe reason Yiwu can “accurately predict” the trend of global affairs, again and again, is due to the Yiwu people’s contributions in the past few decades. They have walked a distinctive path in the world’s commodity markets and established the city’s leading status as the manufacturing hub of world’s daily necessities. Open door and reform policy has helped numerous cities like Yiwu to take courageous steps and strike out for success. Their efforts have brought about the great transformation of China in just 40 years.\nThis intertwining of the predictive power of the Yiwu Index with China's economic transformation has made the myth even more difficult to debunk."

Rafal said these innovations include the expansion of the e-Blotter System, which was started by the Butuan City Police Office; the implementation of the e-Warrant System, where the warrants of arrest will be placed in a data base system so that an apprehended person’s record can be easily accessed whether he has other standing warrants; and the e-Rouge System, for the convenient access of a suspect’s background information, criminal records and other of his profiles.\nOther innovations, Rafal said, will be announced to the public in the coming days. He also said that other anti-criminality projects which had worked well in other parts of the country may be replicated here in the region.\nThese may include the creation of “Motorcycle Cops” to counter the “Motorcycle-riding-in-tandem” criminals, enhancing the Police Community Relations, information campaign, police visibility patrols on the streets and emphasis on the capability of the police to conduct search and rescue and relief and rehabilitation operations. Director Rafal said that per instruction from CPNP PDGen. Bartolome, the police mobile forces such as the Regional Public Safety Battalions and the City and Provincial Public Safety Companies, will conduct not only internal security operations but also disaster management operations.\nThe director said that they will also continue with their existing campaign to arrest the wanted persons, the realization of the policeman-per-barangay and other on-going projects.\nRafal commended the regional police force for a job well done in 2011, as crime volume decreased by 19.1 percent, compared to the previous year. He said that the reduction of the crime rate nationwide had also been noted by the police higher headquarters. He added the figures in the region went down even in November and December last year, when the crime volume was expected to rise due to the holiday season."

        "text": "A paper, \" The Economics of Network Neutrality\", by Economics Professor Benjamin Hermalin of the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, and co-authored by Nicholas Economides of New York University’s Stern School of Business, examines the proposition that a tiered Internet (i.e. where service providers pay to have their data transported across the network faster) finds that it would actually slow down the overall delivery speed!\nEssentially, the authors conclude that paid-for acceleration of the delivery speed of selected content leads to additional congestion because consumers will purchase more of the content that is preferentially delivered and the increased consumption will increase network congestion.\nHere's the paper's abstract: \"Pricing of Internet access has been characterized by two properties: Parties are directly billed only by the Internet service provider (isp) through which they connect to the Internet and the isp charges them on the basis of the amount of information transmitted rather than its content. These properties define a regime known as “network neutrality.” In 2005, some large isps proposed that application and content providers directly pay them additional fees for accessing the isps’ residential clients, as well as differential fees for prioritizing certain content. We analyze the private and social incentives to introduce such fees when the network is congested and more traffic implies delays. We find that network neutrality is welfare superior to bandwidth subdivision (granting or selling priority service). We also consider the welfare properties of the various regimes that have been proposed as alternatives to network neutrality. In particular, we show that the benefit of a zero-price “slow lane” is a function of the bandwidth the regulator mandates be allocated it. Extending the analysis to consider isps’ incentives to invest in more bandwidth, we show that, under general conditions, their incentives are greatest when they can price discriminate; this investment incentive offsets to some degree the allocative distortion created by the introduction of price discrimination. A priori, it is ambiguous whether the offset is sufficient to justify departing from network neutrality.\" -- \" The Economics of Network Neutrality\", by Nicholas Economides and Benjamin E.

Her company, founded in 1997, currently performs various characters in history and develops literacy programs at schools, colleges, military bases, churches or where ever needed.\nBefore the audience at the Wagon Wheel Theater, Waddy-Thibodeaux transformed herself from a 20th century CEO into the legendary Harriet Tubman and relayed the story of the Underground Railroad, while delivering a message on the importance of literacy.

On Wednesday night, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed that cyber experts from the State Department recently hacked into websites used by Al Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate and swapped out propaganda that bragged about killing Americans. “Within 48 hours, our team plastered the same sites with altered versions of the ads that showed the toll Al Qaeda attacks have taken on the Yemeni people,” Clinton said at the Special Command gala dinner in Tampa, Florida.\nThis is the clearest evidence we’ve seen that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups want to attack the cyber systems of our critical infrastructure … Congress needs to act now to protect the American public from a possible devastating attack on our electric grid, water delivery systems or financial networks, for example.\nThe fact is that Al Qaeda engages in tactics and ideologies that are by their nature exceptionally divisive and controversial. Highlighting that does a tremendous amount of damage to Al Qaeda’s image, to its recruitment campaigns and its effort to launch renewed attacks.\nHe also questioned the effectiveness of the digital war on terror, noting, “If you’re already living in Yemen and in a tribal area, you probably don’t need to go to a Web site to join al-Qaeda.” Yet Clinton insisted that the State Department’s online efforts are making a difference in Yemen, the country that was the origin of two attempted underwear bombings and a campaign to mail explosives disguised as printer cartridges to Chicago-area synagogues. “We can tell our efforts are starting to have an impact” said Clinton, “because extremists are publicly venting their frustration and asking supporters not to believe everything they read on the Internet.” Well done, State Department.

She’s not a Huey Newton.\nNow, as I point out, she was not suspended for calling Trump a white supremacist. I don’t think ESPN Disney thought that reflected negatively on them, but this they think does. And this is about money. This is not about principle. What she did is go out and basically tell people to boycott her company! You can’t separate the Dallas Cowboys from ESPN. Sponsors of the Dallas Cowboys are by inference and extension sponsors of the National Football League and thus sponsors of ESPN, and she’s asking people to boycott those sponsors in protest to Jerry Jones.\nHave you heard the latest? I don’t have a name. I just saw the link at a quick glance at the computer screen. But somebody now — I think it’s ESPN. I don’t know. Somebody’s comparing Jerry Jones to a modern-day slave owner. That this is slave oppression behavior. And of course it isn’t. African-American players in the National Football League have no greater fan and no greater supporter than Jerry Jones.\nJerry Jones idolizes his players. (interruption) Oh, the rapper Common, the actor, the rapper Common. He’s an angry guy too. He’s mad all the time. All these people are mad all the time. They’ll see Trump threaten to beat Tillerson in an IQ test, and it’ll ruin their day, they’re so mad. Jerry Jones idolizes his players. That’s one of the reasons, by the way, people have often criticized Jerry for being the general manager of the team.\nGeneral manager runs the draft, essentially picks the roster, and people have said he’s too close to it. He needs to hire a general manager with a little bit more objectivity. The reason is he idolizes these guys. There’s no owner in the NFL who has more respect and appreciation for every player in the NFL, especially his own and including the African-American players who make up 75%, on average, of every NFL roster. These allegations are just absurd.\nBut I predicted this. I hate to remind you. When this concussion stuff started is when I predicted this. I said, “Wait ’til these people trying to damage this game figure out that they can make the slave owner connection based on the racial component.” The stories were developing that the game kills people, that the game ruins the brains of players and leads them to commit suicide and die much earlier than average people that don’t play the game, which, by the way, is true.\nAnd I said you wait until some of these leftist critics figure out that they can claim that it’s nothing more than modern-day slavery. Who is it that’s killing themselves for the entertainment of the white owners sitting safely away in the skyboxes above, never subjecting themselves to any of these injuries but delighting in the injuries they witness, their own employees. And now it’s starting to happen. Not in conjunction with concussions, but in conjunction with all the rest of this, the NFL ownership is now becoming the equivalent of modern-day slave owners.\nAnd the never ending formula once again is repeated, that viewers have openly said they’re tired of and wish wasn’t happening as part of the time they expend watching this game, looking for it to provide them an escape from the very kind of thing now being rammed down their throats when they watch it.\nNow, back to the New Black Pantherette, Jemele Hill. I think a lot of these people literally do not understand the financial arrangements that result in the National Football League existing and a team existing and how it’s owned, operated, makes a profit. I don’t think because education, economic education so woefully inept, that to them all this is funding and donors and funders are everywhere, but now we need to boycott them because things are going socially wrong in our league.\nAnd she doesn’t understand — or maybe she does; I don’t know — that calling for a boycott of sponsors is actually asking for damage to occur to the place she works! And I don’t think she has a grievance with ESPN, or she didn’t before she was suspended. Her grievance was with the slave owners of the NFL and the president, the white supremacist in the White House. But I don’t think she had a particular grievance. Maybe she does. People like this have a grievance about practically everything, including their Kellogg’s Corn Flakes in the morning. So you never know."

His IT organization has been winning awards for technology innovation since the early 2000s, and Richardville has received CIO of the Year awards from the Charlotte CIO Leadership Association, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).\nHow does Richardville and his team manage to drive innovation in an industry that has been a relative laggard in adopting new technologies?\nA case in point: When Richardville received his electric bill from Duke Energy, he saw the bill gave advice on how to lower his family’s electricity costs. He talked with Duke’s CIO about the systems and processes behind that product and introduced the same capability to Carolinas HealthCare System.\nLikewise, Richardville is currently in talks with the CIO of a pillow manufacturer about how Internet of Things (IoT) technologies might allow both companies to innovate.\nWhile “connected pillows” are only in the early discussion phase, Richardville and his team have plenty of innovative projects in development.\nPatients can use Alexa to learn wait times at Carolinas HealthCare System’s nearest urgent care centers and then reserve their spot in line.\n“Our goal is that patients will be able to use voice for any online services they are currently using, whether that’s scheduling appointments or paying bills,” says Richardville.\nHow did the IT team at Carolinas Healthcare System get the voice initiative going?\nRichardville says there are several new leadership skills, such as innovation and lean thinking, that should not be siloed departments, but rather weaved into the fabric of core business leadership.\n“Innovation does not belong to one group here. We’ve integrated innovation into everything we do. By creating an innovative culture, we’ve been able to leverage technology for patient care and experience for decades,” he says.\nBy creating an innovative culture, we’ve been able to leverage technology for patient care and experience for decades.\"\nFor example, six years ago, members of Richardville’s team read a short article in an issue of Popular Mechanics about palm scanning technology that Japanese high-tech companies were developing for use in ATM machines.\n“We thought we could use the same technology to do a better job of recognizing people when they walk into our facilities,” he says. So, the IT team called Fujitsu, the company developing the technology, and struck a deal. “Healthcare is the biggest market for this technology now,” Richardville says.\nThe key to building an innovative culture is being laser focused on it, he adds..\nFor Richardville, the most exciting opportunities for innovation on the horizon in healthcare are around self-service.\nCraig Richardville is senior vice president and chief information and analytics officer at Carolinas HealthCare System.

Citizens should expect to see the crews out from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and sometimes a bit earlier or later depending on the situation, officials said.\nThe autonomous robots resemble a skinny miniaturized tank with an orange tread that helps move it to and fro inside the sewer collection pipes.\nThe robots offered by Redzone Robotics of Pittsburgh, Penn. are a first-of-its-kind innovation for the sewer industry. The video camera footage of each pipe will be archived, and WASA employees will be able to pan the camera to look at different angles from the same viewpoint.\nBut the big upshot from robots is that the Peachtree City Water and Sewer Authority will end up with an inspection of all its collection pipes in the system. Typically that would take about 15 years, but the robots will get the work done in 15 months.\nWASA officials will use the data gathered during the inspection to plan its future capital projects and identify where system rehabilitation is necessary. All data, including the video, will be available offline so no Internet connection is required, officials said.\nThe cost of going with Redzone Robotics is $178,256 a year for seven years at zero percent interest. That is comparable to what WASA has been spending annually for the much smaller scale manual video inspections, officials have said."

Doha denies the accusation.\nThe ISIS threatened attacks in Saudi Arabia after the terror group claimed responsibility for assaults in Tehran that killed at least 17 people, Site Intelligence monitoring group reported on Friday.\nSuicide bombers and gunmen attacked the Iranian parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in Tehran on Wednesday. Scores of people were also wounded.\nISIS claimed responsibility and threatened more attacks against Iran's majority Shia population, seen by the hardline terrorists as heretics.\nIn a video that appeared to have been recorded before the attack on Tehran, five masked fighters were shown threatening Shia in Iran as well as the Saudi Arabian government saying their turn \"will come\".\n\"Allah permitting, this brigade will be the first of jihad in Iran, and we ask our brothers the Muslims to follow us, as the fire that was ignited will not be put out, Allah permitting,\" one of the masked terrorists said, according to SITE.\nAt the end of the video, he sent a message to the Saudi government.\n\"Know that after Iran, your turn will come.

        "text": "A Turkish newspaper reported on Thursday CIA director Gina Haspel signaled to Turkish officials last month that the agency had a recording of a call in which Saudi Arabia’s crown prince gave instructions to “silence” Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nThere are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about this report, though such a thing is certainly possible. Nobody from the White House, the CIA, the Saudi government or even the Turkish government is offering a comment on it. (Of course, the fact that nobody is denying it either might fuel some suspicions.) The columnist who published the article, Abdulkadir Selvi, offers generalities, repeatedly writing “it is being said…” without mentioning who was doing the talking. And if we were actually listening to the Crown Prince’s phone calls, do you think the head of the CIA would confirm that to Turkey?\nAlso worth noting is the fact that the newspaper is hardly independent. It’s only in operation because it’s a mouthpiece for Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He’s not only antagonistic toward Saudi Arabia but is rather peeved at Washington these days over our refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen. It’s not unreasonable to suspect that Turkey might plant a story like this just to cause more mischief between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThis entire story is already so strange that we can’t rule out anything at this point. But for the time being, I’ll wait until we at least get some sort of confirmation from one of the key players before we take this as fact."

DeBrusk’s second of the night (13th of the season) made it 5-3 with 6:14 to play; Marchand’s second (15th this season) found an empty net with less than two minutes to play.\nJaroslav Halak made 33 saves for the B’s, who were outshot, 37-27.\nAlthough coach Bruce Cassidy said in the morning that the Bruins’ habit of surrendering shorthanded goals (eight; tied for last in the NHL entering the game) had been a topic of discussion, they didn’t get the message. A two-man advantage covering 1:55, with another minor penalty tacked on, somehow turned into a 1-0 deficit at 7:46.\nMichael Frolik, caught tripping David Krejci at 5:39, stepped out of the box with teammate Elias Lindholm (double minor, high sticking, 5:44) still inside, followed teammate Mark Jankowski on a shorthanded rush and scored on a rebound when Jaroslav Halak mishandled Jankowski’s playable shot from the left circle. It was the Flames’ league-leading 13th shorthanded goal.\nThe Bruins, who brought the NHL’s fourth-best power play into the game, at least managed to answer during Lindholm’s penalty, when second unit defenseman John Moore beat Mike Smith to the far side from the right circle at 9:02. The B’s took their first lead with 5:41 left in the period when Krejci, who missed the morning skate to be with his wife as she delivered a baby boy, snapped a shot from near the point that Jake DeBrusk tipped through Smith from the slot for his 12th goal of the season.\nThe Bruins still had a one-goal lead by the end of the second, despite allowing an early goal and spending more than six minutes killing penalties.\nCalgary’s Johnny Gaudreau, who was denied by Halak on a first-period breakaway, got his second of the game near the one-minute mark. Halak trapped it on the goal line with his right skate blade, but the play wasn’t blown dead and Lindholm jammed it across the goal line at 1:05. The 2-2 tie lasted just 36 seconds, though: Torey Krug spotted Marchand coming out from behind the Flames’ net to Smith’s left, and hit him with a perfect slap-pass that Marchand steered home at 1:41 for his 14th goal of the season.\nThe B’s weren’t able to add to the lead, however, because they took four straight penalties before the Flames were assessed another. The biggest challenge came when, 1:18 into dealing with DeBrusk’s high-sticking minor, the Bruins were caught with too many men on the ice, leaving them at a 3-on-5 disadvantage for 42 seconds. Zdeno Chara, defense partner Brandon Carlo and Patrice Bergeron killed that off, and the B’s were in the process of killing a Marchand minor when Lindholm interfered with Sean Kuraly at center ice with just seven seconds left in the second. That became a third-period power play during which David Pastrnak made it 4-2 after just 54 seconds."

His office said the dead included nine children and three women.\nMinister of Border and Tribal Affairs Asadullah Khalid said a U.S. soldier had burst into three homes near his base in the middle of the night, killing a total of 16 people including 11 people in the first house.\nThe ISAF spokesman said the U.S. soldier “walked back to the base and turned himself into U.S. forces this morning,” adding there had been no military operations taking place in the area when the incident occurred.\nPanjwayi district is about 35 km (22 miles) west of the provincial capital Kandahar city. The district is considered the spiritual home of the Taliban and has been a hive of insurgent activity in recent years.\n“I saw that all 11 of my relatives were killed, including my children and grandchildren,” said a weeping Haji Samad, who said he had left his home a day earlier.\n“They (Americans) poured chemicals over their dead bodies and burned them,” Samad told Reuters at the scene.\n“They were all drunk and shooting all over the place,” said neighbor Agha Lala, who visited one of the homes where killings took place.\nThe Afghan Taliban said it would take revenge for the deaths, in an emailed statement to media.\nISAF Commander General John Allen promised a rapid investigation.\nCivilian casualties have been a major source of friction between Karzai’s Western-backed government and U.S.-led NATO forces in Afghanistan. NATO is preparing to hand over all security responsibilities to Afghans and all foreign combat troops are scheduled to leave by end-2014.\nNATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the alliance remained firmly committed to its mission and said anyone responsible would be held accountable.\nThe Koran burning and the violence that followed, including a spate of deadly attacks against U.S. soldiers, underscored the challenges that the West faces as it prepares to withdraw.\nSunday’s attack may harden a growing consensus in Washington that, despite a troop surge, a war bill exceeding $500 billion over 10-1/2 years and almost 2,000 U.S. lives lost, prospects are dimming for what the United States can accomplish in Afghanistan.\n“These killings only serve to reinforce the mindset that the whole war is broken and that there’s little we can do about it beyond trying to cut our losses and leave,” said Joshua Foust, a security expert with the American Security Project."

The Guardian has reported that the UK authorities repeatedly threatened the newspaper’s management with legal action and led to it being forced to destroy information it had received from the US whistleblower Edward Snowden. This information is about unlawful surveillance by the US and the UK governments which violates their citizens’ and other people’s right to privacy.“Insisting that the Guardian destroy information received from a whistleblower is a sinister turn of events,” said Tawanda Hondora, Deputy Director of Law and Policy at Amnesty International. “This is an example of the government trying to undermine press freedoms. It also seriously undermines the right of the public to know what governments do with their personal and private information. If confirmed, these actions expose the UK’s hypocrisy as it pushes for freedom of expression overseas.“The UK government must explain its actions and publicly affirm its commitment to the rule of law, freedom of expression and the independence of the media. They should initiate an inquiry into who ordered this action against the Guardian.” “Using strong-arm tactics to try to silence media outlets and reports that divulge information relating to Prism and other surveillance efforts, is clearly against the public interest.\" The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger on Monday published allegations about the UK authorities’ actions over the past several months to pressure the newspaper to hand over or destroy evidence related to the government surveillance."

        "text": "A Federal Police member flashes a victory sign during a battle with ISIS militants in the Mansour district of Mosul, Iraq, March 12, 2017.\nMOSUL, Iraq, (Reuters) - Iraqi government forces killed the Islamic State commander of Mosul's Old City on Tuesday as the battle for the militants' last stronghold in Iraq focused on a bridge crossing the Tigris river.\nAs fighting intensified on Tuesday after the previous day's heavy rains, civilians streamed out of western neighborhoods recaptured by the government, cold and hungry but relieved to be free of the militants' grip.\nIS snipers were slowing the advance of Interior Ministry Rapid Response units on the Iron Bridge linking western and eastern Mosul but the elite forces were still inching forward, officers said.\nGovernment forces also pushed into areas of western Mosul, Islamic State's last redoubt in the city that has been the de facto capital of their self-declared caliphate.\nFederal police killed the military commander of the Old City, Abu Abdul Rahman al-Ansary, during operations to clear Bab al-Tob district, a federal police officer said. With many IS leaders having already retreated from Mosul, Ansary's death comes as blow to the militants as they defend their shrinking area of control street-by-street and house-by-house.\nCapturing the Iron Bridge would mean Iraqi forces hold three of the five bridges in Mosul that span the Tigris, all of which have been damaged by the militants and U.S.-led air strikes. The southernmost two have already been retaken.\n\"We are still moving toward the Iron Bridge. We are taking out snipers hiding in the surrounding building, we are still pushing for the Iron Bridge,\" Brigadier General Mahdi Abbas Abdullah of the Rapid Response force told Reuters.\nNear the Mosul Museum, Iraq forces used armored vehicles and tanks to attack snipers pinning down troops clearing areas around the bridge.\nAn air strike targeting one Islamic State position hit a building, engulfing nearby troops in smoke and dust.\nSince starting the offensive in October, Iraqi forces with U.S.-led coalition support have retaken eastern Mosul and about 30 percent of the west from the militants, who are outnumbered but fiercely defending their last stronghold in Iraq.\nFor much of Tuesday, the troops were within 100m (330 feet) of the bridge.\n\"It's very key for our forces to secure the riverside and prevent Daesh militants from turning around our advancing forces,\" a Rapid Response spokesman said in the morning, using an Arab acronym for Islamic State.\nThey expected to gain control of the Iron Bridge and the nearby area by the end of the day, he said.\n\"Seizing the bridge will help further tighten the noose around Daesh fighters entrenched inside the old city,\" he said.\nThe boom of shelling and heavy machinegun fire could be heard from the center of Mosul and helicopter gunships strafed the ground from above on Tuesday morning.\nAmid the combat, a steady stream of refugees trudged out of the western districts, carrying suitcases, bottles of water and other possessions. Some pushed children and sick elderly relatives in handcarts and wheelbarrows.\nSoldiers packed them into trucks on the Mosul-Baghdad highway to be taken to processing areas. Most left in the dark early morning hours or after the army recaptured their neighborhoods. Food had been scarce, they said.\n\"We fled at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT) after the army had arrived. There has been a lot of shelling by Daesh,\" said Hamid Hadi, a teacher. \"Mostly we've been eating water mixed with tomatoes.\"\nAshraf Ali, a nurse who escaped with his wife and two children, said mortar rounds were falling as they fled. They took advantage of the army retaking their district to get out.\n\"Daesh wanted us to move to their areas but we escaped when the army arrived,\" he said.\nAs many as 600,000 civilians are caught with the militants inside Mosul, which Iraqi forces have effectively sealed off from the remaining territory that Islamic State controls in Iraq and Syria. The Iraqi forces include army, special forces, Kurdish peshmerga and Shi'ite militias.\nMore than 200,000 Mosul residents have been displaced since the start of the campaign in October. The Ministry of Immigration and Displacement said on Tuesday that in recent days, almost 13,000 displaced people from western Mosul had been received seeking assistance and temporary accommodation each day.\n\"Whenever we advance there are more people coming out,\" said one Iraqi officer directing refugee transport. \"There are more people on this side of the city and people are trying to leave because there is no food and no supplies in their area.\"\nLosing Mosul would be a major strike against Islamic State. It is by far the largest city the militants have held since their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed himself leader of a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria from a mosque in Mosul in the summer of 2014."

        "text": "I’m anxious. I wish that I could take a reprieve from politics and simply focus on the human suffering and human altruism on display in the affected areas. But, alas, I cannot. Politics keep creeping in. Politics keep occurring concurrently.\nConsider what this man is saying: He used the horror and anxious anticipation of a monster storm menacing millions of Americans – particularly in Houston whose population is 44 percent Hispanic – in a political calculation to get more ratings and more eyeballs on the fact that he was using the power of the presidency to forgive, and thereby condone, Arpaio’s racism.\nWhy does Trump continue to do things that are so divisive and alienating to the majority of Americans? Why does he keep fueling the white-hot fire of his base to the exclusion of the other segments of the country?\nI have a theory: Trump and the people who either shield or support him are locked in a relationship of reciprocation, like a ball of snakes. Everyone is using everyone else.\nEstablishment Republicans see him as a path to reversing the New Deal.\nSteve Bannon-ists see him as a path to the “deconstruction of the administrative state.” All Republicans, but particularly the religious right, see him as a securer of conservative Supreme Court justices. The blue-collar Trump voters view him as a last chance to breathe life into the dying dream that waning industries and government-supported white cultural assurances can be revived. And the white nationalists, white supremacists, racists and Nazis – to the degree that they can be separated from the others – see him as a tool of vengeance and as an instrument of their defense.\nTrump sees all these people who want to use him, and he’s using them right back. Trump made an industry out of selling conspicuous consumption. He sold the ideas that greed was good, luxury was aspirational and indulgence was innocent.\nTrump’s supporters see him as vector; he sees them as market.\nMarketing is how he has made his money and attained his infamy. That is why he is so obsessed with the media and crowds and polls (at least when he was doing well in them): He sees people, in his die-hard base at least, who have thoroughly bought into the product of Trumpism and he is doing everything to please them and make them repeat customers.\nBut in addition, and perhaps more sinisterly, I think that Trump is raising an army, whether or not he would describe it as such, and whether or not those being involved recognize their own conscription. This is not a traditional army, but it is an army no less.\nAnd, when I say army, I’m not speaking solely of armed militia, although there is a staggering number of guns continuously being put into circulation. As the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action wrote in June: “Each month of Trump’s presidency has seen over two million firearm-related background checks. Only in 2016, when Americans faced losing their Second Amendment rights forever, did the FBI run more checks during a January to April period.” I’m also talking about the unarmed, but unwavering: the army of zombie zealots.\nHow do you raise an army?\nYou do that by dividing America into tribes and, as “president,” aligning yourself with the most extreme tribe, all the while promoting militarization among people who support you.\nYou do it by worshipping military figures and talking in militaristic terms.\nYou cozy up to police unions and encourage police brutality.\nYou do this by defending armed white nationalists and Nazis in Charlottesville.\nYou do this by pardoning Arpaio, a man who joked about an Arizona jail being a “concentration camp,” signaling to people that racist brutality is permissible.\nYou also do this by attempting to reduce or marginalize populations of people opposed to you: Build a wall, return to failed drug policies that helped fuel mass incarceration, ban Muslims, curb even legal immigration, increase immigration arrests.\nAnd why raise this army? Again, I have a theory.\nShould something emerge from the Robert Mueller investigation – an investigation that is continuing unabated even as Harvey rages – that should implicate Trump and pose a threat to the continuation of his tenure, Trump wants to position any attempt to remove him as a political coup. His efforts to delegitimize the press are all part of this because one day the press may have to deliver ruinous news.\nIn that scenario, Trump knows that the oligarchs and establishment Republicans would be quick to abandon him. Their support isn’t intrinsic; it’s transactional. But the base – the market – the ones with guns as well as those who are simply excited, the die-hards, the ones he keeps appealing to and applauding, will not forsake him. They see attacks on Trump as attacks on themselves.\nTrump is playing an endgame. In the best-case scenario, these die-hards are future customers; in the worst, they are future confederates.\nIf these people should come to believe – as Trump would have them believe – that establishment systems have unfairly and conspiratorially acted to remove from office their last and only champion – another thing Trump would have them believe – what will they do?\nWhat would Trump’s army do if he were compelled to leave but refused to graciously comply?"

He and John Adams are the only Presidents whose son was also elected to the nation’s highest office. He didn’t win re-election but may go down in history as one of the greatest one-term presidents.\nIn just 48 months, President Bush’s biggest accomplishments were leading the peaceful end to the Cold War with the Soviet Union, quietly leading the efforts for a reunified Germany, and defeating Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War.\nAnd while many critics say going back on his promise of no new taxes and the independent candidate Ross Perot cost him re-election in 1992, many don’t remember that difficult decision led to a balanced budget and the beginning of lower interest rates.\nMaybe the most impressive part of his legacy is President Bush never looked for credit. He was known for kindness and a good heart. He instructed the Secret Service to turn off sirens and ordered his motorcade to come to a halt at stoplights. He would join the Secret Service in searching for midnight snacks in the White House kitchen. He sent thousands of hand-written thank you notes.\nPresident Bush often and publicly told his family he loved them.\nThat love for family has ties to Charleston.

        "text": "Lieutenant Colonel George Washington Goethals saw the Panama Canal to its completion. From 1907 to 1914 he successfully oversaw the project that for almost 25 years had consumed millions of dollars and thousands of lives. He was called \"the Genius of the Panama Canal.\" But Goethals felt unworthy of this title, saying that his predecessor, John F. Stevens, truly deserved it.\nJohn Stevens was appointed chief engineer of the Panama Canal Project in 1905 based on his accomplishments -- some might call them feats -- at James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway. The fearless Maine native helped Hill carry out his plan to expand his American rail lines west, and thus contribute to the white settlement of the Pacific Northwest.\nNative Americans had long described a traversable gap in the Rockies that white explorers had not yet found. In December 1889, aided by a Flathead Indian guide, Stevens walked the Marias Pass in Montana -- in 40-below weather, no less. What Lewis and Clark and countless others had tried, Stevens accomplished. The Marias Pass, the lowest crossing of the Rocky Mountains, allowed the Great Northern to expand through the Rockies without a tunnel. The following year, Stevens conquered another pass - now called the Stevens Pass -- in Washington's Cascade Mountains.\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt knew Stevens was the right man -- perhaps the only man -- to tackle the catastrophic Panama Canal Project. The Canal's \"affairs [were] in a devil of a mess,\" TR said. The French had begun work on the canal in 1883 lacking experience in Panama's jungle terrain, and also lacking a blueprint. Unskilled excavation led to deadly landslides; outbreaks of malaria and yellow fever took hundreds of lives a week; and effort and money were wasted when railroad track was laid that didn't fit the gauges of the existing railroad. When the project changed hands, American workers didn't fare much better.\nEnter John Stevens. The foremost civil engineer of his day, Stevens stepped in when his predecessor abruptly quit, and he approached the project as a humanitarian effort, as well as an engineering one. With confidence and morale desperately low among the workers, one of Stevens' first actions was to introduce a food car, a haven of entertainment and much-needed sustenance for the men.\nIn addition, Stevens parted company with most high-ranking officials by taking seriously the threat of yellow fever-carrying mosquitoes, and he insisted that workers be immunized against yellow fever (it was impossible, unfortunately, to immunize against malaria). The last case of yellow fever was reported on November 11, 1905, shortly after Stevens' arrival.\nHis workers' welfare on the mend, Stevens drew up logical plans for the canal's construction. One of the first things he did was to call on 27-year-old Ralph Budd, a gifted manager who would go on to develop streamliner trains at the Burlington Railroad. Stevens had supervised Budd at the Rock Island Railroad in Kansas City, and he recruited him for the difficult job of building a railroad across the Panamanian isthmus. Engineering advances, including Stevens' successful push to build a loch system instead of a sea-level canal, were coupled with social ones. Like his Great Northern boss, Stevens built transportation infrastructure and new communities side by side.\nLacking the advanced degrees of many of his colleagues, Stevens shunned any special treatment as an officer. The living quarters reserved for him -- palatial by camp standards -- remained empty as he bunked nearer to the workers. Straight-talking and cigar-chomping (a habit that earned him the nickname \"Big Smoke\"), he and politics didn't mix well. Signing on in 1905 \"until he could predict success or failure according to his own judgment,\" Stevens resigned in 1907, the plans for further construction in place.\nAfter Panama, Stevens returned to the railroads, both at home and abroad. In 1917 he led Woodrow Wilson's American Advisory Committee of Railway Experts to Russia, designed to assist Russia's provisional government in improving the Trans-Siberian and Chinese Eastern Railways; and in 1919 he became president of the Inter-Allied Technical Board in Manchuria.\nStevens retired in 1923, but for 20 years, until his death at age 90, he constantly received accolades for his contributions to engineering. Despite numerous honors, nothing ever compared to his send-off from the in-progress Panama Canal in 1907. One historian noted: \"It was as if the people were honoring a man who had already built the Panama Canal.\""

        "text": "Kevin Hunter has been fired as an executive producer on his estranged wife Wendy Williams' show, as the $215K Ferrari he bought for his baby mama is towed away, DailyMail.com can reveal.\nWilliams decided she finally had enough of her philandering husband of nearly 22 years and served him divorce papers at her TV studio in Manhattan last Thursday.\nThe 47-year-old was fired from the show and as Wendy's manager, a source on the show confirmed to DailyMail.com.\nThe source also said Hunter had been given 48 hours to remove his belongings from their marital home in Livingston, New Jersey as she was seen apartment hunting in New York City on Tuesday.\nWendy reached her tipping point after learning Hunter had been living the high life with his decade-long mistress Sharina Hudson, who gave birth last month, splurging on Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and gifting her with diamonds.\nHunter released an apology on Tuesday admitting he was not'proud of his recent actions' and was'trying to right some wrongs' while taking'full accountability' for what he had done.\nHis groveling statement came after the flashy $215,000-plus gold Ferrari Portofino he gifted Hudson was seen being towed away - a day after Wendy hit him with the divorce papers.\nThe source said:'Kevin had expected to stay on at the show and as Wendy's manager. He ran the show with an iron fist, he was the guy who kept the vultures away.\n'But when Wendy saw the photos of him and Sharina last week on the Daily Mail going out for dinner and her driving around in a Ferrari she was furious.\n'That's what tipped her over the edge, she was like, \"he's gotta go\". She now wants him out of her life completely, she's given him 48 hours to clear his office and clear his belongings out of the house.\nA day after DailyMail.com published photos of the new Ferrari that Hunter gifted Hudson, it was loaded onto a truck and taken away.\nA Ferrari dealership from Greenwich, Connecticut, picked the golden car up, as two men who appear to be helpers for Hunter looked on.\nHunter's statement on Tuesday read:'28 years ago I met an amazing woman: Wendy Williams. At the time, I didn't realize that she would not only become my wife, but would also change the face of entertainment and the world.\n'I have dedicated most of our lives to the business empire that is Wendy Williams Hunter, a person that I truly love and respect unconditionally.\nI am not proud of my recent actions and take full accountability and apologize to my wife, my family and her amazing fans. I am going through a time of self-reflection and am trying to right some wrongs.\n'No matter what the outcome is or what the future holds, we are still The Hunter Family and I will continue to work with and fully support my wife in this business and through any and all obstacles she may face living her new life of sobriety, while I also work on mine.\nOn Monday, Wendy kicked off her Hot Topics segment by revealing she was just a few days away from moving out the sober living facility she has called home for the past few weeks, and is ready to start a new life for herself and her son Kevin Jr. - the son she shares with Hunter.\nDailyMail.com exclusively revealed in early March the TV host had been living in the sober home in Queens, New York, to battle an addiction to alcohol and prescription pills, her downward spiral sparked by learning Hunter was still seeing Hudson.\nMeanwhile, Hunter has been spending time with Hudson, who recently gave birth, at a hideaway in Edgewater, New Jersey.\nThe two seem to be living the high life, going out for dinner dates and driving new luxury vehicles.\nHunter was seen driving a new maroon convertible Rolls-Royce last Saturday to pick up Hudson and take her out to dinner, with the massage therapist proudly showing off her post baby pooch.\nThe 33-year-old, whose hair was freshly curled, carried a $5,200 quilted Chanel purse while wearing a chunky diamond chain necklace and diamond studs.\nWhile Hunter treated his baby mama to a Ferrari, he seems to have also treated himself to new cars, including the luxury Rolls-Royce.\nHudson was seen driving her new sports car last Monday, exiting the flashy vehicle in a $1,260 Thom Browne tracksuit that showed off her post-baby body.\nAnd Kevin has spared no expense on his own duds as well, seen one day in a $1,500 Fendi vest, $490 Fendi hat, $770 Fendi pants and $515 Fendi sunglasses.\nThe couple have been hiding out in New Jersey weeks after Hudson was secreted away to Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia to give birth in order to avoid media attention.\nHunter has been seen at the secret hideaway chauffeuring Sharina around.\nKevin was served with divorce papers from Wendy last Thursday morning at the TV studio, according to TMZ.\nExtra security was hired in case Kevin, known to have a temper, got enraged on set. But there were apparently no outbursts.\nThe split will most likely be contested as Hunter is an executive producer on Williams' TV show and told Hudson that he couldn't afford to split from Wendy because she paid all the bills, a source previously told DailyMailTV.\nIn New Jersey, parties can file fault or no-fault. Fault allows a judge to dock alimony based on the seriousness of the offense. Proving will not be hard for either side in this case.\nReasons for fault include adultery, abandonment, physical or emotional abuse, and alcohol or drug abuse.\nWilliams filing for divorce comes after DailyMailTV revealed she had been living in a sober living home in Queens, New York, being treated for addiction to booze and prescription drugs.\nHer downward spiral was sparked in December after she learned Hunter was still seeing Hudson, his mistress of more than a decade.\nMeanwhile, Williams seemed to be in good spirits on her morning show on Thursday.\nA source previously told DailyMailTV that Wendy was keeping her ring on during filming until she worked out what to do with Hunter, but was taking it off once outside of the studio.\nA recently resurfaced excerpt from Williams' memoir reveals that she vowed to leave her husband if another woman had his child.\nWendy wrote in her 2001 memoir it would be one of the only things that would make her part ways from Hunter once and for all after revealing he'd already cheated on her earlier on in their relationship.\nWilliams' marital problems are the root of cause of her addiction to booze and pills, kicking off last December when the star hired a private investigator to spy on Hunter who she suspected was still carrying on with Hudson, DailyMailTV revealed last month.\nIn 2017, Hudson had been at the center of a DailyMail.com investigation that exposed her ten-year affair with Williams' husband.\nAfter being told the secret affair was still very much alive, the TV host confronted Hunter demanding to know why he was still seeing the 33-year-old qualified massage therapist.\nDuring the heated clash, it's believed Williams fell and hit her shoulder on the ground, suffering a hairline fracture.\nDevastated, Williams quickly plunged into a depression while recovering from the injury and began drinking heavily. During the time away from hosting her show, Williams' drinking - coupled with powerful pain medication - proved a potent cocktail. Williams, who has a history of drug addiction, became hooked.\nAfter returning from rehab in Florida, Williams began living in a sober home in Queens, which is situated above a barbershop in an unassuming red brick building in Long Island City.\nBut when news broke that Hudson had given birth to a little girl in late March, she checked herself out of her sober living home and started drinking - eventually being found by her team who took her to the hospital to sober up.\nIt's understood the star's sober coach, who had been with her 24 hours a day, raised the alarm.\nA studio source told DailyMail.com:'She was in a bad way and disappeared from the studio after her show Monday.\n'She went back to the sober house only to check herself out and decided to start drinking.\nThey continued:'Word got back to the studio and there was panic and concern, everyone was looking for her, no one knew whether there would be a show today.\nAlthough Hudson has made several ultimatums to Hunter, insisting he leave Williams so they can settle down and start a family together, Hunter told her he can't leave Wendy because she paid all the bills.\n'Kevin is in love with Sharina but he told her he can't leave his wife, but the only reason he is still with Wendy is because he and Sharina can't take care of themselves - they need her money,' a source told DailyMailTV."

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Suspected Chinese abuses in the region of Xinjiang should be addressed through engagement with the government, the new EU ambassador to China said on Friday, a contrast to the position of U.S. officials who are considering sanctions.\nReports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of Muslim ethnic Uighur people in the far western region have sparked a growing international outcry.\nA U.N. rights panel said last month it had received credible reports that up to a million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention, and called for them to be freed.\nChinese authorities have also set up thousands of police checkpoints across the region, and human rights advocates have decried martial law conditions and mass DNA collection.\nThe new EU ambassador, Nicolas Chapuis, who took up his posting this week, told reporters the European Union had been taking note of reports on abuses in Xinjiang, and had raised the issue with China, but it needed facts.\n“The union’s stance is that we are working in the United Nations framework,” Chapuis said.\n“We believe in dialogue. We believe in engagement, and first of all, we need the facts,” he said, without elaborating.\nHundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in recent years in unrest between members of the Uighur minority who call the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.\nBeijing says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists. Officials deny mistreating Muslims there, instead saying they are putting some people through “vocational” style courses to prevent militancy spreading.\nU.S. Assistant Secretary of State Manisha Singh told a congressional hearing on Thursday that Washington was weighing sanctions against Chinese senior officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses there.\nBut Chapuis said the European Union must engage with China if it wanted to be more than a “soft power”.\n“The strengthening of the EU-China relationship would show how the union would grow as a full power, not only as a soft power,” he said.\nChapuis added that there was an “urgency” to strengthen EU-China relations in the context of the “triangulation” between the United States, China and the European Union.\nOn the subject of global trade, he said it was normal for major trading partners to have some commercial friction, echoing a line used by Chinese officials to play down disputes.\nAmid an escalating U.S.-China trade war, Beijing has put pressure on the EU to stand with it against U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies, though the world’s largest trade bloc has largely rebuffed those efforts, and broadly agrees with the U.S. assessment of unfair Chinese trade practices.\nNonetheless, Chinese state media has promoted the message that the EU is on China’s side, and some European officials have expressed concern that China is seeking to capitalize on divisions between Trump and U.S. allies in Europe."

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (AP) � As Mexico struggled against the odds yesterday to contain a new flu that has killed as many as 68 and perhaps sickened more than 1,000, it was becoming clearer that the government hasn�t moved quickly enough to head off what the World Health Organization said has the potential to become a global epidemic.\nFlu pandemics occur whenever a new strain of the virus arises to which most people have no natural immunity. Experts believe they have been occurring since at least the 16th century. In the 20th century, there were three flu pandemics. Global health officials are watching the swine flu outbreaks to see whether they might spark the next one.\n? 1918. The Spanish flu pandemic that started in 1918 was possibly the deadliest outbreak of all time. It was first identified in the United States but became known as the Spanish flu because it received more media attention in Spain than in other countries, which were censoring the press during World War I. The 1918 flu struck mostly healthy young adults. Experts estimate it killed 40 to 50 million people worldwide.\n? 1957. The 1957 pandemic was known as the Asian flu and was first identified in China. There were two waves of illness during this pandemic; the first wave mostly hit children while the second mostly affected the elderly. It caused about 2 million deaths globally.\n? 1968. The most recent pandemic, known as the Hong Kong flu, was the mildest of the three pandemics this century. It was first spotted in Hong Kong in 1968, and it spread globally over the next two years. The people most susceptible to the virus were the elderly. About 1 million people are estimated to have been killed by this pandemic.\nThe World Health Organization said the outbreak has become a �public health emergency of international concern� and asked countries around the world to step up reporting and surveillance of the disease and implement a coordinated response to contain it.\nBut Mexicans were dying for weeks at least before U.S. scientists identified the strain � a combination of swine, bird and human influenza to which people might have no immunity. Now, even controlling passengers at airports and bus stations might not keep it from spreading, epidemiologists say.\nThe disease already has reached Texas, California and Kansas, and 24 new suspected cases were reported yesterday in Mexico City alone, where authorities suspended schools and all public events until further notice. More than 500 concerts, sporting events and other gatherings were canceled in the metropolis of 20 million.\nThe Mexican government issued a decree authorizing President Felipe Calderon to invoke special powers letting the Department of Health isolate patients and inspect homes, travelers and baggage.\nOfficials said the decree gives clear legal authority to health department workers who might otherwise face reprisals.\nHealth workers and soldiers joined a broad effort at airports and bus stations to keep people with disease from traveling though or out of the city. But with confirmed swine flu cases in at least six states � and possibly as many as 14 � the efforts seemed unlikely to stop the spread of the disease.\nAt Mexico City�s international airport, health workers passed out questionnaires seeking to identify passengers with flu symptoms. Surgical masks and brochures were handed out at bus and subway stations. The U.S. embassy in Mexico posted a message advising U.S. citizens to avoid large crowds, shaking hands, greeting people with a kiss or using the subway."

        "text": "In 1890, a group of eight large New York City bakeries combined to form the New York Biscuit Company and built a giant six-story factory in West Chelsea. Eight years later, they merged with their competitor, Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing to form an even larger conglomerate – the National Biscuit Company, but the factory and headquarters remained in Chelsea. In 1901, the National Biscuit Company put their abbreviated company name on a box of wafers for the first time – Nabisco. Soon, Nabisco became the company's official name.\nOn April 2, 1912, the National Biscuit Company announced to their sales team that they were introducing three \"highest class biscuits,\" in a grouping they called the \"Trio.\" Two of the cookies, the Mother Goose Biscuit and Veronese Biscuit, didn't sell particularly well and quickly disappeared from the shelves. The third, the Oreo Biscuit, did. \"Two beautifully embossed chocolate-flavored wafers with a rich cream filling,\" the Oreo Biscuit was sold in a yellow tin with a glass cover for approximately 30 cents a pound (about $7.13 today). While it went national in April, it was just a month before that the National Biscuit Company first registered the product with the US Patent and Trademark Office (registration number 0093009). It is commonly stated the given date of registration was March 6th, which is why that is National Oreo Day. However, a simple patent and trademark search reveals that oft-repeated date is incorrect. In fact, it was actually filed on March 14, 1912 and registered on August 12, 1913.\nSo how did they come up with the idea of the Oreo? By using the time-honored business practice of stealing the idea from a competitor and then marketing it better than the original. You see, there was another popular creme-filled sandwich cookie that came before the Oreo, made by Sunshine Biscuits. Sunshine Biscuits was a company run by Joseph and Jacob Loose and John H. Wiles, the former of which were originally part of the great bakery conglomeration of 1898 (the one that formed into the National Biscuit Company).\nIn any event, in 1908, four years before the Oreo, Sunshine debuted the upscale, and soon to be very popular, Hydrox biscuit, which the Oreo was a pretty blatant rip-off of, cream filling, embossing and all. Of course, Nabisco denies this is where the idea for the Oreo came from, but the evidence at hand strongly indicates otherwise.\nAs for the name, there has never been a firm answer for why the National Biscuit Company chose \"Oreo,\" though there are several theories. There is speculation that \"Oreo\" is derived from the French word for gold – \"or,\" since the original packing was gold and the item was meant to be a \"high-class\" confectionery. It could also come from the Greek word for mountain or mound – \"oros,\" since an Oreo is a \"mountain\" of a cookie. It has also been speculated that maybe it was named for the cookie itself, two \"O\" shape cookies sandwiching the cream, O-cream-O.\nThe identity of the designer behind the distinctive emboss on top of each cookie – or what the emboss signifies – has also become part of the Oreo mystery. The first design was simple enough – with the name \"Oreo\" and a wreath at the edge. In 1924, the company augmented the original design to go with a 1921 name tweak – from \"Oreo Biscuit\" to \"Oreo Sandwich.\" The 1924 design added a ring of laurels and two turtledoves. Twenty years later, in 1952, is when today's elaborate, beautiful, design first appeared.\nBut what does the design signify, if anything? Historians believe the circle that encases the word \"oreo\" with antenna-type symbol on top was an early European symbol for quality. Cookie conspiracists believe that the antenna symbol is actually a Cross of Lorraine, a symbol identified with the famed Knights Templar. The \"four-leaf clovers\" that surround the name could be just that or it could be the cross pattee – a geometric pattern of four triangles radiating outwards that is also associated with the Knights Templar and the Freemasons. It's up to the individual what they want to believe, but this author thinks the Oreo cookie is a delicious Da Vinci Code style map leading to a treasure buried a thousand years ago… Or as I like to call it, the probable plot to National Treasure 3.\nNow, who designed the emboss? Evidence points to William Turnier. However, while Nabisco admits that a man by the name of William Turnier worked for them for fifty years, they deny that he developed the 1954 design. That said, his son and drawn proof indicate otherwise. Turnier joined the company in 1923, working in the mail room. He eventually worked his way up to the engineering department, helping make the dies that made the cookies, the industrial-sized cookie cutters as it were.\nSo where's the evidence? In the home of Bill Turnier, William's son, perched on a wall is a framed 1952, line drawn blueprint of the modern Oreo design. (If you're curious, Why Blueprints are Blue) Underneath the blueprint, it is written \"Drawn by W.A.Turnier 7-17-52,\" two years before the design would find itself on the Oreos sold in stores. Despite this evidence, the Kraft (who now owns Nabisco) Corporate Archives only says that Turnier was a \"design engineer\" and he received a Suggestion Award in 1972 for an idea \"that increased the production of Nilla Wafers on company machinery by 13 percent.\" So can Bill shed any light on what his father was thinking when he seems to have drawn the design? Not really, though he did admit that the design, while beautiful and resembling more mysterious symbols, probably had nothing to do with the Knights Templar. His father wasn't a Mason either.\nAs for the stuff between the intricately-designed cookies, the filling- it was made partially of lard – pig fat – until 1997. In 1994, Nabisco embarked on a nearly three year revamping process of the filling to take the lard out. In charge of this was Nabisco's principal scientist Sam Porcello, otherwise known as \"Mr. Oreo.\" By that point, Porcello was already a cookie legend, holding five Oreo related patents, including Oreos encased in white and dark chocolate. By December 1997, the Oreo cookie was lard-free, but there was another problem – the lard had been replaced by partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; yes, the very much not good for you trans fats. As the Chicago Tribune put it, \"Later, research showed that trans fat was even worse for the heart than lard.\" Finally, in January 2006, healthier (and more expensive) non-hydrogenated vegetable oil was put into Oreos instead. Today's filing is additionally made with loads of sugar and vanilla extract creating a cookie that still is delicious, but slightly better for you. Or, perhaps more aptly, less bad for you.\nBill also says that his father created or tweaked other well-know Nabisco designs in his half century with the company, including tweaks on the Nutter-Butter, the Ritz Cracker, and a dog's favorite treat, the Milkbone.\nThe basic Oreo cookie is 71 percent cookie, 29 percent cream filling.\nThis post has been republished with permission from TodayIFoundOut.com.

        "text": "One of the first things teachers tell new writers is to sit down in the same place at the same time every day to write. It’s the ritual, a way of preparing to write that primes our minds and our bodies to do it. The repetitive steps of sitting down in our writing spot awakens our minds to the process ahead.\nRituals — from how we stir cream into coffee and blow out birthday candles to wedding vows and funeral prayers — influence how we experience these moments of our lives.\nA ritual can be any set of actions and procedures, usually more than one and often repeated, that are performed in a meaningful or ceremonial way. The process can prompt people to feel a sense of control and calm, according to researchers, and may also boost our enjoyment of the moment.\nPsychologist Kathleen Vohs found that the simple act of lighting birthday candles and singing happy birthday can improve the taste of birthday cake and enhance our enjoyment of food. In one of her experiments the participants were given a chocolate bar. One group was asked to relax and then eat the bar at any time. The other was given a set of detailed instructions to follow before eating the candy.\nThe group that went through the specific chocolate-eating routine actually enjoyed eating the candy more than the other group. The key, according to researchers, is in the deliberate participation of the task. Random movements didn’t add to the joy and spectators didn’t benefit by watching the ritual.\nRituals cause us to savor and connect to our experiences. “They draw us in,” according to Vohs in the study published in the journal Psychological Science.\nI use rituals daily to draw me into my day and help me sustain a positive mindset. After a short morning ritual I feel greater clarity and calm. This sets the tone for the day. My routine is short and simple because I’m a slow starter and I need the morning to be simple.\nThen, I move into my gratitude list. Each morning I give thanks for three things. I mention different things each day and this keeps me looking for the good stuff throughout the day. With each item I say “thank you” and pause to let the feeling sink in.\nI intend to act with kindness and compassion.\nI intend to experience peace and calm today.\nI intend to focus my attention on writing today.\nThis kind of intention becomes like a soundtrack for the day, something that brings my awareness back to what it is I want to experience. I find that when I’m acting with these good intentions, good things often follow as well. This three-step ritual of awakening, gratitude, and intention has proven a powerful way to create a successful day.\nNorton, M.I., Gino, F. (2014).

        "text": "Someone with adverse childhood experiences whose abuse and mental health problems weren’t properly considered by the courts should not be executed.\nChildren are our future; what happens while they are young has life-long consequences. I recently retired after 45 years advocating in Tennessee for improving outcomes for children and families. The last several years focused on preventing adverse childhood experiences – ACEs – and mitigating their impact on children, families and society.\nResearch on ACEs demonstrates childhood adversity leads to trauma and toxic stress that damage the developing brain. This can cause developmental damage, violence, substance abuse, and physical and mental health challenges.\nGov. Bill Haslam and other state leaders launched Building Strong Brains Tennessee, an effort to establish Tennessee as a national model promoting culture change to prevent and mitigate ACEs and their impact, and to enhance long-term prosperity by improving outcomes for children.\nThe original ACEs study identified 10 types of childhood trauma. Five are personal: physical, verbal or sexual abuse, and physical or emotional neglect. Five are caused by family dysfunction: parental substance abuse, mental illness, incarceration, domestic violence and the absence/loss of a parent.\nEach experience of trauma counts as one ACE. So, if before age 18, a child experiences physical abuse and a father in jail, his ACE score is two. Higher scores increase risk for poor mental and physical health outcomes (depression, addiction, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and psychosocial outcomes (incarceration, job failure, lower education).\nIndividuals who become violent often have experienced substantial trauma and have high ACE scores. ACEs are facts, not fate, so safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments can reduce damage from significant childhood stressors.\nDavid Miller has been on Tennessee’s death row nearly 37 years and is scheduled for execution Dec. 6. As a child, David experienced chronic physical, sexual and emotional trauma, giving him an irregularly high ACE score. His biological father and mother both had mental illness; his mother sexually abused him for years. David’s stepfather beat him regularly, sometimes to unconsciousness.\nDavid repeatedly fled the abuse only to be returned home, where the beatings and sexual abuse continued. Later, he was sent to a boys’ school, another experience marked by rampant abuse and assaults. At age 14, David began experiencing seizures and episodes of losing contact with reality, attributable to his severe, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. This condition led to the crime for which he was sentenced to death.\nDavid was dating Lee Standifer in Knoxville when she was murdered. According to court documents, he had significant memory lapses that night and couldn’t explain what happened. He did not dispute that he had killed Ms. Standifer, but only remembered hitting her with his fists.\nIn his 1982 trial, the law did not allow a defense expert as it does today, so no expert testified about David’s diminished mental health. The law had changed by his resentencing in 1987, but his attorney failed to call an expert to testify about his brain damage and psychosis, factors juries often find warrant a sentence of life in prison instead of the death penalty.\nThough lay witnesses shared his history of abuse in his resentencing in 1987, Tennessee’s death penalty statute failed to let the jury weigh this as mitigation, a defect in Tennessee law since addressed. Today, jurors can consider any facts supporting a life sentence over a death sentence.\nSomeone with a life-long history of ACEs whose abuse and mental health problems weren’t properly considered by the courts should not be executed. David Miller’s traumatic experiences should have been mitigating factors and would be if he were tried today.\nAs we continue advocating for children today, we must also stand up for those who have been extensively victimized since childhood. In cases like David’s, execution is not the answer.\nLinda O'Neal is a retired child advocate."

        "text": "(Newser) – A national poll showed Donald Trump slightly ahead of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, though, as Nate Silver points out at FiveThirtyEight, cherry-picking polls isn't necessarily indicative of an overall trend: Per the FiveThirtyEight model that analyzed a whole slew of surveys, Clinton appears to still be in the lead by about 3 or 4 percentage points nationwide—a slicing in half of the lead she enjoyed in mid-October. But it's the Electoral College numbers that have Silver declaring Trump as \"no longer really a long shot,\" though he remains the \"underdog.\" In the site's polls-only model, Trump has a 30% chance (as of this posting) of emerging the electoral vote victor, or 31% if you go by the polls-plus model, which includes economic and historical data. And Silver notes even though some are skeptical Trump can nab the needed 270 electoral votes, there are ways in which he could win.\nIf Hillary can win the election, then maybe Anthony Wiener still has a shot at being mayor of New York!!\nCrazy stuff, America. That a person like Trump has a significant shot at the Oval Office, then God save us all.\nThe electoral college renders democrat voters in red states meaningless. The same thing is true for republican voters in blues states. Voting for President is a waste of time when only a handful of states ultimately determine the election. In these states voter fraud is a major contributor to the process, which will affect DJT more than HRC. It's the electoral college that screwed AlGore and it needs to be reworked to make the process meaningful to legal voters."

        "text": "Current and former intelligence officials say it is standard practice to suspend a clearance pending the outcome of an investigation. Yet in the case of Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s former chief of staff at the State Department, two letters indicate this practice is not being followed — even as the Clinton email system remains the subject of an FBI investigation.\nA second letter dated Feb. 18, 2016, from the State Department’s assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Julia Frifield, provided additional details to Grassley about the “administrative error.” It, too, confirmed Mills maintained the top secret clearance.\nHillary tasked Mills with researching through government records more than two years ago, long before the existence of the e-mail server became known. Mills had left State when Hillary did, about eleven months prior to this designation, but her clearances would not necessarily have been closed out with her departure. One might think that her access to certain programs would and should have been curtailed — especially the “special access programs” that ended up in the Hillary e-mail system. Those are so closely held that they’re more eyes-only than Top Secret.\nDan Maguire, a former strategic planner with Africom who has 46 years combined service, told Fox News his current and former colleagues are deeply concerned a double standard is at play.\nThe other interpretation here may be that the State Department isn’t going to budge in its defense of their operation during the Clinton years. They have almost entirely argued that the issues in the classified-information spillage have more to do with disputes over the necessity of classifying the data at all — although they backed off from that when the SAP data was found, deciding that even a redacted version of the e-mails was too dangerous for release in 29 cases. State might be keeping Mills’ clearance in place to give the impression that there’s nothing to see here, and people should just move along.\nIt’s also possible — although it seems unlikely — that the FBI has told them that Mills won’t be a target in the probe. That would be curious, to say the least, since the FBI does not rule out potential targets until the investigation concludes. Any way one cuts it, though, this is a very odd development under the circumstances, and Grassley should start asking for some explanations.\nMinutes before the new set of emails was posted on the State Department website Friday, the House Select Committee on Benghazi announced that the agency just handed over more than 1,600 additional pages of Libya-related records — a disclosure that comes about four months after Clinton took the stand to testify.\nIn a court filing earlier this month, State said officials originally overlooked the records because they didn’t realize some of the documents had been “retired” to State archives, but Benghazi Committee Republicans took it as what they’ve called ongoing stonewalling from the administration. “The administration still has not turned over records this committee requested nearly a year ago,” the GOP-controlled panel tweeted.\nIt’s interesting that State buried that release with the final tranche of Hillary’s e-mails, eh? In October, Hillary and the White House both argued that the select committee was just a rehash of other investigations, but State keeps somehow finding material they’ve never released before on the subject. That seems like the same pattern of denial that State used for FOIA demands during and after Hillary’s tenure as Secretary of State, does it not?"

        "text": "Three tell-tale signs that it's spring in Baltimore: The birds come back to town -- both the little chirping kind that hang out in the trees and the kind that hang out at Camden Yards.\nDaffodils and tulips push their way up to the earth's surface, unfold in a glorious pageant of color -- then freeze and die from a late, freak cold snap.\nAnd the Johns Hopkins University holds its annual spring fair.\nFor 27 years, Hopkins has opened up its Homewood campus to the people of Baltimore, offering three days of fun and entertainment, and almost all of it for free. This Friday, Saturday and Sunday you can enjoy live music, arts and crafts, an antique car show, plenty of kiddie rides and games and a few fun, oddball attractions like sumo wrestling. The theme of this year's event is \"Odyssey,\" which will incorporate a little bit of Ancient Greece into the fair. So fairgoers can also participate in the Greco-Roman challenge sporting events or try some gladiator jousting.\nThe fair is entirely organized and run by Hopkins undergraduate students and is billed as the largest student-run festival in the country. \"We expect 150,000 people to come to the fair over all three days,\" said sophomore Katie Rieder, publicity co-chair for the event. \"For me, it's going to be so awesome to see so many people come to our campus and enjoy themselves. We have all been working hard on getting this together in between everything else like studying and classes.\"\n\"The main reason we do this is because we want to give something back to Baltimore,\" said Larry Liang, a senior at Hopkins who is in charge of booking musical entertainment for this year's fair. \"This is our way to thank the whole community.\"\nAlthough the spirit of the fair has not changed in 27 years, the music has changed a little this year, Liang said. \"It's not all college, alternative pop music,\" he said. \"I'm pretty excited about the musical lineup this year.\"\nThis year, music lovers can still hear local rock bands in the 98 Rock Beer Garden, but they can also hear swing bands, steel drum bands, ska music, blues performers and DJs spinning trip-hop sounds.\nFor newcomers to the fair, such as D.C.-based ska band Checkered Cabs, it's a great opportunity for new people to hear their music.\n\"We're more of a club band, but we attract a college-aged crowd,\" said Sean Hissey, drummer for the band. \"Ska has a reputation of being this underground thing, but in reality, ska has been around since the'50s. It has generations and waves. It was in, out, came back and left, now it's back again and will hopefully stay around.\"\nFor bands like Mambo Combo, who have performed at the fair more times than they can remember, the spring event is sort of a homecoming, especially for guitarist and keyboardist Bob Friedman, who graduated from Hopkins in 1969 with a degree in psychology.\n\"They keep asking us to come back every year,\" Friedman said. \"We're a fun group, and people like to dance to us.\" The group's Sunday afternoon performance outside of Shriver Hall will be a welcome change for the band, Friedman saaid. \"We've been in smoky clubs all winter, this will be our first chance to play outside..... We're looking forward to it.\"\nBut the biggest musical act to come to the fair this year is national recording group Letters to Cleo, who kick off the fair a little bit early with a show tonight at 8 p.m. in Shriver Hall. Tickets are $10 and are available by calling TicketMaster at 410-481-SEAT. Some tickets may be available at the door if the show is not sold out.\nMost know the band from its debut album, \"Aurora Gory Alice,\" and the song \"Here and Now,\" which was played over and over on the closing credits of the TV show \"Melrose Place\" during the Billy loves Allison era.\nThe exposure was great for the band, but it was sort of a double-edged sword, said Kay Hanley, lead singer of the Boston-based quintet. \"If it wasn't for that, I'd probably still be waiting tables.... but I have ruined any chance of having any indie credit.\"\nThe band never set out to be on \"Melrose Place,\" but when it signed with its record label, the group asked to be on a compilation album of songs for the show. \"We were like Track 9, right after Dinosaur Jr. I thought it was very cool.\"\nWhile on tour, the band found out that its song was being played over the credits to the show. \"I thought it was kick,\" Hanley said. But later, the group was criticized for supposedly orchestrating a huge self-promotion. \"I assure you we went into the whole thing very innocently..... It's really upsetting to be constantly defending your motives.\"\nWhile some people haven't heard from the band since \"Here and Now,\" Letters to Cleo has stayed very busy. The group released a second album after \"Aurora Gory Alice\" and has been \"touring constantly,\" Hanley said. \"We toured for like three years straight..... We all got burned out. I didn't have a creative cell in my brain.\"\nEveryone in the group decided to take time off to relax. \"I did absolutely nothing,\" Hanley said. Well, she did get married and witnessed her sister give birth, a \"totally amazing experience,\" Hanley said. After the break, the group was \"fresh as daisies\" to get back to work and record their third album, \"Go!\", which was released in October.\nNow it's back to touring.\n\"We're doing colleges all this month,\" Hanley said. \"This is the time of year when you can do them; they're fun, and it pays a lot of bills.\"\nAlthough \"Go!\" has had mostly good reviews by critics and, according to Hanley, has \"some of the best songs\" she has ever written, the album has not had much airplay outside of their local area.\n\"The album is dead,\" Hanley said.\nNo matter to Letters to Cleo. The band will keep on making music, Hanley said. \"A band like ours doesn't always fit on the radio..... Putting out albums and touring is a way of generating a fan base for us.\"\nAs for the future, expect a fourth album next fall and some Lilith Fair tour dates this summer, Hanley said. \"Whatever we do as a band, we do purely for ourselves.\"\nWhere: Johns Hopkins University Homewood Campus, 3400 N. Charles St.\nTickets: Free for parking and most events. Letters to Cleo performance at 8 p.m. today in Shriver Hall costs $10, $8 for Hopkins students.

        "text": "The hijacking of an EgyptAir aircraft to Cyprus recalls a previous era when hijackings were a regular occurrence.\nTuesday's hijacking of an Egyptair aircraft on a domestic flight from Alexandria to Cairo took the world by surprise in part because, particularly since the September 11th attacks in the United States in 2001, security on passenger flights around the world has been substantially increased.\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a large number of hijackings carried out by Palestinian terrorist groups. El Al Israel Airlines quickly developed a reputation for its stringent airline safety. The first and last successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place in 1968.\nOn July 23, 1968, El Al flight 426, en route from Rome to Tel Aviv, was hijacked and flown to Algeria. Originally scheduled to depart Rome on the afternoon of July 22, engine problems delayed the flight's departure and in the end, there were only 38 passengers on board – seven of them El Al employees or their family members – in addition to a crew of 10. Shortly after takeoff, two of the three hijackers burst into the cockpit with guns. The hijackers were members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which had been founded in 1967 by George Habash.\nThe plane landed in Algiers, Algeria, where the aircraft and its passengers became captives of Algerian officials, starting a more than month-long ordeal for many of the passengers and crew. The 23 non-Israeli passengers were released first. On July 27, the 10 remaining women, passengers, crew, as well as three children, were set free. But the remaining 12 Israeli men (seven crew and five passengers, two of them airline employees) remained prisoners of the Algerian government until September 1, more than 40 days later. They were released following an international aviation boycott of Algeria and the release by Israel of 16 Palestinian prisoners.\nOne set of hijackings that captured particular attention around the world was the plot by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine to commandeer five planes, four bound for New York and one for London. On September 6, the hijackers, who demanded the release of Palestinians in Israeli jails, managed to take control of three planes and force them to land at Dawson's Field, a remote former British airstrip in Jordan. The planes were operated by TWA, Swissair and BOAC, the predecessor to British Airways. A fourth plane, a Pan Am aircraft, was flown to Cairo and blown up after the passengers disembarked.\nThe fifth aircraft was an El Al flight from Tel Aviv to New York with a stop in Amsterdam. The two hijackers, a Nicaraguan American man and a Palestinian woman, Leila Khaled, attempted to take over the plane after it took off from Amsterdam. The El Al pilot refused to accede to the demands of the hijackers. The male hijacker was shot by an onboard sky marshal and later died of his injuries while Khaled was overpowered. The plane landed at Heathrow airport in London.\nNorman Shanks, a former director of airport security at Heathrow, told the New York Times that following the coordinated series of hijackings, the international aviation community took action to prevent hijackings.\nA flight operated by the Belgian airlines Sabena from Vienna to Tel Aviv and piloted by a British-Jewish pilot, Reginald Levy, was taken over by four members of the Palestinian Black September movement. At their direction, Levy landed the plane at Lod airport near Tel Aviv, now known as Ben-Gurion International Airport. The hijackers reportedly separated Jewish from non-Jewish passengers, and when the aircraft landed demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel or the plane would be blown up.\nThe following day, a commando team from the IDF's elite Sayeret Matkal unit approached the aircraft disguised as aviation technicians. They killed the two male hijackers and captured the two female hijackers. In an exchange of gunfire, a woman passenger was hit and later died of her wounds. The commando raid was commanded by Ehud Barak, who was later to become prime minister of Israel. One of the other commandos, who was wounded in the operation, was Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's current prime minister.\nThe Entebbe hijacking saga began on June 27, 1976, when two members of the Popular Front for Palestine and two from Germany's Baader-Meinhof Gang, hijacked an Air France plane on a flight from Tel Aviv to Paris, with a stop in Athens, to Entebbe airport in Uganda. It arrived in Uganda the next day after a stop in Libya. The hijackers boarded the plane in Athens. They were joined by reinforcements in Uganda and the Ugandan dictator at the time, Idi Amin, expressed support for the hijacking.\nOn July 1, some of the passengers were released but about 100 remained, including all the Israelis and the members of the crew. The hijackers set a deadline by which their demands, the release of prisoners in Israel and elsewhere, would be met or they would kill the passengers. The hijackers' plans were foiled early on July 4, when a daring Israeli commando team that had landed at the airport rescued most of the passengers.\nThe commando unit commander, Yonatan Netanyahu, the brother of Israel's current prime minister, was killed in the operation, as were three hostages and all of the hijackers. A fourth passenger, Dora Bloch, who had been removed from the airport and taken to a Ugandan hospital prior to the rescue mission, was reportedly shot and killed by Ugandan forces."

        "text": "(JTA) — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos visited two yeshiva high schools in New York this week, amid allegations that such schools fail to provide an appropriate secular education.\n“Secretary DeVos made these historic visits to better understand Jewish education, a unique and time-honored tradition, within the diversity of the American educational tapestry,” said Rabbi Abba Cohen of the ultra-Orthodox organization Agudath Israel of America, which pressed for the visits.\n“In these schools, she saw commitment, innovation, inclusion, and values. Hopefully, also, the Secretary has gained a greater appreciation of why Jewish education means nothing less than ‘continuity and survival’ to us… and why we sacrifice so much to provide it to our children.” Cohen said Thursday in an email to JTA.\nDeVos visited the Manhattan School for Girls on Tuesday and on Wednesday visited Yeshiva Darchei Torah, a preschool through high school yeshiva for boys.\nThe secretary’s visit comes as New York City’s Department of Edcuation investigates whether Hasidic schools provide an adequate secular education to their students. The investigation was launched in response to allegations by former students of such schools that the city and state failed them and that they were not prepared for life or employment in the outside world.\nThe two schools that DeVos visited do have tracks that prepare students for higher education. Their students also take the state Regents exam, which measures their readiness for higher education, but critics say they are not typical of many yeshivas.\nThe New York State budget approved last month included a provision that eases oversight of nonpublic schools, allowing haredi, or ultra-Orthodox yeshivas leeway in complying with state law requiring private schools to offer students instruction that is “at least substantially equivalent” to that offered in public schools. State Sen. Simcha Felder, a Democrat who represents several haredi neighborhoods in Brooklyn, had threatened to withhold key support for the budget without the provision.\nThe New York Times reported that enrollment in Orthodox Jewish schools in New York is steadily rising. There were at least 52,000 children enrolled in Hasidic schools in New York City in 2013, the newspaper reported, citing figures from the Avi Chai Foundation, and 28,500 in other yeshiva day schools.\nDeVos has not yet visited a New York public school, and was criticized by the city’s Department of Education for skipping public schools on this trip."

        "text": "As Airbnb adds more features to court business users, a smaller startup has raised some funding to challenge it in the $18 billion business travel market. 2nd Address, an Airbnb-style platform for business travellers looking for home rentals that extend beyond 30 days — as an alternative to staying in hotels — is announcing funding of $10 million from GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Foundation Capital, along with Amicus and Pierre Lamond.\nThe startup says it will be investing the money to improve its technology as well as expand to more cities. Its current footprint covers the Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago and Washington, DC — where it claims that a property on its platform typically comes in about 40 percent cheaper on a per-night basis compared to a business or extended stay hotel — and the plan is to extend that to 17 more markets in 2019.\nScale will be the name of the game for the startup, which today works with just 650 hosts covering some 3,200 listings.\nCustomers that have already signed on as users include the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Google, SAP, Deloitte, KLM and Stanford and Northwestern University.\n2nd Address has raised $42 million to date, with a portion of that dating back to when it was a rentals platform called HomeSuite.\nHomeSuite focused on providing a quick way to find and secure short-term rentals for people moving to new cities and interested in trying out different neighborhoods before committing to a housing arrangement longer-term. The original pitch was that HomeSuite handled all the paperwork and other painful processes to make it easy both to list a place and to rent it.\nAimed at people who stay between 30 days and nine months, Tam — who took over as CEO after founder David Adams stepped away from the role — said a lot of business travellers are looking for something more when staying in a city for an extended period, with the option of a kitchen, more living space and other personalised home effects beyond what you get in a typical business hotel or extended-stay suite.\nAt the same time, 2nd Address saw an opportunity to target hosts, as well.\nThat’s on top of the work that needs to be done to tidy up and maintain a property when guests are staying for as little as one or two nights. “And of course you can have a large variety of guests, from those who are well-behaved to those who are not,” he added.\nThat “variability,” he said, “has come to a head” for some hosts who are looking for more predictable guests staying for longer than a night or two. “They would rather take a business traveller staying for a whole month any day,” he said.\nBut 2nd Address is not the only company that has identified the opportunity to provide an Airbnb-style platform catering to business users and those who want to host them.\nChief among its competitors is Airbnb itself.\nAs it inches closer to an IPO, Airbnb has been working on diversifying and expanding its operations, and part of that has been to expand Airbnb for Work, which targets business users. In January, Airbnb made its latest move in that area by acquiring Gaest, a startup from Denmark that lets people book rooms, homes and other venues for meetings and off-sites.\nIt has also tailored the wider Airbnb experience for Airbnb for Work in other ways, offering team-building experiences, a searchable database of homes and boutique hotels meeting criteria like “homes for family relocation,” “work-ready homes” and “homes verified for comfort.” Within this, it guarantees a specific check-list of amenities in the accommodations that match many of the standards of typical business hotels and might be a cut above the a typical basic Airbnb property.\nSo far, the higher-margin Airbnb for Work has had an impact: last August Airbnb said business bookings accounted for 15 percent of all its business.\nBut even putting Airbnb to one side, there are a number of other competitors also providing platforms for hosts to list apartments aimed at business users, as well as corporate travel people to rent them.\nSonder has raised more than $130 million to build out a network of its own apartments that provide experiences on par with hotels (but with a personalised apartment feel); Domio has also been targeting urban visitors (and also raising funding to do it). Meanwhile in Europe there are also several startups also vying to tackle the same market. They include MagicStay and AtHomeHotel out of France and Homelike from Germany, which has also been attracting the attention of VCs from the Valley.\nBut despite all of this, Tam and his investors believe that 2nd Address still has an advantage over the rest of the field.\nOn the topic of Airbnb, the claim is that providing properties to both consumer and business users, using the same backend, can be problematic.\nInvestors additionally think that while 2nd Address is benefiting from the overall opportunity, it also has unique and better technology. “We saw an acute shortage of vendors for monthly stays overall, but specifically also for business people,” said Paul Holland, a general partner at Foundation. “2nd Address not only proved the concept but are in a perfect position to take the market. Yes, rising tides lift all boats, including Airbnb, but it’s a very large opportunity.” He added that some of 2nd Address’s (unnamed) competitors are even using its backend and listings to power their own efforts.\nOn the tech front, 2nd Address plans to add more tools for hosts to help with home management, and beyond that planning for how they tailor properties in the future. Specifically, it sees an opportunity in providing analytics and business intelligence around guest preferences in terms of locations, pricing, detailing the interiors and more.\nIt’s also planning to add more integrations with the tools that corporates are using to book travel today. These include not just platforms like Concur for searching and booking places, but reporting and billing services to manage aspects beyond the actual stay."

        "text": "The L.A. County Board of Supervisors will vote July 17 on whether to put a new property tax on the ballot to pay for capturing and cleaning up stormwater.\nThe proposed parcel tax would cost property owners 2.5 cents per square foot of “impermeable” surface. That’s a building, a driveway, a parking lot, a concrete patio and any other surface on the property that fails to allow rainwater to percolate into the ground.\nTo determine the tax liability of each property owner, the county has already used satellite imagery and sophisticated technology to examine each parcel and calculate the impermeable surface area.\nThe new tax would burden homeowners and also the owners of commercial property, including retail stores, office buildings, manufacturing facilities and apartment buildings. It will be one more thing that raises the cost of living.\nThe county estimates that the tax would raise $300 million per year for the L.A. County Flood Control District to distribute for stormwater capture and clean-up, as well as drought “education,” workforce training, and job assistance for the homeless.\nStormwater cleanup costs are driven by the Los Angeles Regional Water Board’s uniquely tough requirements for L.A. County’s MS4 (municipal separate storm sewer system) permit. It’s estimated that compliance will cost the county and the cities in it $20 billion over 20 years. By all accounts, this is utterly unaffordable. Before imposing a tax that barely begins to cover it, county officials should demand that the Water Board justify the singular demands on L.A. County.\nCaptured stormwater in L.A. County already provides enough water for 1 million households. The county says collecting every additional drop, if that was even possible, might provide water for another 2 million of the county’s 10 million residents. But at what cost?\nSouthern Californians are already paying for Metropolitan Water District’s plan to fund most of the Delta tunnels project. L.A. County residents and businesses should not be forced to pay higher water rates and higher taxes, too, especially if this new tax will only spread money around to begin a lot of projects that will require even higher taxes to complete.\nThe Board of Supervisors should rethink this proposal."

        "text": "There is no better way to proclaim your lack of spiritual and philosophical depth than by, two decades after the fall of communism, disclosing that you're Marxist. Yet this is precisely what Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama did during a speech before 150 Chinese students at the University of Minnesota this month. Journalist Tsering Namgyal reports on the story at Religion Dispatches, writing, \"'as far as socio-political beliefs are concerned, I consider myself a Marxist.\"But not a Leninist,' he [the Lama] clarified.\"\nWell, that's a relief. Those Leninists can really kill ya'. Marxists will just murder you.\nThis isn't the first time the Lama indicated that his soul is as red as the robes he wears. During a lecture in NYC on May 19, the Tibetan leader credited \"capitalism\" with bringing new freedoms to China but then said, \"Still I am a Marxist\"; he then explained that Marxism has \"moral ethics, whereas capitalism is only how to make profits.\" That's some deep thinking right there.\nNow, I have the word \"capitalism\" in quotation marks because it was originated by a communist, and we shouldn't allow enemies of the good to define the vocabulary of the debate. I prefer to call the mostly free market in question a \"natural economy,\" as it is what naturally occurs when people are afforded economic freedom; they will buy, produce, sell and compete. In contrast, communism (in the real world, not in the stateless utopia of textbook fantasies) requires a large, intrusive, freedom-squelching government to micromanage people's endeavors and quash the yearnings of man's spirit. And because the Natural Economy does allow people the most freedom practical (we still must have courts to enforce contracts, for instance), it is infinitely morally superior to Marxism.\nHaving said this, the Natural Economy doesn't have \"moral ethics\"; it just is. It is, again, what naturally occurs when man is permitted to spread his wings. And it will be as moral as the average people who operate within it.\nIn contrast, Marxism will be as immoral as the worst people who operate within it. This is because, while the Natural Economy is governed by those hundreds of millions of consumer votes called the market, communism is ruled by the unscrupulous few who can claw their way to the top in an inevitably corrupt political system.\nBut while Marxism is morally inferior, it cannot be said to have \"moral ethics\" any more than the Natural Economy does — not in the true sense of the term. This is because it is atheistic. And a belief in morality — \"morality\" properly understood, that is — correlates to a belief in God.\nWhy? Because what we call \"morality\" can originate with only one of two possible sources: Man or something outside of him. If it's something outside of and infinitely superior to him (i.e., God) — if \"Absolute Truth\" exists, in other words — then we can say that morality has an existence unto itself and is, therefore, real. But what if, as wanting Greek philosopher Protagoras said, \"Man is the measure of all things\"? Then morality doesn't really exist; the word is then just a confusing redundancy, a water-muddying term that we apply to what is nothing but man's consensus tastes. After all, we wouldn't say that chocolate ice cream was \"bad\" or \"wrong\" and vanilla \"good\" or \"right\" simply because we found out that the greater mass of humanity preferred the latter, would we? Yet is it any more logical to proclaim murder bad or wrong if the only basis for doing so is that the vast majority of the world prefers that we not kill in a way labeled unjust? If, as with ice cream, our attitude toward murder is just a matter of man's collective preference, then it lies in the same realm: taste. This is, by the way, what people of faith mean when they equate atheism with amorality. Secularists such as Christopher Hitchens take umbrage at this, but they misunderstand the concepts involved; no one is saying that an atheist cannot act morally — only that atheism cannot, logically, involve \"morality.\"\nThe Tibetan leader answered that the [sic] Marx was not against religion or religious philosophy per se but against religious institutions that were allied, during Marx's time, with the European ruling class. He also provided an interesting anecdote about his experience with Mao. He said that Mao had felt that the Dalai Lama's mind was very logical, implying that Buddhist education and training help sharpens [sic] the mind. He said he met with Mao several times, and that once, during a meeting in Beijing, the Chinese leader called him in and announced: \"Your mind is scientific!\" — an assessment that was followed by the famous line, \"religion is poison.\"\nWell, I guess that with the Lama, flattery will get you everywhere.\nI've never heard the above interpretation of Marx before, and I very much doubt that he was a man of even private faith and non-institutionalized religion. Regardless, one of the most important points about Marx is never made: He was most likely what we would today call mentally ill. Note that he was notorious for not washing, and this is not uncommon for people who manifest crippling depression and other psychological/spiritual problems. And would it be surprising if Marx had been thus afflicted? \"There is a fine line between genius and insanity,\" they say, and Marx was a classic case of a brilliant mind that was twisted enough to conjure up a truly batty theory.\nAs for the Lama's mind, it doesn't seem as if he has to worry much about a slight misstep landing him in insanity's realm. A few years ago he was asked if he took exception to a highly sexualized image on a magazine cover, and he dodged the question politician-like, saying (I'm paraphrasing), \"This world isn't real, anyway.\"\nThen why is he concerned about what the Chinese are doing in Tibet? What does it matter if the Chicomms oppress its people and quash its culture? Hey, if the Lama and some fellow Buddhist monks are hauled off to a Chinese concentration camp, they can just mediate on how it's all an illusion.\nThe real illusion is the Lama's image. A man of authentic faith seeks Truth and doesn't deny reality, either the moral variety or the physical (\"Am I a man who dreamt he was a worm or a worm dreaming he is a man?!\"). The reality here, though, is that the Dalai Lama is, like Gandhi (about whom I recently wrote), just another overrated Eastern spiritual leader whom elites glom onto because he is quite liberal and not Western. He should stick to playing golf with Bill Murray on the bag."

Board members also discuss the concerns voiced by the membership and decide which of those the Association will take to a target-issue level.\nDuring the spring meeting in April, board members heard reports, set strategies, re-elected two officers, seated five newly elected alternate directors and approved a longtime employee to a high-level executive position. It also accepted a surprise – and sizable – scholarship donation from a mystery guest from the past.\nOOIDA’s proposed safety agenda grabbed a top spot, specifically driver training, safe truck parking availability and cab crashworthiness.\nA special guest from the Federal Highway Administration in Washington, DC, agreed that the Association’s input is vital to developing solutions to issues that are critical elements to safety – specifically truck parking.\n“I am appreciative of the time that the executive board afforded FHWA to discuss the truck parking activities that have been undertaken and to discuss those that are planned,” FHWA’s Tom Kearney said after the meeting.\nKearney is the freight operations program director for FHWA. He spent a day at OOIDA headquarters during the meeting and spoke at length to the board. Kearney is the manager of the administration’s truck parking program and has been charged with the congressionally mandated Jason’s Law survey.\nSpencer – with the DC staff’s Ben Siegrist and Ryan Bowley – reported to the board on key legislation that is on OOIDA’s radar and provided an update on issues – speed limiters, truck size and weight, sleep apnea, HOS, Mexican trucks – that are high on the Association’s priority list.\nPresident Johnston advised the board on the Association’s litigation activities, including several old cases and a few new ones. Johnston reported appeals in both OOIDA v. C.R. England and OOIDA v. Comerica Bank. OOIDA and named plaintiffs have filed suit against Pacific Financial Registry. Watch for details on that lawsuit in the July issue.\nThe Association has a number of regulatory-related lawsuits pending against FMCSA.\nThe most recent suit was filed in December 2012. The Association contends the agency is setting “de facto” regulation on fatigued driving using performance-based standards – something the agency has said it cannot regulate in the past.\nAnother lawsuit filed last year pertains to the agency’s DataQ challenge. DataQs are the process in which motor carriers can theoretically correct bad inspection data used in the Pre-Employment Screening program. That data is the same data that is used by Compliance, Safety, Accountability or CSA.\nIn both the fatigue enforcement and DataQ lawsuits the agency has filed motions to dismiss and the Association has opposed both motions.\nThe Association intervened in the hours-of-service lawsuit currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the DC Circuit. The case was argued in March and a decision is pending. In the meantime, the regulations will go into effect July 1.\nOOIDA is also financially backing and providing legal assistance to OOIDA Member Gene Michaud’s constitutional challenge of speed limiters in Ontario, Canada, Johnston reported. The Ontario Court dismissed the charges against Michaud. The court ruled that the Ontario law violated Michaud’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically the right to security of the person. That ruling has been appealed, and the appeal will be heard later this year.\nJohnston also reported to the board that OOIDA’s Washington, DC, counsel is preparing to file two more lawsuits that will be announced soon.\nThe Association’s regulatory affairs are currently managed by Spencer, Rod Nofziger, a special committee of regulatory experts from the Business Assistance Department, and Land Line Managing Editor Jami Jones. They tag-teamed to give the board additional regulatory updates.\nJones reported that the final rule on a drug and alcohol clearinghouse is now at the Office of Management and Budget for review. The Medical Examiners Registry created by a final rule issued a year ago will be mandatory in the summer of 2013. The proposed rule will automatically link medical certifications to state licensing agencies.\nJones also reported that in the fall of 2013 MAP-21’s broker reform requirements will begin going into effect.\nShe also gave status updates for the requirement of electronic stability control systems on heavy trucks in the next four years. NHTSA’s final rule is expected to be published in the spring of next year and will cover new vehicles only.\nJones updated the board on Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA), currently being audited by the Government Accountability Office and the DOT Inspector General. She said the focus of the audit is on methodology and any “tie” to safety. She said Congress is still very much focused on CSA – mostly in the U.S. House – and that there’s likely to be a hearing before the end of the year."

This is especially useful if you want to keep your wired headphones to listen to calls and music.

The new S Pen doubles as a wireless remote for taking long-distance selfies. And it still accommodates headphones without a dongle.\nThe bottom line: The ultrapricey Note 9 is one of the year’s best phones. But unless you’re in dire need of an upgrade, the smart move is to wait for what the next iPhone, Pixel and even Galaxy S10 bring.\nThe good: The LG V30 almost has it all: a great camera, speedy processor, huge OLED screen, excellent battery life, waterproofing, wireless charging, microSD storage and the best headphone jack on a phone.\nThe bad: Ergonomic quirks can make the V30 awkward to hold. You may miss some shots due to slow camera autofocus. Carrier-specific versions come with annoying bloatware and logos.\nThe bottom line: The LG V30 is a rock-solid alternative to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Plus and the Google Pixel 2 XL. If it fits your hands and your photographic needs, you won’t be disappointed.\nThe good: The OnePlus 6 is blazing fast, shoots amazing portrait mode photos, has a polished refined design, still has a headphone jack and costs much less than other flagship phones.\nThe bad: It lacks waterproofing and wireless charging, and it has a shorter battery life than the OnePlus 5T. In the US, the phone doesn’t work on CDMA carriers like Verizon and Sprint.\nThe bottom line: The OnePlus 6 is an excellent phone and gives you many of the features of more costly flagship phones.\nThe good: The Motorola Moto G6 has a near-stock version of Android Oreo, good dual-rear cameras, fast charging, its own headphone connection and a sleek design.

Instead of of being presented in the order they were posted, the app would use an algorithm to determine which posts they thought would appeal most to the user. Since then, many users have been frustrated, calling for Instagram to change back to the reverse chronological feed.\nIn the past week, many of those users have posted invitations for their followers to find them on an app called Vero. The app, released in 2015, allows users to see their timeline chronologically, and has no plans to include advertising. In a few days, Vero shot to number one in the iOS app store.\nNicholas Deleon is a senior reporter with Consumer Reports. Nicholas said that for companies that depend on advertising, an algorithmic feed is almost inevitable. \"These apps are not making money unless you're in the app scrolling through your feed and passing through ads. The grand theory behind these algorithmic timelines is that they're showing you content they think you'll like. And if you like what you see, you're more likely to stay inside and not switch away to check your email or listen to music or do something else on your phone.\"\nNicholas Deleon is a senior reporter at Consumer Reports. (Twitter)What allows Vero to keep the chronological feed is that they say they plan to make Vero a paid app. \"If their business structure is not aligned in a way that they need to maximize the amount of time that you spend inside the app,\" Nicholas said,\" that may mean that they don't necessarily need to switch to an algorithmic timeline.\"\nVero is not the first social media company to challenge the big brands, like Facebook and Twitter. A few years ago, Ello tried to take on Facebook, before rebranding as a network for artists. The app Mastodon has presented itself as an alternative to Twitter since its release in 2016, but has so fair failed to get wide adoption.\nWhether or not Vero has a chance to replace Instagram is hard to tell. \"They've definitely gotten a lot of interest in the last couple days,\" Nicholas said. \"They've added hundreds of thousands of users. So there's definitely interest in the short term, but whether or not that turns into long term success.... it's social media. It's a fickle mistress, so we'll see.\""

        "text": "Even the most innovative consumer products can have a hard time securing funding—or even knowing where to look.\nNot all startups are created equal. For one, not every fledgling small business or early stage startup is a tech company. In fact, many in today’s marketplace are not tech-centered but consumer product-focused.\nUnfortunately, much of the common wisdom about starting and growing a startup is geared toward companies with a tech angle: apps, customer solutions, social media tools, cloud companies. Even the most innovative consumer products can have a hard time securing funding—or even knowing where to look.\nTech startups have an efficient and secure fundraising landscape in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. There are hundreds of VC firms rushing to invest in tech, ready to invest tens of billions of dollars. It’s a great time to be a thought leader with a disruptive technology company! But for non-tech companies with consumer products to bring to market, it’s much harder to find funding sources, whether they are institutional, individual, or even angel groups.\nThat's unfortunate, because consumer product companies are an interesting investment. Why do I invest in consumer products? I’ve written before about investing in consumer packaged goods, and here, it’s the same simple answer: returns are more predictable. According to Cambridge Associates, from 1997-2011 (the latest year available) in US Private Equity investments, consumer/retail funds have never had a negative year. The low IRR for investments made in a given year is just over 5%, and the high is 36%—considerably more range bound than technology, which moves from -7.4% in one year to over 100% in another.\nTech startups often hire a handful of engineers and burn through a pile of cash in pursuit of a terrific but often untested idea. If you’re an investor, that means you likely have to pay out more up front and hope for extremely big payouts later. It means you probably have more losing investments for every win.\nThat mythical unicorn in tech investing—the single company, like Facebook or Twitter, that will pay billions on your initial investment—doesn’t exist in consumer products, and that's not a bad thing. Some investors fund companies with a tested product-market fit because, as the Kauffman Foundation’s Angel Investment Performance Project demonstrated, consumer products investors earn an average of 3.6 times their investment in an average of 4.4 years.\nIn addition to these characteristics, many investors will want to wait for companies to demonstrate a product-market fit. That means the product should actually be on the market, and founders should be able to demonstrate demand for it. In consumer products, the data on sell-through and door expansion can be a critical factor for early investors.\nIt is important to remember these investments are risky, illiquid, long-term investments, but for those investors that put in the time on diligence, and look at quality deal flow, I believe that for the average private investor, early stage consumer may be a better place to spend your time than technology."

        "text": "During the La Jolla Village Merchants Association’s (LJVMA) May 14 meeting at the Cuvier Club, the group received an update on the La Plaza La Jolla shopping complex construction, discussed a program to use volunteers to clean the streets of La Jolla and learned about several new businesses that have opened in the Village (see photos).\nResponding to questions about the La Plaza La Jolla boutique shopping complex being developed at the corner of Wall Street and Girard Avenue, Jon Williams, CEO of Davlyn Investments — which purchased the property at auction in 2012 — said none of La Plaza’s tenants would likely open before January 2015, at the earliest (the project was originally slated to open in December of 2013). The building was left mostly vacant after Jack’s La Jolla restaurant and nightclub complex closed there in 2009.\nWilliams said recent delays in Dempsey Construction’s remodel of the roughly 17,000-square-foot, three-level building are due to challenges with its infrastructure.\nWilliams declined to state which retailers have confirmed to lease space in La Plaza. “Timing is extremely important, as you know,” he said. “You don’t want to announce too early.\n“It’s not a matter of if, but when we open … and who we open with,” he added.\nWilliams did say a third-level restaurant tenant is eager to announce their involvement.\n“I would be surprised if, within a month, they haven’t already announced,” he said.\nLJVMA board members voted to write a letter to the City of San Diego recommending that the city waive its usual moratorium on summertime construction for La Plaza, so that work on the project can continue posthaste.\nWilliams said, noting that exterior stuccoing will begin in the next month.\nLJVMA Executive Director Sheila Fortune announced that the LJVMA will receive $46,900 in Economic Development and Tourism Support (EDTS) grant funding from the city for fiscal year 2014-2015 (the merchants group applied for $70,000). The money will be distributed to the organization on a quarterly basis.\nFortune noted that the city’s new bike-sharing program proposes 14 rental kiosks in La Jolla that will mostly be located on sidewalks or within street parking spaces.\nLJVMA board President Claude-Anthony Marengo said he is not in favor of the program taking away street parking. He said bike kiosks would be better located in street spaces painted yellow or red, if the city’s traffic and engineering departments would agree to it.\nLJVMA board members are still grappling with how to ascertain which businesses have paid for a city-issued business tax certificate (formerly business license), a portion of which funds the LJVMA’s efforts to boost business in the Village. Fortune said LJVMA’s fact-finding mission has other San Diego business improvement district groups conducting their own inventories to regain lost funds.\n“We’re even looking at getting a grant for some college students this summer to help us canvas all of our businesses so we can really get a handle on this, because there’s a lot of money that is not being collected or distributed,” Fortune said.\nThe information will be reported to the city treasurer’s office, which will seek payment from non-compliant businesses.\n“We’re operating on shoestrings when we could do so much more,” Marengo added of the lost revenue, which he said the LJVMA could use to hire a person to oversee cleaning the streets of the Village, and to take inventory of items that need to be addressed, such as maintenance of the LJVMA’s donor benches and plants and trees in the common area.\nFortune said she has reached out to an organization that offers employment to adults with developmental challenges to “possibly do some sidewalk cleanup.” The volunteers would wear a vest identifying their affiliation with the LJVMA.\nBidding opened for businesses wishing to procure one of 60 spots on the LJVMA’s Monopoly-style “La JollaOpoly” board game, which will raise money for the merchants group and its efforts.\nAbout 1,500 copies of the game are being produced, and will be available for sale at the La Jolla Village Information Center at 1162 Prospect St. and at Village businesses by the start of the summer tourist season. Bids will be accepted until Friday, May 30.\nThe game will include a variety of business categories, so that it is not all dominated by one type of business, Fortune said."

        "text": "Gov. Gary Herbert&apos;s Medicaid plan faces a make-or-break vote in the state Senate this week, possibly as early as Tuesday.\nThe Republican governor&apos;s plan is an alternative to expanding the state-federal program as envisioned under President Barack Obama&apos;s health care law.\nAfter months of negotiating with federal officials, Herbert came away with an agreement to enroll thousands of poor Utah residents in private health plans and require them to help pay costs.\nIt mirrors similar proposals from other Republican governors pushing for a way to expand health coverage under the federal law while keeping it palatable to their right-leaning Legislatures.\nThis week, Utah&apos;s GOP-controlled Senate will have to square Herbert&apos;s plan with a competing proposal from Ogden Republican Sen. Allen Christensen.\nChristensen&apos;s bill, also scheduled for debate this week, would cost the state less and cover fewer people, but leave millions of federal dollars on the table. A similar plan is pending in Utah&apos;s House.\nIf the governor&apos;s office can usher Herbert&apos;s plan through the Legislature, it will return to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for final approval and then get the program up and running.\nTo allay lawmaker concerns about the state&apos;s ability to fund Herbert&apos;s plan, the governor&apos;s office announced last week that it was scaling back the three-year program to run for two years.\nLt. Gov. Spencer Cox, the governor&apos;s key broker with lawmakers on the issue, said the pared-back plan allows the state to pay for the program without raising taxes.\nCox said the two-year program will give the state time to study what&apos;s working, and by 2017, a new administration will be in the White House that could offer different options to the states.\nHerbert&apos;s plan includes plenty of other elements designed to appeal to Utah&apos;s GOP-dominated Legislature.\nParticipants pay some of their costs and can be enrolled in a job search and job training program.\nLast year, several Republican lawmakers said they wouldn&apos;t support the plan without the ability to revoke coverage for unemployed people who refuse to get a job.\nHerbert originally sought a work requirement for participants, but the Obama administration would not approve the idea. Instead, Utah can automatically enroll people in the job program as long as it lets them opt out penalty-free.\nTo make up for the watered-down deal, Herbert&apos;s office has said the state might consider cutting state-controlled benefits to those who refuse to participate in the job program, including taking away their driver&apos;s licenses.\n\"It was brought up as an option several months ago, and it hasn&apos;t gone anywhere from there,\" Cox said Monday.\nThe idea has been dormant since lawmaker concerns have shifted from whether Medicaid participants will be working to whether the state can pay for the program in the long term.\nCox said the state could revisit the driver&apos;s license idea once the Medicaid program launches."

        "text": "On Washington’s trendy H Street corridor, the just-built Lucille Condominium boasts a classic-meets-contemporary facade of old-school red bricks and sleek, squared-off balconies. Inside, the mixture of influences continues in the Art Deco-ish penny tile bathroom floors, the bungalow-style five-panel wood doors, and the kitchens with Shaker-inspired shiny black cabinets and gleaming brass hardware.\nThanks to websites, blogs, Pinterest boards, Instagram feeds and television shows, everyday home-dwellers have access to countless decor ideas. A decade ago, only design-world savants and Moroccans were plopping Morocco’s graphic black-on-white Beni Ourain wool rugs on their floors. Now, with even big-box stores getting into design, you can buy knockoffs at Target, and the hashtag #beniourain has been used 31,000 times (and counting) on Instagram. But it’s anyone’s guess how long the fad will last.\n“Remember how popular sponge painting was in the 1990s, and how chevron was on ­everything in the early 2000s?” says Needham, Mass., interior ­designer Dina Holland, whose popular Instagram account @pleasehatethesethings showcases regrettable interior trends and choices.\nSo, how do keep your pad from looking dated just a few years after you put in a new powder room, replace the great room sofa or hang up groovy-again wallpaper in your foyer? Here are seven tips from designers.\n“I try to avoid anything that is too ornamental, too loud or that’s been all over social media,” says Bethesda interior designer Marika Meyer. “There’s a point at which, if everyone is doing one thing — strong geometric tile, ikat fabric — you might consider going with something completely different that’ll look unique and individual.” Meyer, for example, recently helped a client install a new kitchen with lacquered, turquoise blue cabinets. “They’re bold and fun, and it’s not something you see everywhere,” Meyer says. And, she says, it will last longer since it doesn’t hew to a particular trend.\nClean lines and neutral colors, while not the stuff of Instagram likes, will probably outlast current obsessions such as patterned cement tiles and benches upholstered with ratty sheepskins. Design pros preach that the backbones of your home — floors, walls and major furniture — should skew toward simplicity. In a decade, that swoop-armed Pottery Barn sofa might feel more tired than a low-slung, squared-off midcentury modern couch.\nHolland says she sometimes gets pushback from clients when she presents a design proposal with neutral base elements. “They’ll sometimes say, ‘That’s boring,’ but I emphasize that the way to do these trends — macramé, a bold pattern — is in a pillow or a small area rug,” she says. It’s akin to shelling out for the little black designer dress you’ll wear forever, then dolling it up with this season’s necklace and shoes.\nSome pared-down ideas — popular white subway tiles, white kitchen cabinets and Eames chairs — might seem trendy, especially to folks who don’t have deep design knowledge. “But if something keeps coming around again and again, like black-and-white bathrooms, I’d say it’s classic,” says S2’s Simon.\nInteriors and exteriors can also feel more timeless when they stay somewhat true to the original era of the property, especially if it’s a historic one. “In an old house, I like to keep some of the details and honor them,” Sachs says. That could mean retaining and re-staining the oak moldings and paneling in a Craftsman bungalow, or remodeling the bathrooms of a 1920s rowhouse with simple, black-and-white subway tile — nodding to what might have been there during the Jazz Age. “And I wouldn’t put a bunch of dark wood, Queen Anne furniture in a 1950s ranch house,” Kahoe says. An ideal blend? A look that considers the house’s architecture and roots along with whatever HGTV’s “Property Brothers” are installing this ­season."

Because there sure does seem to be an extra helping of crazy going on, and it’s only Wednesday!\n• The college admission scandal is just too delicious to be believed. It couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of hypocritical, liberal-run institutions. One aspect of the scandal is clear: if you are kinda, sorta rich but not Wall Street/Goldman Sachs rich, you can’t afford to buy your kid’s admission to an elite school the old-fashioned way—by donating a building. The unofficial over-under amount seems to be about $10 million. But if you’re only Hollywood rich, you can try the “side door” with a $500,000 bribe to a sports coach. In other words, the old back door for the super-rich will remain untouched, while the striving semi-rich will go to jail for the sin of cutting out USC’s development department. (Aside: Scandal seems to be USC’s leading specialty these days.) But not to worry: America’s elite colleges will go on talking about their commitment to equality, diversity, merit, and fairness, which are all revealed to be synonyms of liberal hypocrisy.\nAll campus laundry rooms are to supply laundry detergent and softener on a consistent basis for all students, faculty and staff.\nI imagine the omission of bleach is on purpose, because Klan robes and white sheets and such. Idea: Georgia-Pacific makes fabric softener. They should donate copious amounts to the Sarah Lawrence laundry rooms. And then sit back and wait to see what happens when the Sarah Lawrence student body finds out that Georgia-Pacific is a Koch brothers company.\nA study published Monday in the journal PNAS adds a new twist to the pollution problem by looking at consumption. While we tend to think of factories or power plants as the source of pollution, those polluters wouldn’t exist without consumer demand for their products.\nThe researchers found that air pollution is disproportionately caused by white Americans’ consumption of goods and services, but disproportionately inhaled by black and Hispanic Americans.\nThere are so many things stupidly wrong with this whole story that I don’t even know where to begin. First, this study, and many others like it, anchor their alarm on the supposed fact that particulate pollution causes about 42,000 premature deaths in the U.S. every year. Though the EPA relies on this figure, the epidemiology behind it is very weak. But without this scary statistic, a lot of regulations would fail even the most generous cost-benefit test.\nSecond, particulate levels have been falling fast for the last 25 years, and will continue to fall in the future. Most studies such as this one are relying on obsolete data. What this means is that most black and Hispanic Americans, even in the places that still have the highest air pollution levels like the Los Angeles basin, are breathing air today that is lower in ambient pollution than white people inhaled 20 years ago. Don’t expect NPR or anyone else to put it in perspective this way. They’ve got an agenda and a narrative that needs to be kept up."

The game was hailed as a gorgeous but broken gameplay experience. Well, Ubisoft finally explained exactly what went wrong.\nWe fell again into this trap of working a lot on the tech, and not allowing enough [time for] the teams to create the content to create something new. In the end, that's the way I see it. We created the perfect conditions for the perfect storm. We had a game that was wonderful in terms of art, but that was not renewing enough of the experience.\nGuesdon compared Assassin's Creed: Unity to the original Assassin's Creed that came out in 2007. Jean explained that both games put the tech before the content, and that both games suffered from the problem of the team trying to bring tech to life as opposed to giving gamers a very thorough gameplay experience.\nDevelopment on Unity started back in 2011 and the game was finished in 2014, a year after the Xbox One and PS4 released. It was also the first exclusive eighth-gen outing for the Assassin's Creed franchise, following up on the previous year's cross-gen outing of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.\nDespite having a three year development cycle, Guesdon notes that focusing on the \"low\" level tech blinded the team from focusing on content-driven gameplay.\nIt does make sense in a way given that most people admit that Assassin's Creed: Unity is one of the best looking games from eighth gen and that the design of France is both densely realized and artistically captivating. Unfortunately, a lot of the exploration and navigation was impeded by graphical glitches, frame-rate issues and performance roadblocks; many of these problems persisted for well after six months of the game's release.\nUbisoft decided to change the way design approaches were made for the games that followed, with Assassin's Creed: Syndicate being more content-focused, while Assassin's Creed: Origins was themed around player-choice and an overhaul of the combat system, which was mirrored after games like Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma.\nWhat's interesting is that Assassin's Creed: Unity was about putting tech before gameplay, and it didn't quite pay off due to some hiccups that the team should have fixed before it was released. Perhaps if it had six months of extra development time it could have released as an instant classic instead of developing a reputation of a rushed and buggy game.\nThese days people use Assassin's Creed: Unity as an example of a game that didn't bake in the oven long enough. It's a real shame, because it is true that it does a fine job of visually capturing the French Revolution unlike any other game before it."

        "text": "WASHINGTON — Homelessness is up for the second year in a row. That is no surprise to me. I spent the last few days in New York City, where it seems the homeless are as numerous as the tourists. They are everywhere. Not that they are not numerous in our nation’s capital, too. I returned to Washington by the train, and there are areas of Union Station that are as populated with homeless people as the nearby shelter. The scenes are appalling. What can be done?\nThe homeless have been one of the country’s vexed problems since the 1980s, when the left became concerned about them — all the more so to give the Reagan administration another social problem to be blamed for. But the truth is that the homeless have always been the left’s problem and the left’s clients. Homelessness occurs mainly in big cities, those glistening jewels of Democratic government.\nSome 25 percent of the homeless in America today live in just two cities, New York and Los Angeles. Read up on homelessness and within a few paragraphs, you will find yourselves confronted by statistics on the lack of affordable rental homes, or the lack of affordable homes, or the underfunding of our welfare programs — all to be provided by government. To which I would respond that we have spent over a trillion dollars on welfare since the 1960s when then-President Lyndon Johnson launched his War on Poverty, and we now have about as many people living under the poverty level as when we began. All that has changed is the amount of money going to the impoverished. Yet the majority of articles I have read on poverty complained that we do not do enough to keep people from becoming homeless.\nNew York City increased services to the homeless to $172 million this year, much of it on improved security and living conditions in the city shelters. Yet homelessness in New York increased by 2.8 percent, and, if recent history is to be our guide, it is going to increase by more next year. Then perhaps the Democrats will increase their spending by another $172 million, possibly by $200 million. That is the way homelessness spending has been going since the days when we used the terms “hobos” and “skid rows” to describe what was a minor urban problem. Now it is a major problem, and frankly, I do not think spending money on the homeless is the way to cope with the problem.\nHomelessness is caused by people living radically disorganized lives. The disorganization is caused by alcohol and drug addiction. It is caused by a multitude of pathologies that are never addressed by the social worker, or at least rarely addressed. Ask a social worker, if you can find one who has the time to answer your question. Most are very busy and overworked on problems that are, for the most part, impossible to solve.\nIn the meantime, many of the same people who paved the way for homelessness are busy legalizing marijuana — and, who knows, maybe cocaine and heroin next. In other words, they are paving the way to make sure that radically disorganized lives become still more disorganized. Moreover, those who are intent on legalizing drugs are paving the way for still more people to participate in the misery of the homeless.\nThe path to the future is not well-lit, but one thing is clear: If urban government continues as it has since the days when the homeless replaced the “hobo” and “skid row,” the homeless population will only grow.\nR.

        "text": "Early in its three-year collaboration with Pivotal, Ford's is already increasing its investment, for reasons that go to the heart of the automaker's long-term strategy.\nFord CEO Mark Fields introducing FordPass. Image source: Ford Motor Company.\nBased on a glance at the headlines, some investors could be forgiven if their immediate reaction to Ford Motor Co.'s (NYSE:F) $182.2 million investment in a cloud-based company named Pivotal, was to roll their eyes.\nIt could be forgiven because some – hopefully, only a few – will assume that it took its stake in San Francisco-based Pivotal as a PR play after its cross-town rivals recently announced big moves of their own. In case you missed it, Fiat Chrysler inked a partnership with Alphabet's Google unit to advance their goals on self-driving cars, and a few weeks ago, General Motors made a splashy acquisition of Cruise Automotive.\nBut, Ford and Pivotal already have a history, and this is a strategic move that fits neatly into Ford's plan to become more than just an auto manufacturer.\nLate last year, Ford announced it would be teaming up with Pivotal in an attempt to give the automaker innovative software capabilities; its three-year collaboration deal with Pivotal was aimed to help expand Ford's digital evolution in coordination with its many smart mobility projects.\nWith FordPass, advance parking for events is simple. Image source: Ford Motor Company.\nOne of the projects that came from the collaboration was FordPass, an innovative platform for consumers that will offer services such as remote access to vehicles through a smartphone app, as well as mobility solutions to help customers engage in car sharing, and find and pay for parking.\nApparently, Ford liked the results it was seeing, and believed additional investment into the partnership would bring incremental results on its path to becoming more than just an automaker – a plan that could one day unlock value for investors by forcing the market value Ford at a higher forward P/E multiple than its current 6.2.\n\"Expanding our business to be both an auto and mobility company requires leading-edge software expertise to deliver outstanding customer experiences,\" said Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO, in a press release.\n\"Investing in Pivotal builds on our current strengths in software development,\" said Marcy Klevorn, Ford vice president and CIO, who will join the board of directors at Pivotal, in a press release. \"We plan to quickly add new state-of-the-art software engineering capabilities across the Ford enterprise.\"\nStrategic moves like these will become much more frequent in the automotive industry. It's been nothing short of amazing how quickly technology has consumed not only vehicles' interior infotainment systems, but their core functionality – consider that the all-new F-150 has more than 150 million lines of software code, compared to a typical smartphone's 12 million lines.\nSoftware is even at the heart of Ford's highly successful EcoBoost engine technology, which will play an increasingly important role for the company as emissions standards continue to increase. In fact, Ford has 275 patents on its EcoBoost technology with another 200 pending -- a majority of them covering aspects of software controls and calibration, according to Ford.\nFord's investment in Pivotal was anything but an attempt to make a splashy tech investment for PR reasons; this was always a part of Ford's goal to help change how the world moves, and to extend itself into new arenas -- all of which is great news for investors, as well as the automotive industry as a whole."

        "text": "In the Negev Desert town of Sderot, Israel, Qassam rockets struck just a few hundred yards from the UN’s chief human rights representative during her visit. Having just arrived from a visit to Beit Hanun in Gaza, where she loudly and roundly condemned Israeli attacks, her car was met by angry Israelis as it made its way to the nearby site of the rocket strikes. In the Qassam attack, one Israeli was critically injured with shrapnel wounds to the head and a second rocket started a fire at a factory. The evacuated workers were outside as the UN representative’s motorcade pulled up to observe.\nAngered by what many Israelis deem a pervasive anti-Semitic UN approach, as Arbour made her way to Sderot, she was met with a less than warm reception by local residents of what is increasingly becoming described as a ghost town. Residents of Sderot have been relocating elsewhere due to the onslaught of Palestinian Qassam rockets. More than 25 rockets are reported to have been launched from Gaza into Israel in the Monday overnight alone.\nBut, when the rockets landed during her visit, the ‘less than warm reception’ turned to visible anger, as some Israelis began to pelt her car with stones and chant slogans. The rockets were fired by Hamas’ Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, who said that they did not know Arbour would be in Sderot at the time. Certainly had they known, Hamas would not have fired within eyeshot of their recently departed perceived defender.\nThough not directly from her, Arbour’s accompanying UN spokesman, Christopher Gunness, said that Arbour had pressed the Palestinian Authority sternly in meetings with Mahmoud Abbas regarding the launching of the Qassam rockets on Israeli towns. He said also that “The position of the High Commissioner is that Qassam rockets are illegal under international law” because of their inaccuracy.\nShortly after the Qassam attack on the civilians of Sderot, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights did not condemn the attack with the conviction displayed in Beit Hanun. Instead, Arbour expressed sympathy for the family of the critically wounded Israeli saying, “I want to … say how much I share their sense of hopelessness and vulnerability and frustration at being so exposed.” But the reaction of the Israelis in Sderot indicates that they are not interested in sympathy or being anointed by the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights as victims.\nIsraelis are frustrated and angry that they are forced to accept building reinforced student dormitories in Sderot in defense from the relentless Qassam attacks. This growing and increasingly vocal anger and frustration contributed to the recent decision to send the IDF into Beit Hanun in attempts to quell the attacks. It is also the source of the angry reception the UN’s High Commissioner on Human Rights received in Sderot as she loudly condemned Israeli action as “massive violations” of human rights, while seemingly left to a spokesman to define the Qassam rockets as illegal weapons, saying nothing of the actions taken by terrorists intentionally targeting civilians with them."

        "text": "Washington State University and a Seattle-based biotech firm are suing each other over the right to grow and sell the highly anticipated Cosmic Crisp apple variety, which is expected to appear on store shelves early next year.\nThe legal dispute will determine whether Phytelligence – a company founded by a WSU professor that is partly owned by the university – can use its “cutting-edge science” to grow Cosmic Crisp buds and sell them to commercial apple producers.\nBut with millions of trees already planted across the state, the outcome of the dueling lawsuits seems unlikely to affect consumer availability of the Cosmic Crisp, a flavor-packed hybrid of the Honeycrisp and Enterprise varieties.\nBrandt said the Cosmic Crisp has the potential to displace other popular varieties in Washington’s $2.4 billion apple industry, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. production. And he said no other variety has been introduced to the market so rapidly. Producers typically plant new apples a little at a time to test consumer demand, but the Cosmic Crisp, which is said to have excellent sweetness and a remarkable shelf life, promises to be a hit.\nWSU researcher Bruce Barritt began developing the Cosmic Crisp about two decades ago. Until 2012, the year he filed for a patent, the tree was known only as WA 38.\nWSU professor Amit Dhingra founded Phytelligence in 2011 to commercialize a method of growing trees from tissue cultures rather than soil, which enables them to reach maturity and bear fruit in less time. Dhingra remains a WSU professor and the company’s chief science officer.\nIn 2012, Phytelligence entered into a “propagation agreement” with the university that allowed the company to cultivate WA 38 plants for research purposes. The agreement did not grant Phytelligence rights to the trademarked name Cosmic Crisp, but it did include an “option to participate as a provider and/or seller” once the apple went to market.\nIn February, Phytelligence filed suit in King County Superior Court, claiming the university had violated the agreement by refusing to issue a commercial license.\nWSU responded last month, claiming Phytelligence had not met clear requirements for obtaining a license and alleging the company had illegally sold 135,000 Cosmic Crisp trees to a grower near Yakima. The university also filed a patent-infringement claim in federal court.\nPhil Weiler, WSU’s vice president for marketing and communications, said the university must protect the “significant financial investment” it has made to develop the Cosmic Crisp by ensuring that no one grows the apple without proper licensing and quality-control measures in place.\n“The investments made by growers over the past two decades is at risk as well,” Weiler said.\nWSU claims it terminated its agreement with Phytelligence after the company handed over sales orders and invoices showing it sold 135,000 Cosmic Crisp trees to Evans Fruit Co. in April 2016. The university also demanded that Phytelligence destroy any Cosmic Crisp plant materials in its possession.\nPhytelligence has refused to do so.\n“We are not going to destroy the material because we feel it’s within our rights to get the license,” said Ken Hunt, the company’s CEO.\n“We don’t own land, so we used ground over at Evans, in large part because we thought we’d be using some of those buds to service their order,” he said.\nBut he insisted the move did not violate Phytelligence’s agreement with WSU or the university’s patent.\nHunt said Phytelligence has refunded payments to Evans Fruit, and the Cosmic Crisp budwood is back in Phytelligence’s possession.\nAs for the company’s efforts to obtain a license, Hunt said WSU required Phytelligence to become a member of the Northwest Nursery Improvement Institute, a nonprofit association of tree fruit nurseries, but the university would not provide clear requirements for doing so. NNII has the authority to license its members to grow the Cosmic Crisp.\nHunt suggested Phytelligence faced pushback because the company’s scientific approach can generate apples more quickly than the traditional nurseries, but Weiler, the WSU spokesman, said he was not aware of such competitive concerns. Weiler said several other companies managed to obtain commercial licenses without a problem.\n“For whatever reason, (Phytelligence) chose not to follow the path that was laid out in the agreement,” he said.\nThis is not the first time a WSU-bred apple has been the subject of litigation. The university also went to court with a Yakima fruit company that had been selling the WA 2 variety under the brand name Crimson Delight. The apple was recently rebranded as Sunrise Magic.\nIn any case, Weiler said, apple lovers should brace themselves for the Cosmic Crisp. Not only is it sweet and tangy, it can retain its flavor and texture for up to a year in storage, and it’s slow to brown after being sliced, he said."

        "text": "Publicly and formally recognize each deserving person. A faculty member should be recognized when he or she performs in an outstanding way. The chair should take the lead in making sure that the person's achievement does not go unrecognized or unnoticed. The chair can organize a breakfast or lunch to honor this person's success. He can make an announcement at a department or schoolwide meeting. The important thing is to recognize this person and her achievement in a public forum.\nThe posting below looks at \\\"twenty leadership traits that chairs can use to help facilitate a more collegial department\\\". It is from Chapter 3 Strategies for Promoting Collegiality, in the book, Facilitating a Collegial Department in Higher Education: Strategies for Success by Robert E. Cipriano. Published by Jossey-Bass, A Wiley Imprint, 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103-1741-www.josseybass.com. Copyright © 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved. Reprinted with permission.\n• Emphasize consensus. Chairs should work tirelessly to gain buy-in from members of their department. This enhances a sense of empowerment as well as the fact that encouraging more ideas and suggestions-delivered in a respectful and civil manner-is a basic tent of institutions of higher education.\n• Share power. Chairs should not be power-hungry and driven by their egos. They should reach out to the faculty members and obtain their thoughts and ideas. Faculty members should recognize that the chair makes decisions predicated on the needs of the department, not personal gain.\n• Consult with all faculty members. Chairs should not be perceived as listening only to one or two faculty members. When people are listened to, and their ideas are allowed to be articulated, they are empowered.\n• Develop and implement shared responsibilities. Chairs should be aware that all faculty members must share the workload. Resist giving most of the work to a small minority of the faculty-even if they are not tenured! There should be equity in committee assignments, number of advisees, and so on.\n• De-emphasize status differences. Chairs should help to ensure that senior-ranking professors and first-year faculty members are accorded the same respect. Institutions of higher education are infamous for heightening status differences. Quality departments must refrain from this position.\n• Individuals should interact as equals. Chairs must set the tone and be certain that all people in the department are treated as equals. The chair must model the behavior she expects from faculty members, students, and professional staff.\n• Engage in generational and gender equity. Chairs should ensure that more seasoned faculty and women and minorities are respected and listened to. The composition of faculty is changing and chairs need to recognize this.\n• Celebrate. Chairs should celebrate, publicly and privately, the achievements of each faculty member: awarding of tenure, promotion in rank, writing a grant, writing an article for publication, obtaining a grant or contract, awarded the \\\"best\\\" researcher or teacher or advisor honor, and so on.\n• Maintain frequent and consistent interaction with colleagues. Hold weekly, regularly scheduled staff meetings. The chairs who interact with their staff mainly through e-mails are doing themselves and the department a disservice.\n• Establish a climate of tolerating differences. Higher education is rather infamously noted for harboring people who display idiosyncratic behavior. Department climate should encourage a dissimilarity and variation in ideas and thoughts by faculty members.\n• Focus on the behavior not the person. In the discussions that become heated, as well as normal exchanges between and among faculty members and the chair, it is the behavior that should be carefully scrutinized rather than the person.\n• Be constructive and informative. The chair is in a position to be more informed than faculty members regarding important changes underway at the college or university. The chair should present as much of this information as logic would dictate so that faculty members are spared the insidious rumors that often accompany impending changes. The chair should communicate what he knows to the faculty in a positive, practical, and useful way.\n• Link individuals to the larger context. If a person makes an ill-advised uncivil comment one time, it should not be blown out of proportion as representing a declaration that this is her usual behavior. We all have bad days. However, if this becomes a noticeable occurrence it must be dealt with, and swiftly.\n• Do not be defensive: \\\"I'm not being defensive, damn it!\\\" It is human nature that when one starts a sentence with the phrase \\\"Don't be defensive, but...\\\" the immediate response is to declare that you are not! Try not to start off a conversation with this expression.\n• Publicly and formally recognize each deserving person. A faculty member should be recognized when he or she performs in an outstanding way. The chair should take the lead in making sure that the person's achievement does not go unrecognized or unnoticed. The chair can organize a breakfast or lunch to honor this person's success. He can make an announcement at a department or schoolwide meeting. The important thing is to recognize this person and her achievement in a public forum.\n• Clarify performance expectations. The chair should meet individually with each faculty member at the start of each semester and discuss performance expectations. The expectations will be somewhat different and unique for each faculty member, based on where each faculty member is in his or her career. Of course, a tenured full professor will have a different set of goals and expectations than a nontenured assistant professor. This will enable chairs to get to know their faculty members, obtain information on their dreams and aspirations, and mentor the faculty members in specific ways.\n• Be consistent. Chairs should behave in a consistent manner so that faculty members, students, and professional staff are secure in their interaction with the chair. This behavior can serve as a reliability check to ensure that the chair is not behaving sporadically from day to day. Each person in the department should be noticeably comfortable in daily relations with the chair.\n• Keep accurate, specific, and up-to-date records. The chair should keep records of communications he has, especially those that are contentious. He should record the time and day of the conversation and the outcome. The records should be kept in a secure place and labeled properly for easy reference.\n• Do not show favoritism. Even the perception that the chair is favoring one faculty person over another sets in motion needless conflict. Faculty members have elephantine memories! Chairs should be ever-vigilant in not making the \\\"favoritism game\\\" into a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have always shared the decisions that I have made with all of the members in the department. For example, Jim was supported in attending a national conference, while Ellen's request was denied. The reason that I shared was that Jim was presenting a keynote address at the conference. Also, Ellen was requesting to go to the conference and only attend the sessions. Jim's keynote presentation brought acclaim to the department and the university. Morning classes usually being at 8:00 AM. Faculty members do not want to teach the eight o'clock class. The decision I made was to rotate the faculty so that we all (myself included) taught the 8:00 AM class every fifth semester.\n• Resist the temptation to get even and punish a faculty member (even if he is a mean-spirited son-of-a-sea cook). Chairs must personally defend against placing a faculty member in a dark, windowless, asbestos-filled office in the basement of the maintenance building. Although this may provide the chair with a warm and fuzzy feeling, she should refrain from actually doing this or similar acts (it is okay, however, to think it). Punishing this person makes the chair seem petty and vindictive in the eyes of other faculty members, students, and staff. Also, it only serves to set this person up as a victim. Faculty members do have an innate tendency to relate to victims, which could serve to ostracize the chair and significantly diminish her effectiveness as a leader.\nHiggerson, M. L. Communication Skills for Department Chairs. Bolton, MA: Anker Publishing, 1996."

        "text": "Forest defenders: Ed Hill, Fiona York and Kristin Godby from Goongerah Environment Centre.\nThe Andrews government has spent years investigating claims of unlawful logging against its state-owned timber company without enforcing any penalties.\nDocuments reveal Victoria's environment department is currently probing 27 alleged forest breaches against VicForests, reported by the community between January 2016 and December 2017 - including multiple claims involving rainforests, where timber harvesting is prohibited.\nAt least four of those cases relate to coupes in East Gippsland, where logging activities allegedly took place in or around rainforest areas without establishing protective buffers that are required under the Code of Practice for Timber Production.\nAnd in one of those cases, an entire section of rainforest was found within VicForests’ proposed harvest area before environmental lawyers obtained a Supreme Court injunction to stop the process.\nRainforest that was at risk of being logged in East Gippsland.\nAll four cases were first reported two years ago, with tender documents revealing that the department had sought to contract independent experts to examine each alleged breach “and provide expert advice that may be used in a court of law\".\nBut when The Sunday Age asked for the findings this week, the department simply said they were still being investigated by compliance officers. It is understood no regulatory action has been taken and not one prosecution has been sought so far.\nWhile VicForests says it is meeting its obligations to log responsibly, critics argue the lack of enforcement is an example of the government’s reluctance to crack down on the powerful timber industry. The highly-guarded and often lengthy nature of investigations has also raised questions about the department’s role as a regulator that is meant to be at arms’ length from the state’s logging entity.\nOrange tapes within protected rainforest marking the route of the bulldozer in the'Bellman\" coupe, East Gippland.\nWith nine months until the Victorian election, forestry policy is likely to become increasingly sensitive for the Andrews government, which came to office partly on a platform to protect the environment.\nA central plank of this plan was to create a Great Forest National Park, which would establish 355,000 hectares of newly-protected forest stretching from Kinglake to Mount Baw Baw and back to Eildon.\nGoongerah Environment Centre spokesman Ed Hill, whose organisation reported rainforest breaches, said that instead of meeting its commitment Labor had allowed VicForest to “run amok” while the department’s “impotent approach to enforcing the laws is leading to senseless and unlawful destruction by loggers\".\nBut Environment Minister Lily D’Ambrosio rejected claims of inaction, insisting that the government’s record in forest protection was “second to none”.\nConcerns about timber regulation come almost two weeks after protesters blockaded a VicForests logging operation in an area of the Strathbogie Ranges found to have Victoria’s highest documented density of Greater Glider – a native possum that the minister last year listed as an endangered species.\nIt is not the first time harvesting has occurred in an area known to have threatened or iconic wildlife, however: last year, as revealed by The Sunday Age, a dead koala was found between logged trees in the Acheron Valley - after the government ignored advice from its own scientific committee for greater protection measures.\nVicForests apologised at the time, admitting its procedures had failed. But in relation to its latest plans in the Strathbogies, the company says it had considered the environmental values and had agreed to use a “significantly low intensity harvesting method” that would only remove about 50 per cent of the trees in the planned area."

        "text": "For more than 150 years, messages of joy, sorrow and success came in signature yellow envelopes hand delivered by a courier. Now the Western Union telegram is officially a thing of the past.\nThe company formed in April 1856 to exploit the hot technology of the telegraph to send cross-country messages in less than a day. It is now focusing its attention on money transfers and other financial services, and delivered its final telegram on Friday.\n\"The decision was a hard decision because we're fully aware of our heritage,\" Victor Chayet, a company spokesman said Wednesday. \"But it's the final transition from a communications company to a financial services company.\"\nSeveral telegraph companies that eventually combined to become Western Union were founded in 1851. Western Union built its first transcontinental telegraph line in 1861.\n\"At the time it was as incredible and astonishing as the computer when it first came out,\" said Tom Noel, a history professor at the University of Colorado at Denver. \"For people who could barely understand it, here you had the magic of the electric force traveling by wire across the country.\"\nIn 1994, Western Union Financial Services was acquired by First Financial Management Corp., which First Data Corp. bought for $7 billion the following year. Last week, First Data said it would spin Western Union off as a separate company.\nTelegrams reached their peak popularity in the 1920s and 1930s when it was cheaper to send a telegram than to place a long distance telephone call. People would save money by using the word \"stop\" instead of periods to end sentences because punctuation was extra while the four character word was free.\nTelegrams were used to announce the first flight in 1903 and the start of World War I. During World War II, the sight of a Western Union courier was feared because the War Department, the precursor to the Department of Defense, used the company to notify families of the death of their loved ones serving in the military, Chayet said.\nWith long distance rates dropping and different technologies for communicating evolving — including the internet — Western Union phased out couriers in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nBy last year, only 20,000 telegrams were sent at about $10 a message, mostly from companies using the service for formal notifications, Chayet said.\nLast week, the last 10 telegrams included birthday wishes, condolences on the death of a loved one, notification of an emergency and several people trying to be the last to send a telegram.\n\"Recent generations didn't receive telegrams and didn't know you could send them,\" Chayet said.\nSamuel Morse, inventor of the Morse code, sent the first telegram from Washington to Baltimore on May 26, 1844, to his partner Alfred Vail to usher in the telegram era that displaced the Pony Express. It read \"WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT?\"\n\"If he only knew,\" Chayet said of the myriad choices today, which includes text message on cell phones, the internet and virtually free long-distance calling rates.\n\"It definitely was an anachronism,\" Noel said. \"It's amazing it survived this long.\""

It’s easy to look at a budget and just see a bunch of numbers. But the real story of the CPS budget is how we are stewarding taxpayers’ dollars effectively and efficiently to ensure equitable access to a world-class education, unleashing the potential that lies inside every student.\nWe’re providing innovative educational opportunities for our students, from preschool to high school graduation. Thanks in part to the taxpayer-supported Cincinnati Preschool Promise, over 1,500 Cincinnati 3- and 4-year-olds are getting a strong foundation at a CPS preschool.\nWe’re enhancing parent choice at our neighborhood elementary schools by investing $3.6 million to create innovative academic programs as part of our Vision 2020 initiative. Providing high-quality, culturally relevant and responsive curricula for all students regardless of what school they attend is another crucial aspect of ensuring equity across CPS.\nThe school board is investing more than $11.8 million in My Tomorrow, our initiative to ensure all students graduate prepared and with a plan to pursue their chosen pathway: enrolled in higher education; enlisted in the military particularly the Service Academies; and ultimately employed in a rewarding career.\nCPS is growing, and we’re meeting demand by opening more schools. CPS will open the Clifton Area Neighborhood School at the site of the former Clifton School during this school year, and we recently announced the purchase of the former Mercy High School on the West Side.\nAll of these investments drive student achievement, investing in the academic and extra-curricular activities that will ensure that our students are prepared for life beyond CPS as dedicated citizens and part of Cincinnati’s talented workforce.\nThere are other significant details in the CPS budget. For instance, it covers transportation and other special services for over 11,000 charter, parochial and private school students – CPS spends over $10.4 million dollars on transportation for these students alone. About $44 million of the CPS budget passes through the district to charter schools, private schools and parochial schools, including approximately $23 million of funding for EdChoice vouchers – money that appears in the CPS budget, but does not support CPS students in any manner. When you add that up, CPS loses out on over $105 million of your tax dollars meant to support academic outcomes and provide services to our nearly 36,000 students.\nNonetheless, we are meeting the challenges of growing enrollment and an ever-evolving educational environment with the creation of a new Strategic Planning and Engagement Committee. This group will look to the horizon and help CPS better plan for the opportunities ahead in the next five years, 10 years and following decades. We’re also working with our legislative delegation to ensure more fairness and equity in state funding so CPS is not as heavily reliant on local taxpayers.\nEquity, opportunity and innovation are the values we’ve demonstrated our commitment to in this budget. By investing in these priorities, Cincinnati Public Schools is ensuring our students are prepared for life.\nRyan Messer is chair of the Cincinnati Public Schools Board of Education Finance Committee. He writes on behalf of the Board of Education."

After reaching a career-high fourth in the world in 2015 he slid down the rankings as a wrist injury sidelined him for six months, keeping him out of last year’s US Open and this year’s Australian Open.\nSeventh-seeded Cilic, who needed eight match points in a five-set marathon against Australian teenager Alex de Minaur spilled into Sunday morning survived some tense moments to get past 10th-ranked Belgian David Goffin 7-6 (8/6), 6-2, 6-4.\nGoffin served for the first set at 5-4 before Cilic went on to win the tiebreaker.\nFrom there things got easier, Cilic saying that Goffin confided after the match he had a shoulder problem.\nBut Cilic still needed a third match point to clinch it."

My father had to quit school in the ninth grade. He sold ice cream in a movie theater, balloons, and worked in a leather factory. He went into the Army during World War II. He was stationed in the U.S. and read at every opportunity. His first vote was for a Communist.\nAfter 1945 he got married and started to work for a hardware store under the banner of District 65 United Auto Workers union. A trade unionist for 30 years, he was never late for work. He demonstrated in 1944 to demand that the Allies open up the second front. He was at a concert by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, N.Y., which was attacked by a fascist mob. He collected signatures for Adlai Stevenson for president during the 1950s. He rallied against the Vietnam War. I remember accompanying him to a few such rallies. The FBI knocked on our family’s door, but fortunately he didn’t go to jail.\nHe was a good dancer. He used to take us children with my mother Rose to Coney Island Beach. That was a good beach with the soothing ocean. He was a loving father and husband. He loved the feeling of music, especially the song “Brother can you spare a dime?” He never learned how to drive a car, but he could ride a bicycle. I think of him often.\nThere are those among us Americans who want the total abolition of war and not just particular wars. Many Quakers and other good religious citizens traditionally antiwar feel it is time to renew the idea of perpetual peace, which the Bible says is meant to be — this noble and honorable goal.\nWar and peace questions should not be decided by governments or politicians but by the entire people who have the most to lose in the final analysis.\nThe world’s resources are finite and war is very wasteful and upsets the balance of nature. War distorts science, keeping higher benefits from millions.\nYour paper, People’s Weekly World, is helping lead to reasonable answers. Good luck to your continuing publishing.\nThank you for your beautiful story about Nancy Mendenhall. (Review of “Orchards of Eden: White Bluffs on the Columbia, 1907-1943” PWW 6/3-9) Keep on. Stay well.\nFor 35 years I have been associated with this newspaper. I distributed it to shipyard workers on strike against John and Joe Pew — now Kerr-McGee — when the newspaper was called The Daily Worker. It was a four-page tabloid then.\nIn all those years I’ve seen things go up and down, I’ve seen the paper change too — from a daily to a weekly back to a daily and now a weekly. I’ve seen its name change a few times.\nBut it is my great pleasure to say that I am so proud of this newspaper and how it is today. The newspaper has grown and surpassed all the previous editions.\nI’ve been particularly impressed with Dan Margolis’ articles, which have been excellent and authoritative. Then I see his photo in the paper and he’s a good looking guy! So many new things in the paper that are exciting, especially the reports about young people and the YCL.\nLast week I distributed about 35 papers in a local grocery store with the “$5.15 an hour won’t cut it” headline and people just grabbed them up.

I understand as little (or nothing) about the cause(s) of the tragedies as I did before reading your double-page spread stating that “the problem is political.” The Communist Party leader and author merely states a conclusion in his first paragraph — I could not find a political analysis of the basic causes — only a call for a “dialogue” leading to a “peaceful and political” solution and what that solution would be like.\nThere is a fleeting mention of oil, and the possibility of other resources in Darfur. But no facts and no analysis of the forces — domestic, foreign, class. And if “political,” what are the political issues and what are the material bases from which they arise?"

Michelle Lujan Grisham and environmentalists praised legislation aimed at ensuring closing the San Juan Generating Station near Farmington.\nThe 83-page Energy Transition Act would allow PNM to recover investments by selling bonds to be paid off with a new fee for customers.\nThe state Public Regulation Commission would have final say over key elements of the plan.\nHouse Republican Whip Rod Montoya of Farmington opposes Senate Bill 489.\nSANTA FE – Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and several environmentalist groups on Thursday praised legislation aimed at ensuring the shuttering of the coal-burning San Juan Generating Station near Farmington and establishing ambitious targets for pushing New Mexico toward more reliance on renewable energy sources.\nThe bill is intended to soften the financial hit both to the community surrounding the aging power plant and to Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state's largest utility and majority owner of the plant, which is a major source of employment in Northwestern New Mexico.\nState Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, on Thursday introduced the 83-page Energy Transition Act, which proposes to allow PNM to recover investments through selling bonds that would be paid off with a new \"energy transition\" charge for customers.\nIt also seeks to provide funds to assist and retrain workers who lose jobs from the shutdown and sets a 2030 deadline for investor-owned utilities and rural electric co-ops in the state to derive 50 percent of their power from renewable sources such as solar and wind energy.\n\"The bill lays out the road map that will lead New Mexico from a fossil fuel-based economy to a green economy,\" Candelaria said in an interview. \"And keeping with the governor's promise during the campaign, this bill lays out an aggressive 50 percent portfolio standard by 2030, then by 2045 puts New Mexico on the path to 80 percent renewable portfolio standard, which would make New Mexico the leader in the nation.\"\nThe state Public Regulation Commission would have final say over key elements of the plan, such as the proposed fees.\nThe governor called the bill a \"robust package.\"\nCandelaria last year sponsored a bill that also was aimed at allowing PNM to recoup its losses on the San Juan plant. That bill was shot down in a Senate committee.\nAmong those supporting the bill are such groups as the Sierra Club, Conservation Voters New Mexico, Western Resource Advocates and San Juan Citizens Alliance. Also signing on are the New Mexico Building and Construction Trades Council and progressive political groups including ProgressNow New Mexico and the Center for Civic Policy.\nSteve Michel of Western Resource Advocates said the bill \"provides a path for New Mexico to move away from fossil fuels, calling for zero carbon emissions by 2045. That's a really big deal.\"\nA PNM spokesman said in a statement: \"Our new governor, the sponsors of this bill, and PNM recognizes that these are changing times. We all agree that our environmental and economic future for all New Mexicans is at stake. The Energy Transition Act takes PNM out of our comfort zone, and challenges PNM to take bold action during this historic and unprecedented time in this global energy transition.\"\nAsked whether the utility is backing the bill despite it being out of the company's \"comfort zone,\" spokesman Ray Sandoval declined to comment.\nBut at least one Farmington legislator who backed last year's version of the bill, House Republican Whip Rod Montoya, definitely is not on board with Senate Bill 489.\n\"Under the governor's plan, nearly 1,500 displaced workers will have to compete for less than 50 permanent renewable jobs,\" Montoya said through a spokesman. \"Fifty renewable jobs will not replace over $20 million in local revenue, not to mention another $30 million to state government. This plan shows a callous disregard for workers and their families.\"\nThere also is potential opposition from New Energy Economy, a Santa Fe-based clean-energy group that fought hard against last year's bill. That group is taking a wait-and-see stance.\nMariel Nanasi, executive director of New Energy Economy, said her group is still reviewing the bill, \"but if it includes a 100 percent bailout for PNM, New Mexicans have spoken and they're emphatically opposed. Why should all the lost earnings, cleanup costs and worker severance issues be paid by ratepayers without PNM contributing a penny to their bad business decisions?\"\nCandelaria said his bill recognizes that a transition to a \"green economy\" is going to be difficult for a lot of communities that have relied upon extractive and fossil-based industries. He said the proposal provides funds for economic redevelopment for the Four Corners region, including \"tens of millions of dollars\" to \"protect and transition workers\" who lose their jobs.\nBesides the inclusion of the renewable portfolio standards, Candelaria said the new bill differs from his 2018 legislation in that it doesn't say anything about ownership of replacement energy sources. \"Last year's bill said that the replacement energy would be owned by PNM,\" he said.\nSB 489 would mandate that any replacement energy sources be located in the Central Consolidated School District in the Farmington area, which, Candelaria said, would mitigate the loss of property tax revenue to schools.\nThe bill has been assigned to two Senate committees: Conservation, and Corporations and Transportation."

        "text": "Germany's population just hit a record high - so what does this mean?\nThere are more people living in Germany than ever before, largely thanks to immigration. Here's an explanation of what the new numbers mean.\nGermany's population reached 82.8 million at the end of 2016, according to government estimates. That's around 600,000 more than the previous year - an increase equivalent to the population of Leipzig - and almost 300,000 more than the previous record year, 15 years ago in 2002.\nBut without immigration - both of refugees and EU nationals - the population would have shrunk. So what do the statistics tell us?\nHow many people moved to Germany?\nAccording to the statistics, over the past year at least 750,000 more people moved to Germany than emigrated from the country. In 2015, this figure was even higher, at around 1.1 million.\nHow accurate is this figure?\nThe immigration statistics aren't exact, experts warn. The 2011 census proved this: the official count showed that around one million fewer foreigners were living in Germany as had been thought. There are a few reasons for this, for example the fact that many immigrants do not inform authorities when they return home or move to another country, while others end up being registered twice.\nWhat's more, many refugees who arrived in Germany during the 2015 migration influx were only officially registered in 2016. According to Sebastian Klüsener, an expert at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, the actual number of people who moved to Germany in 2016 is likely to be several tens of thousands lower than the official figure.\nWhere do the immigrants come from?\nThe 2016 statistics don't show this precisely. But experts agree that as well as refugees from war-zones and crisis-hit areas, economic immigrants from East Europe and other EU countries play an important role in Germany's population growth.\n\"EU migration was more significant than refugee migration in 2016,\" said Thomas Liebig from the OECD.\nWhat about births and deaths?\nEach year, more people die in Germany than are born there, meaning the population would shrink if it weren't for immigration. The so-called'birth deficit' is estimated at between 150,000 and 190,000.\n\"The number of newborns rose slightly in 2016 compared with the previous year, and the number of deaths has risen to roughly the same level as in the previous year,\" explains statistician Reinhold Zahn.\nHow can the'birth deficit' be tackled?\nThe number of women of child-bearing age in Germany is currently lower than the number of elderly people, meaning that even if these women were to have more children, it would be tough to compensate for the number of deaths.\nHerbert Brücker of the Institute for Employment Research noted that: \"Migration also increases birth rates,\" not because immigrants have a particularly high number of children, but because they are generally young.\nImmigrants from the EU usually come to Germany to look for work.\n\"Labor migration helps us to cope with demographic change,\" says Brücker. \"The public budgets, the pension insurance systems, for example, are a good thing, as is the fact that we do not have to go into the population shrinkage.\"\nWhat are the prospects for 2017?\nIt's hard to say. For one thing, it's impossible to predict how Brexit will affect European migration.\n\"This could go in both directions,\" says Liebig from the OECD.\n\"The labor market is still receptive,\" Holger Bonin, of the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), emphasizes. The economist also believes that fewer refugees will arrive in Germany over the coming year."

Though Cupertino still managed to carve out more revenue (thanks to that $1k iPhone X price-tag). But those kind of creative pricing opportunities aren’t on the table for electronics assemblers. So it’s all about utilizing technology to do more for less.\nAccording to Nikkei, Foxconn intends to recruit up to 100 top AI experts globally. It also said it will recruit thousands of less experienced developers to work on building applications that use machine learning and deep learning technologies.\nEmbedding sensors into production line equipment to capture data to feed AI-fueled automation development is a key part of the AI R&D plan, with Foxconn saying earlier that it wants to offer advanced manufacturing experiences and services — eyeing competing with the likes of General Electric and Cisco.\nThe company has also been working with Andrew Ng’s new AI startup Landing.ai — which is itself focused on plugging AI into industries that haven’t yet tapping into the tech’s transformative benefits, with a first focus on manufacturing — since July.\nAnd Gou confirmed the startup will be a key partner as Foxconn works towards its own AI-fueled transformation — using tech brought in via Landing.ai to help transform the manufacturing process, and identify and predict defects.\nQuite what such AI-powered transformation might mean for the jobs of hundreds of thousands of humans currently employed by Foxconn on assembly line tasks is less clear. But it looks like those workers will be helping to train AI models that could end up replacing their labor via automation."

Both were in play during Saturday's largely alluring program presented in Herbst Theatre by Chamber Music San Francisco.\nThe performers were three renowned soloists - clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, cellist Lynn Harrell and pianist Robert Levin - joining forces on a more or less ad hoc basis. And the evening's centerpiece was Yehudi Wyner's melodious \"Trio 2009,\" written last year for this ensemble.\nIt certainly sounded like a musical tribute to these particular players, mining the group's ability to blend lyrical strains into a unified yet distinct musical texture. Running 15 minutes in a single span, Wyner's piece proved an amiable and often lovely creation.\nIf the results aren't especially dramatic, that was surely by intent. Rather, the motivating spirit here is one of free-form fantasy, as the piece unfolds in an unpredictable but gently shifting series of episodes.\nWyner's melodic invention is the main vehicle for the proceedings, and his tunes are shapely, inviting affairs, often backlit by delicate tremolo accompaniments. For contrast, the piano occasionally urges the other two instruments into brisk, dry-eyed flurries that sound like toned-down Prokofiev.\nThe performers' mutual sympathy and unanimity of purpose gave the piece a lovely veneer, and continued to yield benefits after intermission. The second half of the program was devoted to a first-rate account of Brahms' A-Minor Trio, Op. 114.\nThis was a performance as notable for its refined elegance - especially in the two slow movements that form the center of the piece - as for its deftly balanced fervor. The rhythmic propulsion of the outer movements, shaped by Levin's strong but never strident quarterbacking from the piano, was beautifully matched by the limpid, long-breathed phrases of the Adagio.\nBoth the Wyner and the Brahms found the performers at their best, and in fact it was hard to avoid the suspicion that those pieces had monopolized all the available rehearsal time. The evening's two opening selections - Bach's C-Major Cello Suite and Schumann's \"Fantasiestücke\" for clarinet and piano - got careless, throwaway performances that made them sound like last-minute filler.\nStoltzman-Harrell-Levin Trio: Program repeats. 7:30 p.m. Mon. Oshman Family Jewish Community Center, Palo Alto. Tickets: $60. Call (415) 392-4400 or go to www.chambermusicsf.org."

        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - Scientists haven't rendered a verdict on whether coffee is good or bad for you but a California judge has. He says coffee sellers in the state should have to post cancer warnings.\nThe culprit is a chemical produced in the bean roasting process that is a known carcinogen and has been at the heart of an eight-year legal struggle between a tiny nonprofit group and Big Coffee.\nThe Council for Education and Research on Toxics wanted the coffee industry to remove acrylamide from its processing - like potato chip makers did when it sued them years ago - or disclose the danger in ominous warning signs or labels. The industry, led by Starbucks Corp., said the level of the chemical in coffee isn't harmful and any risks are outweighed by benefits.\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle said Wednesday that the coffee makers hadn't presented the proper grounds at trial to prevail.\nThe suit was brought against Starbucks and 90 companies under a controversial law passed by California voters in 1986 that has been credited with culling cancer-causing chemicals from myriad products and also criticized for leading to quick settlement shakedowns.\n\"This lawsuit has made a mockery of Prop. 65, has confused consumers, and does nothing to improve public health,\" said William Murray, president and CEO of the National Coffee Association, who added that coffee had been shown to be a healthy beverage.\nIn 2016, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization moved coffee off its \"possible carcinogen\" list.\nCoffee companies have said it's not feasible to remove acrylamide from their product without ruining the flavor.\n\"I firmly believe if the potato chip industry can do it, so can the coffee industry,\" Metzger said. \"A warning won't be that effective because it's an addictive product.\"\nCustomers at shops that post warnings are often unaware or unconcerned about them.\nAfternoon coffee drinkers at a Los Angeles Starbucks said they might look into the warning or give coffee drinking a second thought after the ruling, but the cup of joe was likely to win out.\nThe defendants have a couple weeks to challenge the ruling before it is final and could seek relief from an appellate court.\nIf the ruling stands, it could come with a stiff financial penalty and could rattle consumers beyond state lines.\nThe judge can set another phase of trial to consider potential civil penalties up to $2,500 per person exposed each day over eight years. That could be an astronomical sum in a state with close to 40 million residents, though such a massive fine is unlikely.\nCalifornia's outsized market could make it difficult to tailor packaging with warning labels specifically to stores in the state.\nThat means out-of-state coffee drinkers could also take their coffee with a cancer warning. Cream and sugar would still be optional."

        "text": "Online photos show Scott Brown before and after his weight-loss program.\nIt was not the sight of their former senator bare-chested that shocked Scott Brown’s Facebook followers.\nThey were used to that.\nIt was the sales pitch accompanying the before-and-after photos of his physique, crediting his recent, dramatic weight loss to a commercial nutrition and fitness plan.\nBrown’s testament to the merits of AdvoCare’s “24-day challenge” was met with so many guffaws that within two hours, he posted another note, saying he is not a paid spokesman for the supplement company.\nWhat he didn’t explain is that he’s a salesman.\nScott Brown isn’t the first politician-turned-pitchman, and he won’t be the last. Here are some other famous faces who leveraged their political careers to sell products and services.\nOn Thursday, an AdvoCare spokeswoman confirmed that the former US senator is one of the company’s 580,000 independent distributors. Another reporter, writing for The Daily Beast, tried to contact Brown about his involvement and received a sales pitch in reply; she could save 20 to 40 percent off AdvoCare products if she, too, became a distributor, Brown told her.\nLoyalists asserted Brown was merely spreading the word about a product that had helped him get in shape — what was wrong with promoting fitness? some asked — while others attacked him for trying to sell “snake oil” and suggested he eat organic instead.\nWhen he lost his Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren in 2013, Brown got back on a more traditional path for politicians: He returned to work as a lawyer for a high-powered Boston firm, got paid for speaking engagements, and set his sights on his next political conquest. He even got a gig as a contributor to Fox News, earning him $136,000 between campaigns.\nBut this latest gambit, which follows his move to New Hampshire and his unsuccessful 2014 bid for Senate, is seen by some as unbearably unglamorous, even for a guy who appealed to voters as an Everyman.\nMany were surprised Brown made such a detour from politics, where he has remained active on the periphery. Brown returned to Fox News as a contributor; last week, he authored a fund-raising e-mail for the New Hampshire Republican Party to benefit Senator Kelly Ayotte.\nStill, Brown’s options have become limited by the political landscape in his new state, said Dante Scala, associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire. Brown last year lost the Senate race to the Democratic incumbent, Jeanne Shaheen. With Ayotte running for reelection to the other seat, he is locked out of Senate contention for years to come.\nTo run for governor or the state Senate, Brown would have to live in New Hampshire for seven years, under the state’s election law, making him ineligible for those offices until at least 2020.\nIn joining AdvoCare, Brown enlisted with a multi-level marketer whose success relies on recruitment of new salespeople.\nThe company has been targeted in several high-profile lawsuits in recent years. In one, AdvoCare was ordered to pay $1.8 million for canceling its distribution deal with a couple who had recruited more than 1,000 people and brought in $50 million in sales. The couple claimed they were cut for being too successful.\nAdvoCare also settled a suit with Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy, who blamed her disqualification from the 2008 Olympics on an AdvoCare energy drink that she contended was contaminated by a performance-enhancing drug.\nBrown, a basketball player in his youth who became an avid bicyclist and competitive triathlete, has long been known as a fitness enthusiast.\nBut in his Facebook post, he said his wife and a friend had been goading him to get him in better shape and that his son-in-law turned him on to AdvoCare. Its “24-Day Challenge” uses an herbal cleanse, probiotics, Omega-3 fatty acids, sugar-free energy drinks, and meal-replacement shakes.\nBrown said AdvoCare helped him lose 42 pounds and made him “extremely competitive” in triathlons. He even posted his e-mail address, inviting people to contact him.\nIt wasn’t the first time Brown was faulted for promoting an unorthodox medical treatment. Last year, after he rented out his e-mail list, thousands of his followers got messages listing “5 Signs You’ll Get Alzheimer’s Disease” and a doctor’s warnings about flu vaccines and fluoridated water.\nIt also wasn’t the first time the public has seen more of Brown than expected. His youthful work as a model and a naked 1982 photo shoot as Cosmopolitan’s “America’s Sexiest Man” became familiar fodder for critics during his campaigns.\nLast year, he appeared shirtless on the front page of the New Hampshire Union Leader before a wintry plunge into the ocean for charity.\nBut what made some cringe recently was not Brown’s undated “before” picture, which showed him looking uncharacteristically bloated on a beach in Jamaica, but his seeming transformation from a would-be statesman to salesman.\nPlenty of politicians before Brown have lent their famous names to commercial advertisements, Scala noted.\nBob Dole promoted Viagra. Fred Thompson, the former US senator, presidential candidate, and actor, advertised reverse mortgages for American Advisors Group. Former speaker of the House Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill appeared in a Miller Lite TV ad and stepped out of a suitcase on spots for Quality Inns hotels."

        "text": "Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell talks to FOX 35 about the round of vetoes done by Gov. Rick Scott.\nRick Scott took a wrecking ball to the state budget this week.\nHe swung it one way and dashed UCF's dreams for a downtown campus.\nHe swung it the other and took out the concert hall at the arts center.\nHe swung it once more and destroyed all sorts of pet projects for legislators.\nMy initial reaction was to applaud.\nWhile legislators were whining, I thought: Good for you, governor.\nI loathed the secret, late-night spending spree legislators staged to end the session. And if Rick Scott was going to take a principled stand against wasteful spending, I would cheer him on.\nOne upside to Rick Scott's broad and sweeping vetoes is that it shines a painfully clear light on just how useless many lobbyists are.\nCities and counties are forever wasting taxpayer dollars on outside lobbyists who claim to know how to work the system better than anyone else.\nBut then I started digging into the projects he vetoed — and the ones he did not.\nAnd once you start looking closely, you see that this wasn't about principle. It was about politics. And spite. And indifference.\nScott cut money for the disabled, the homeless and veterans who bravely served this country.\nHe also cut money for the critically ill.\nSpecifically, Scott vetoed $9.5 million for the Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics.\nThese are doctors and nurses — many of them volunteers — who provide health care to the people who otherwise wouldn't get it.\nIn Orange County, we're talking about groups such as Shepherd's Hope and Grace Medical Home, where single parents, the working poor and the newly unemployed are on waiting lists for care.\nThese free clinics raise gobs of private funding through donations but have also received help from the state. Yes, Florida has funded them before.... under Rick Scott.\nBut this time, Scott vetoed the money.\n\"Unconscionable\" is the word Grace Medical Home Director Stephanie Garris used to describe the action.\nI'm prone to agree, especially since Scott also led the charge to deny federal coverage to 800,000 Floridians.\nThese aren't the actions of a fiscal conservative. Or a caring human being.\nI still applaud some of Scott's vetoes, especially pork projects such as the $2 million that lawmakers had earmarked for a private, high-dollar sports-training school in Bradenton.\nI can even understand why he vetoed some projects I like, including money for Orlando's performing-arts center. It's a wonderful project for our community. But that's who should pay for it: our community.\nStill, other deserving projects got cut — including $15 million for the University of Central Florida. It's the State University System. Of course the state should be funding it.\nScott claimed UCF hadn't cleared all the proper hurdles. It was an odd claim for a man who approved the creation of an entire new university — Florida Polytechnic — in 2012 after the State University System said he should not.\nPut simply: Scott plays favorites. In 2012, he wanted to reward friendly legislators in Polk County. So we got Florida Polytechnic. This year, he wanted to stick it to Orlando Sen. Andy Gardiner, who had challenged him on health care. So UCF got whacked.\nScott picked projects based on politics rather than merits.\nNeed more proof? Scott vetoed $2 million Gardiner wanted to improve water quality in a Winter Park creek system. But he approved $2 million to protect a waterfront golf course in the district of House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, Scott's accomplice in opposing health-care expansion.\nEven hard-core conservatives who used to support Scott have given up pretending his budget is crafted on sound policy or what's best for the state.\nListen, I understand politics. But rewarding your cronies with a little pork is one thing. Tanking programs that help veterans, the disabled and the sick.... that's just twisted.\nAnd killing projects that would actually help our education system and economy, simply to make a petty political point..... well, that's our governor."

Rick Perry of Texas finished up a round-table discussion Wednesday at a manufacturing company here, one man was so impressed that he leapt from his seat, offering the governor high praise.\nMr. Perry — who once mused about Texas seceding from the country he now wishes to run — has never been known for his moderation. But voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday expecting to meet the man with a blustery confidence and down-home twang were greeted with a far more subdued and measured campaigner, one who stayed mostly on message about getting “America working again” and refused to answer questions from reporters.\nNew Hampshire in recent primaries has not necessarily been kind to Southern Republicans, with former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, the winner of the Iowa caucuses, losing here to Senator John McCain of Arizona in 2008, and Mr. McCain beating George W. Bush, then the governor of Texas, in 2000.\nPerhaps with that in mind, and with the furor over his Federal Reserve remarks still making headlines, Mr. Perry was less strident here on Wednesday than he had been since joining the campaign over the weekend.\nAt his two campaign stops in the state Wednesday, Mr. Perry did indeed seem to be watching what he said, offering up a less free-wheeling and off-the-cuff presence. At the business round-table, he followed the example of Mitt Romney, going around the room and asking for questions and comments, and he spoke in a voice so soft and level that reporters had to huddle around the table, leaning their microphones in to pick up his comments.\nAnd at the Politics and Eggs breakfast, many of his usual applause lines were met with only tepid applause, if that.\nBut Mr. Perry said Wednesday that carrying out programs to reduce carbon emissions would cost “billions if not trillions of dollars.” He acknowledged that “yes, our climate has changed,” but he accused scientists of manipulating the data and was skeptical that human behavior was the cause.\n“I don’t think from my perspective that I want America to be engaged in spending that much money on still a scientific theory that has not been proven and from my perspective is more and more being put into question,” he said.\nMr. Perry’s answer did not sit well with Mr. Rubens.\n“He’s a very impressive candidate, but he was factually wrong on the earth’s climate,” Mr. Rubens said.\nSo, one reporter cheekily asked, is he just the strong silent type?\n“Strong,” Mr. Perry said, offering just the one word."

It would end the current practice of providing funds to feed prisoners directly to sheriffs, and put it in a new Prisoner Feeding Fund. Money in the fund could only go to feeding prisoners. Some excess money at the end of a fiscal year could go to equipment and operations, but not salaries.\nThe bill also increases the current daily food allowance from $1.75 a day to $2.25 per day, with an annual adjustment each year starting in 2021.\nOrr’s legislation, if passed by the House and signed by Gov. Kay Ivey, would end a longstanding and controversial practice. Under current law, sheriffs can keep excess funds over the cost of feeding prisoners. Former Morgan County Sheriff Greg Bartlett retained more than $200,000 over three years while giving prisoners meals that led many to lose weight. Bartlett earned the nickname “Sheriff Corndog” after feeding inmates corndogs twice a day for a time, and was jailed briefly by a federal judge in 2009.\nLast year, al.com reported Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin collected $750,000 from food provisions over three years. Entrekin owned several houses, including a $740,000 beach house. He was defeated in a GOP primary last June.\nThe Southern Center for Human Rights and Alabama Appleseed have also investigated conditions in state jails. Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, said in a phone interview Tuesday that identified problems in at least three counties.\n\"There were multiple inmates who talked about losing weight while they were being held in custody, being served rotten food, (and) there were local nonprofits in communities that would donate food,\" Crowder said. \"There were sheriffs taking in donated food to feed inmates while they were keeping money for that purpose … It was seriously inhumane conditions.\"\nOrr said he heard from other places in the state.\n“I had individuals contacting me from around the state saying they had to literally cook meals and take them to the jail to ensure their son or grandson was adequately fed,” Orr said after the vote.\nCrowder said the $1.75 per day was insufficient to feed prisoners and they would have been happy with a number above the $2.25 per day, though she was happy to see annual adjustments in the bill.\n\"This is certainly a strong step and it looks like a long-term solution,\" she said."

He tweeted Tuesday that he is looking at ending electric vehicle subsidies for the automaker.\nAs Axios' Dan Primack notes, there are no GM-specific electric vehicle subsidies. Instead, there are industrywide federal tax credits of up to $7,500 on EVs purchased in the United States. Trump also could not end the credits without the help of Congress, which soon will have a Democrat-controlled House.\nReality check: The $3,874 figure appears to be from a debunked internet rumor about payments received by refugees in Canada.

We're going to consider it — I told them, consider it a rifle.\"\nReality check: This is a parody account of Vice President Mike Pence.\nReality check: In this clip, Clinton is calling out the interviewer for confusing prominent African-American Democrats Eric Holder and Cory Booker, insinuating that the interviewer thinks \"they all look alike.\""

Plus, he is about an inch taller than his dad was at 15-years-old.\nCalifornia Supreme coach Mike Law told TMZ that he expects Shareef to be just as good as his father. Law added that Shareef possesses an outstanding work ethic.\nHowever, Shareef has along way to go before any real meaningful comparisons can take place between father and son. He is at least three-to-five years away from realizing his potential and a lot will depend on how much Shareef grows.\nShaquille O’Neal has never seen his son as the same type of player he was.

LongFin also disclosed at that time that it had serious problems with its internal controls regarding financial reporting. This also comes two days after Meenavalli defended the company on CNBC.\nFriday&apos;s developments add yet another reason to stay far away from LongFin stock."

Today, I'd like to follow up on the name of a drive-in restaurant, and then share a couple of new questions that could use your help!\n2. Who was owner of Jack's store?\n3. And who was H.H. Haugh?\nBack in March, reader Linda Lehman wrote to ask about the name of a drive-in eatery on East Market Street in Springettsbury Township, around where Dairy Queen and Rita's are now.\nI heard from many readers about that, and the overwhelming answer was that this was Hickey's. Reader Brenda Neff posted the question in the Yorkshire Memories Facebook group, and many there knew it.\nMore:The Opossum King of Possumtown, York County, Pa.\n\"Yorkshire is the housing development behind the present day Dairy Queen and Rita's. It’s where I grew up,\" Brenda wrote. \"A childhood neighbor, Kathie Hoffer, started this Facebook group. It’s so much fun to reminisce with this group.\" Group members also thought it later became an OK Corral, and one suggested there may have been a food-and-fuel service station named Lefty's in the area.\nReader Brenda Raffensburger suggested Hickey's as well, adding, \"As a young couple we visited the drive-in usually when my now-husband was taking me back to college. Married 50 years but still remember the good times at Hickey's.\" Brenda, I'm so glad - and congratulations on that milestone marriage!\nJohn McCall wrote, \"There was a restaurant on East Market Street where Dairy Queen and the mattress store is that was called Hickey's. There was also a restaurant/bar where Jiffy Lube sits that had several names. When it burned down I think it was called Beefsteak Charlie's. Where Nefra is was a burger joint called Burger Chef.\"\nAnd Steve Bancroft went back a little farther in time, noting, \"Rita's and the pizza shop are in what was originally a gas station that was there at least as early as the 1960s, and Dairy Queen is built on the site of a small cape cod that a high school friend lived in, Sam Freed, who became a successful actor on TV and the stage, well known to York Little Theater alumni. He was in the TV show Kate and Allie. His house was one of the original Yorkshire houses built in probably the late 1940s or early'50s.\"\nMany thanks to these folks as well as many others who wrote to suggest Hickey's as the answer to Linda's question!\n2. Who was owner of Jacks store?\nHelen Sherman wrote recently to me with a good question. She says, \"I work at Martin Library and we have someone interested in knowing who the owner of Jack's clothing store was. By any chance would you know who the owner to the store was?\"\nInterestingly, I don't even know if the store was owned by a person named Jack something-or-other, or something-or-other Jacks, or something totally unrelated, because in every rendering I've ever seen, the store is spelled not Jack's but Jacks.\nSo, any information from our intrepid readers would be very helpful!\nSpeaking of names, reader Margaret Horn also wrote in the past few weeks. She said, \"I recently came across an article of yours with photos of old store receipts; one was H.H. Haugh. I was wondering if you know what the H.H. stands for?\"\nH.H. Haugh was described as \"Dealers in new and used furniture, heaters and ranges, 26-28 S. Pershing Ave., York, PA, phone 45487\" as of a 1947 receipt by reader Lorie Redding, who had shared that receipt originally.\nMargaret, unfortunately I do not know more details, but again am hoping a reader will. Even in some very old newspaper articles I found, Mr. Haugh is just referred to as part of \"Mr. and Mrs. H.H. Haugh\" when it was noted that the couple attended a wedding. So we may be adding some good data to the historical record if we can figure it out!\nHave questions or memories to share?

It’s quick and easy, but few of us give much thought to shooting off an email, so that makes it ripe for misuse.\nBecause email is a quick tool to use, it’s tempting to shoot one off on the fly, but that often leads to misunderstandings or incomplete information, requiring a few more emails to clear up.\nWhile the content may be long, there are tricks to keeping it concise.

        "text": "Welcome to Metro’s wine guide. Every week wine connoisseur Nina Caplan will review the best tipples from around the world. Bottoms up!\nIf the wine world is a family – and given the squabbles and rivalries, it probably wouldn’t be one you’d want to spend Christmas with, if so – then South Africa is the baby, struggling to catch up with its older siblings.\nLike every other wine journalist the world over, I find a champagne column as obligatory at this time of year as a shopping splurge.\nSince I ranted about rich, warming hot climate reds last week it seems only fair to give poor pinot â shivering in its chilly soil, preparing to take all that cold weather out on the poor long-suffering winemakers â a little space.\nThe only compensations winter offers me, apart from an excuse to book a holiday, are all the unrestrained whingeing I get to indulge in â and the rich meaty red wines that provide such superb insulation, both mental and physical, from the weather.\nJust because Burgundians spend all year trying to squeeze great wines out of vineyards the size of stair runners doesn’t mean they don’t know how to have a good time.\nThere’s supposed to be no such thing as bad publicity but there is, of course: it’s the publicity that somebody else nabs, resulting in a shortage. Look at the Rhone Valley in southern France: it’s not an instantly recognisable wine name.\nTo wine lovers, the Judgement of Paris has nothing to do with some ancient Greek Male Chauvinist Pig playing favourites with a trio of attractive goddesses; this judgement is part of a very different legend.\nIn Western Australia, sometime in the 1960s, some bright spark noticed that Margaret River had a similar climate to Bordeaux.\nThe British are past masters at drinking without food; we are often told we shouldn’t do it when in fact we should, but differently. Ten pints in the pub is a national disgrace but a glass of Armagnac will change with each sip.\nSoon the clocks will go back and we’ll all have to gird our livers for the proper party season; meantime, the weather is balmy, the diary is wide-open and I, along with fellow Librans L and J, am having a party. So, what to drink?\nBordeaux’s dry white wines don’t get much attention; this isn’t because they don’t deserve it, but because they share landscape with claret (red bordeaux) and sauternes, one of the world’s greatest sweet wines.\nTrying to fathom the classifications of Bordeaux, for example, is enough to drive one to drink – if only it were more straightforward to puzzle out what one should be driven to."

        "text": "By Tracey Maclin. Tracey Maclin is a professor of law at Boston University School of Law. He teaches constitutional law and criminal procedure.\nToday, in response to a perceived increase in crime and violence, the Clinton administration has proposed police practices reminiscent of 18th-century British search tactics.\nResponding to the pleas of residents of a crime-plagued Chicago housing project, the administration announced its support for warrantless searches of public housing apartments, frisking of suspicious persons, and the installation of metal detectors in the lobbies of buildings.\nWhile the administration's proposals may please those calling for more ``law and order,\" the options developed by the Clinton plan are inconsistent with the constitutional principles James Otis helped inspire.\nThe secretary's treatment of the Constitution leaves a lot to be desired. The Fourth Amendment guarantees everybody the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. It is a ``made in America\" freedom - a product of our battle against British law enforcement methods.\nUnfortunately, the Fourth Amendment never has been popular, particularly during tough times. During the Prohibition era, the federal government routinely conducted illegal wiretaps to catch suspected bootleggers. In the 1960s and 1970s, state and federal officials continued this unlawful practice against alleged dissidents and political enemies.\nThe ``war on drugs\" involves officers going onto buses and trains and demanding to see the identification and tickets of passengers. The Supreme Court has said that police officers - acting without a warrant or any evidence of criminality - do not violate our privacy when they confiscate and search our garbage. News programs regularly show police officers, using sledgehammers and accompanied by menacing dogs, raiding the homes of persons suspected of selling narcotics.\nLooking for illegal drugs, a Boston police SWAT team using a no-knock warrant burst into the apartment of a 75-year-old minister, chased the minister through his home, and broke down a bedroom door to grab him. While being handcuffed, the minister died of what was later diagnosed as a heart attack. The police subsequently discovered they had raided the wrong apartment.\nPresident Clinton now wants better security measures at the nation's public housing projects. Tenants will be encouraged to sign ``consent clauses\" that allow police to conduct unannounced searches of their apartments. Questioned at a press briefing, the acting associate attorney general conceded that consent clauses could ``in some circumstances\" be a mandatory condition of a tenant's lease. Housing officials have also been encouraged to conduct warrantless sweeps in the case of an ``emergency.\" These measures, the public is assured, do no violence to Fourth Amendment freedoms.\nPerhaps, to make it truly voluntary, tenants should be informed of their right to reject such ``consent clauses\" and to revoke consent that has been given previously. This is their right under the Constitution. On this point, however, the Clinton proposals are noncommittal. People with limited choices about where to live should not be presented with ``take it or leave\" leases that require the sacrifice of rights that the rest of us enjoy.\nAdministration officials say that tenant support for warrantless searches and mandatory consent clauses are relevant criteria for deciding the legality of these measures. But these officials know that Fourth Amendment rights are personal; they cannot be waived by majority rule. If 99 percent of the tenants of a housing project favor police sweeps, they are free to open their doors anytime they wish. Their desires, no matter how reasonable, should not control the Fourth Amendment rights of those who want to protect their privacy.\nNow, administration officials favor immediate sweeps in emergency conditions, but leave it up to local authorities to define when emergency conditions exist. This sort of verbal back-and-forth will not satisfy constitutional norms. A warrantless search is permissible in an emergency, but the search must be directed at a specific target and supported by concrete evidence. Dragnet sweeps that encompass searching every apartment in a building do not meet these standards.\nRequiring police officers to obtain warrants undoubtedly delays the process of searching. To some, this may seem too high a price to pay, but it is the price of liberty.\nJames Otis recognized as much when he observed: ``A man's house is his castle; and while he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle.\" The Opinion/Essay Page welcomes manuscripts.

A central depository stores appraiser data, giving quality appraisers an advantage in the process if their profile within the system sets them apart as a quality appraiser.\nAn appraiser's profile is stored in the system, so it can be recalled multiple times.\nConsumers who will eventually come in face-to-face contact with an appraiser also will appreciate the system since it allows the end-customer to review an appraiser's photo and information via e-mail.\n\"The consumers will hopefully become more comfortable with appraisers,\" said Schroeder. \"We discovered the consumer would love the ability to validate and check out who is coming to their home.\""

Zarif delivered a message of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, inviting the Prime Minister for the upcoming Asian Cooperation Dialogue Summit in Iran in October this year.\nThe Iranian foreign minister, who arrived in Islamabad on Thursday for a two-day visit, earlier held detailed talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi.\nAccording to a press release issued by the Foreign Office, Zarif extended \"best wishes of the Iranian leadership and the people of Iran on the election victory led by Prime Minister Imran Khan\".\nWelcoming the dignitary, Qureshi noted the potential for \"strengthening the already strong bilateral relationship\" between Pakistan and Iran.\nDetailed discussions were also held on regional and global issues, including the situation in Afghanistan and the United States' decision to unilaterally withdraw from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — more commonly referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.\nIn May, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Iran deal, terming it \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into\". The US government had also reinstated all sanctions waived as part of the nuclear accord and imposed additional economic penalties as well.\nBritain, France and Germany had urged the Trump administration not to revoke the deal, arguing that the agreement was the best way of stopping Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\nPakistan's Foreign Office had also expressed concern on US's withdrawal from the deal, saying that the decision would affect the world community's efforts to solve the \"conflict\" with Iran.\nDuring the talks on Friday, Qureshi \"supported Iran’s principled stance\" and expressed the hope that remaining parties to the Iran deal would uphold their commitments. The foreign minister, according to the press release, reiterated that Pakistan stands with Iran \"in this hour of need\".\nQureshi stressed that Pakistan greatly values Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s \"strong and unswerving support for the just struggle of the people of Kashmir\".\nZarif, meanwhile, congratulated Qureshi on \"Pakistan’s strong protest against the blasphemous caricature competition had led to cancellation of the event\".\nFM Zarif also called on Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), regional security situation and other matters of mutual interest were discussed.\nThe army's media wing said the visiting dignitary \"acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s contributions for conflict prevention in the region\".\nIran has been warming up to Pakistan after remaining lukewarm for decades and potentially sees its neighbour as part of the emerging regional bloc that could include Russia and China. Iran this year celebrated Pakistan’s Independence Day in an unprecedented manner, displaying large greeting hoardings along major highways in Iranian cities.\nThe Iranian FM's trip comes ahead of US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Joseph F. Dunford's visit to Islamabad next week for talks with their counterparts.\nGreat. Lets revive RCD. Stay together and strong.\nGive them all the verbal accolades and moral support, make good sensible deals with them but underneath it all be very careful they will throw Pakistan under the bus at the least sign of trouble for themselves as they have done in the past.\nWe shall help our neighbor in what ever field they need help, but again how much can we do when we ourselves are in a bind.\nPakistan should first stand by itself in this hour of need, then pledge to stand with others.\nWhat about Saudi? Don’t get entangled with any “friendship” if we can’t keep up the promises.\nWhen will the empty words translate into action? The Pipeline must be completed asap.\nWell if he truly stands with Iran, why not complete the Iran/Pakistan gas line project signed by Zardari's government 5 years ago but shelved under US and KSA pressure by the Sharif government. It will help Iran and solve Pakistan's chronic gas and electricity shortage, cheaply and cleanly.\nIt is a very positive development. Though at present we have certain financial issues and there is coldness in PAK US relation, we should address these issues earnestly not in a retaliatory but conciliatory manner. Despite of this we should strengthen our bilateral ties with our neighbours and it should be our utmost priority. it would be better if the FM of both countries also discuss Afghanistan issue and give a public statement regarding this.\nIt is in the best interests of Pakistan to have cordial and warm relations with all its neighbors including even India. Millions of families stand divided apart on both sides of the border. Easing of tensions will have direct impact on lowering defence expenditure and diverting towards elevation of poverty. Similarly Iran and Afghanistan together can not only be helpful in the cited regard but would also be a good market for Pakistani goods.\nPK is a sovereign country and must build relations with all countries and protect its interest. It should not succumb to any threats or conditions from other countries including the USA which has been a bit hostile lately. Glad Iranian delegation was treated with respect.\nThere is no way of prosperity except peace and harmony with all our neighbors. Welcome Iranian FM, Pakistan should invite Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nis it me or does Pakistan now look more respectable?\nGood stance by Pakistan. We need to improve relations with our neighbors even though Saudis may not like it.\nGreat advancements by Pakistan to extend gratitude to Iran, as the regional and global nexus of power is shifting.\nPlease stick to that stand, come what may? Don't succumb to any pressure from the high and mighty power. The country is with you on this principled decision.\nSteady on Qureshi. Don't you need the IMF loan? Better not make Trump angry.\nThe USA does not care about who stands with whom.They will achieve whatever they have set out for.\nGreat going. Naya Pakistan is rocking.\nThis is how you build relationships!\nPPP and PML-N, please learn something!\nEvery one now is back looking at Pakistan as the regional power of importance.\nWhy do you have to always take sides? Just manage your own foreign policy independently. Otherwise by making that statement you have not only set wrong expectations with iran but also given another reason to USA to be upset.\nIran is one of all weather friend of Pakistan though we have not play our part due to US pressure.\nTAPI gas line is the US alternative for IPI gas line. With american sanctions placed on Iran and Pakistan being on FATF, there isn't much space for IK's resolve to materialise.\nPakistan and Iran beside being next door neighbor have lot in common such as religion and culture and in the past stood against hostile situation. Events taking place put responsibility on their shoulder to form an alliance, which should include Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Turkey.\nIran deserves justice and fair play like other countries in the region.\nI am against openly taking sides with Iran. We must firmly be in Saudi camp."

Jerry Brown’s administration.\nEven a single water tunnel burrowed under the California’s Delta would be worth it for urban ratepayers and farmers who would to pay to build and maintain the project, according to an analysis released recently by Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration.\nThe Department of Water Resources commissioned David Sunding, a professor of natural resource economics at UC Berkeley, to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of Brown’s Delta tunnel project. His report concludes that benefits outweigh the costs to ratepayers in every scenario he analyzed under a one-tunnel approach.\nAfter key San Joaquin Valley agricultural districts announced last year they couldn’t afford the project, Brown’s administration announced that officials were moving forward on a phased-in approach to the tunnels, starting with building a single pipe under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in the coming years. The tunneling project is officially known as California WaterFix.\nA single tunnel would cost $11.09 billion to study, design and build, but the project would bring a $2 to $4 billion return on that investment in the form of a more reliable water-supply, cleaner drinking and irrigation water and shielding the state’s massive water-delivery network from a catastrophic earthquake, Sunding said.\nThere are fewer benefits for agricultural districts in the San Joaquin Valley, where few hundred farmers would face a much more pronounced water-cost hike, but Sunding said San Joaquin Valley agriculture wouldn’t lose money on the investment.\nTunnel opponents say the Brown administration has long overstated the benefits of the plan and relied on overly rosy projections."

        "text": "WASHINGTON (CBSNewYork/AP) — Federal civil rights prosecutors have recommended charging a New York police officer in the 2014 chokehold death of Eric Garner, but it’s unclear if top Justice Department officials will be willing to move forward with a case, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nProsecutors recently made the recommendation to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, according to the person, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the pending case and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n“Our city has waited long enough,” he said.\nCivil rights prosecutors under former Deputy Attorney General Loretta Lynch felt confident forging ahead with charges against Pantaleo but faced resistance from federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who were not sure there was enough evidence to bring a case they could win. A state grand jury refused to indict Pantaleo in 2014.\nCivil rights activists and other observers have been closely watching how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a vocal supporter of local law enforcement, will handle the racially charged case. Because of its high-profile nature, Rosenstein must recommend whether to allow prosecutors to move forward with an indictment, the person familiar with the case said. Sessions can also weigh in but has given no indication publicly about where he stands.\nThe Justice Department did not immediately comment.\nSessions has long said that he won’t pursue the kinds of wide-ranging federal investigations of entire police departments that were hallmarks of the Obama administration’s approach to reforming troubled local agencies. He maintains the approach diminishes officer morale and can lead to spikes in crime.\nBut he has also said he will hold individual officers accountable for breaking the law.\nBringing civil rights charges against police officers is rare and challenging in any administration because prosecutors must reach a difficult standard of proof. It requires them to establish that an officer not only acted with excessive force but also willfully violated someone’s constitutional rights. Even some career prosecutors familiar with the details of the Garner case acknowledge it would be challenging to secure a conviction, a federal law enforcement official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a pending case.\nJonathan Moore, an attorney for the Garner family, said he had not been informed that charges were recommended but was cautiously optimistic.\n“We welcome this if it’s true, obviously, but it’s long overdue,” he said.\nBut Pantaleo’s attorney, Stuart London, said he has not been contacted by Justice Department officials in the last few months. He reiterated that his client maintains he did not violate Garner’s rights.\n“It has always and continues to be a simple street encounter,” London said."

        "text": "What Is Zello and How Do You Use It?\nWhen it comes to natural disasters, you never know if traditional forms of communication will fail. Of course, you’ll want to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe, but depending on your cell phone plan, constant texting and calling can get expensive. There are a number of hurricane-tracking apps out there, but Zello has become the app of choice for emergency rescuers.\nZello is a free walkie-talkie app for smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers. The app requires an Internet connection to work properly, whether it’s through Wi-Fi or a mobile data network. Unlike the standard calls you can make on the device of your choice, Zello connects you to fellow users and radio channels where large groups can talk regardless of distance.\nUnfortunately, if you lose internet in an emergency, Zello won’t be of much use. If you need a truly off-the-grid app, goTenna may be a better alternative, since it enables text and GPS while offline. goTenna requires external attachments to work, but on the upside, it's lightweight and weatherproof.\nInstall the Zello app. Open up the App Store or Google Play and install Zello. This shouldn’t take long if you have a reliable connection.\nSign up for an account. If you don’t have an existing Zello account, you’ll need to make one from scratch. The process is quick, only asking for a username, an e-mail address, a password and an optional phone number. You won’t be able to change your username after creating an account, so make sure your spelling is correct.\nAdd contacts. By entering your phone number and e-mail address, Zello can access your address book to connect you to your contacts. If you prefer to add contacts manually, the app has a search function allows you to find users by username, email or phone number. There’s even an integrated QR scanner that allows you add emergency rescue stations as a contact. And, of course, there are unfriending and blocking options if you ever need them.\nTap and hold. To get in touch with your family and friends, all you need to do is select the Contacts field in the main menu. When you’re on the contact page, tap the name of the person you want to reach, and hold microphone button to send a voice message. Pressing this button activates Zello’s walkie talkie, so the person to whom you’re reaching out will receive the message once you release your hold. If your contact isn’t logged in or connected to internet when you send the message, they’ll hear it once they can access the app.\nSend photos. At the top-left hand corner there’s a small camera icon where you can send live photos. In Zello’s camera mode, you can control the level of flash, take a selfie or add text to captured images. If that’s too much trouble, you can access your device’s photo library and send your saved images instead.Forward location and alerts. A triangle shaped toggle at the center of the screen gives you the option of adding participants to the conversation or sending your exact location. Next to the toggle lies a chat bubble icon with a lightning bolt in the center. Selecting this button initiates an alert, which will beep on your contact’s phone until he or she acknowledges it. Track interactions. An icon of an eye at the top right hand corner lets you access an overview of your exchanged messages, allowing replays or exact addresses of your last sent location. You can also monitor your calls through the Recents tab on the main menu.\nConnect to your desired channel. When you’ve selected your channel, tap the circular power icon to join or leave the chat. Intermittent beeps signal when a person from the channel is speaking. The program displays usernames while users speak, so there’s no guesswork over who said what. Users can share photos within the channel, and the eye tool provides tracking and playback options. Unlike conversations with regular contacts, you can share voice messages from the channel to your social media accounts.\nMake your own space. If you wish to create your own channel, all you have to do is hit the Add Channel button and select “Create a channel.” From there, you assign your channel a name, category, display photo, description and an assortment of settings that range from age restrictions to password requirements.\nModerate your channel. After you’ve created a channel, you’re responsible for ensuring that participants adhere to Zello’s community guidelines, which means no bullying or illegal discussions. If your channel grows to a point where you can’t manage on your own, you can assign moderators to help you keep everything in order. You can transfer ownership of your channel at any time, but once you give it away, it’s gone for good.\nTest your audio. When you check your contact list, there will be a Zello account named Echo present. Selecting this contact lets you test your audio levels to ensure voice capturing. An arrow facing the bottom right hand corner measures your connection quality, and your network’s delay in milliseconds.\nAdjust the interface. If the app’s white background is too plain for your tastes, you can switch it for a downloadable theme, such as Camouflage Talk Screen or Classic Talk Screen Dark from the Options tab.

He has bulked up and is now an animal.\n“Even in training, left or right foot he is always working the goalkeeper. He can find himself in almost any position and he will hit the bottom or top corner.\nTownsend, too, has had his critics but was able to answer them in emphatic fashion with his third international goal in seven games – and a follow-up tweet to Paul Merson.\n“Not bad for a player that should be ‘nowhere near the squad’ ay @PaulMerse?” he wrote.\n“As soon as the squad was announced two weeks ago, that tweet has been going over in my head,” Townsend said by way of explanation.\n“As soon as the goal went in, I was just desperate to get that tweet out!\n“I haven’t seen his response yet. I am eagerly awaiting it. It didn’t really annoy me, it had kind of just given me the extra incentive to silence a few critics and hopefully I have done that as I always have done.\n“Of course I have still got things to prove to people. I think you can never stop proving things to people but I think every time I have put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice."

Others include several lots in the Creekwood East Corporate Park on Lena Road, a Holmes Beach office building that has the Anna Maria Island Chamber of Commerce among its tenants, and an unbuilt professional-office parcel in Lakewood Ranch.\nOther well-known commercial properties that have fallen into foreclosure this year include the Beach Inn development on Holmes Beach and the historic Pink Palace hotel in downtown Bradenton.\nThey joined a growing list of local commercial properties falling into foreclosure as the foreclosure crisis spreads beyond its residential beginnings to ensnare office buildings, motels, shopping centers and industrial lots.\nExperts say it’s just the tip of the iceberg.\nCommercial-mortgage delinquency rates have more than doubled since the last quarter of 2008 and now are higher than during the 2001 recession, the Mortgage Bankers Association said in a recent report. About $1.36 billion of commercial property in the Tampa Bay region is known to be in default, foreclosure or bankruptcy, according to Real Capital Analytics.\nLandlords are falling behind as their tenants, battered by the recession, struggle to pay their rent or move out. About 13.2 percent of Manatee’s office space and 8.6 percent of industrial space sat empty in the first quarter, according to a recent Grubb & Ellis market report.\nAnalysts predict commercial delinquencies and foreclosures will keep increasing as vacancy rates climb and commercial credit remains tight.\nAnd many borrowers who can’t pay will have difficulty refinancing or modifying their mortgages to avoid foreclosure because of how those debts are held, she said.\nAn estimated 30 to 40 percent of commercial loans are held in Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit trusts, which are tax-exempt as long as the mortgages contained within them remain static.\nBut the Internal Revenue Service considers a modified mortgage a new one, which revokes the exemption and subjects borrowers to a 100-percent capital-gains tax, Olefson said.\nThat will have widespread economic implications beyond empty storefronts and office suites, analysts warn.\nLocal governments’ tax revenue will fall, as commercial land accounts for about 40 percent of property taxes and virtually all sales taxes. Vacant properties can breed crime, thus stretching police and fire resources. Fewer businesses means less competition, which can translate into higher prices.\nAnd the empty shopping center down the street could hit your retirement nest egg.\nDuane Marsteller, reporter, can be reached at 745-7080, ext. 2630."

        "text": "Stock Market Blahs - Or Price Breakout?\nCAUTION is the pattern for Wall Street. There's occasional volatility in the Dow Jones industrial average, but within a lackluster trading range. That pattern of modest ups and downs, analysts suggest, is apt to continue through June and possibly into fall. Still, the consensus here is that the long range direction for the market - barring any unexpected shock - is for the Dow to move past the 3,000 mark. In recent days the Dow has been running around 2,890.\nAlmost anything is possible for the stock market, as longtime watchers know too well. For the moment, however, the market is characterized by the blahs. The ``players [investors] just aren't out there right now,\" says Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Bache Securities. Two weeks ago the Dow shot up some 70 points in a few days, notes Mr. Wachtel, but on very limited volume of share sales. Then on June 18, the market fell more than 53 points, but once again on limited volume. When trading volume is low, program trading can easily kick the market up and down in short bursts.\nJohn McElroy III, who is a principal with 1838 Investment Advisors, based in Philadelphia, also sees a pattern of caution and sluggishness, in part reflecting low volume and continued belt-tightening by the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed does not appear particularly eager to ease interest rates, despite the slowing of the economy.\n1838 Investment was the investment advisory arm for Drexel Burnham Lambert Group until the Philadelphia office went independent in a management buyout in 1988. 1838 Investment manages some $3.5 billion in assets. About 47 percent of that sum is now in stocks, another 47 percent in bonds, and the rest cash.\nThe percentage of assets placed in stocks has been reduced somewhat in recent months, reflecting Mr. McElroy's perception of a modestly overvalued stock market, as well as the relative attractiveness of bonds. If he felt that stocks were a little cheaper, McElroy would be prepared to buy back into equities. He's even willing to allocate as much as 70 percent of the portfolio to stocks.\nMcElroy figures one way to invest in stocks is to look for companies with a solid global presence.\nFor now, he sees a somewhat drifting market, and even, perhaps, a slight downward market correction during the next year - but with the long-term direction upward.\nCould that upturn come even sooner?\nSome analysts say yes. Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal &amp; Company, says the market may flounder for the next few weeks, yet push through 3,000 this summer. The market, he notes, hit an all-time high of 2,935.89 on June 15. June, Mr. Seagle claims, is historically slow for the market, although he's not quite sure why. But he expects the Dow to crack the 3,000 level and settle out at around 3,150 by the end of the year or early next year.\nStockholders can only hope he's right."

        "text": "All of that and they fell a few yards short of breaking the modern-day record of 70 points in a game.\nFor the record, the all-time record was 107 points against Patterson way back in 1918.\nWonder what that game looked like?\nTo be honest, I was wondering what I was watching at times during Saturday’s 66-38 win over New Mexico State at Cajun Field.\nIt was lunacy there for a stretch in the first half.\nIt was 7-on-7 football — almost literally.\nThe new all-time record is 759 total yards, breaking the 728 against ULM a decade ago.\nThe 37 first downs were also a school record.\nNo, I’m not going to do a complete rundown of all the statistical craziness this game produced.\nAnd I don’t think I’m going to spend much time trying to figure it out either.\nSure, this series had a history of exciting high-scoring games, like 49-46 in 2001, 49-35 in 2013 and even 47-34 last year.\nFor first-year head coach Billy Napier, however, it wasn’t about records or fancy numbers.\nSure, he wants to score every time the Cajuns get the ball.\nBut as he tries to build the program, the thing that really encouraged Napier on Saturday was the small numbers, not the big ones.\nIn other words: it was how few times his players made mistakes, how few times a drive was killed due to a self-inflicted wound and how few times a great play was followed by a blunder.\nSo even if you don’t really enjoy a football game that more closely resembles a track meet, perhaps just join Napier in appreciating the execution it took to put up 66 points, 37 first downs and 759 yards.\nIn many ways, the alternative is a lot more frustrating.\nPlus, for some teams, that would be tough to do against air.\nSo, to be clear for those wondering, when the Cajuns were driving the ball down the field on their final possession needing one more touchdown to surpass 70 points, Napier didn’t even know what the modern day school record for points scored in a game was.\nFrankly, it was the farthest thing from his mind.\nNapier made it clear he understands the day will come — perhaps soon — when the offense will struggle and the defense will play the hero’s role.\nThat’s what a team is all about.\nSo he’s not worried about statistics, but rather team chemistry and honoring the honest effort his players deliver each day.\n\"I had no clue about any offensive records around here,\" Napier said. \"We're just trying to win. I don't care if we win 3-0 or 70-69. There's going to be days when we struggle on offense and our defense carries the load, and we're going to celebrate them just the same that day.\"\nHe said after the game he strongly considered going on a knee during that final drive, but felt it was only fair to give reserve running back Jordan Wright some carries after practicing all season behind UL’s trio of stud backs.\nAgain, all of that makes sense.\nAs for explaining it, maybe it’s not even worth going through the process.\nMore: Is it possible for UL's three backs to reach potential?\nNapier threw up the notion that injuries have decimated the Aggies’ defense. That’s certainly a key factor to consider what we witnessed Saturday.\nBefore the cynics simply pass it off as mid-major football in the 2018, look at the other Sun Belt scores this week.\nAppalachian State beat Arkansas State 35-9, Georgia Southern nipped Texas State 15-13, Liberty beat Troy 22-16, South Alabama beat Alabama State 45-7 and ULM surged past Coastal Carolina 45-20.\nAll of those scores make sense, and some of them are actually on the low side for this era.\nAnd don’t forget New Mexico State beat Liberty 49-41 and the Cajuns put up 42 at Texas State.\nCould it be the Cajuns are getting pretty good offensively?\nCould it be a sign the Cajuns have a better chance against the likes of Appalachian State, Arkansas State and Troy because UL’s offense is powerful and those teams are currently dealing with key injuries?\nIt’s something for Cajuns fans to consider anyway.\nAnd it sure beats trying to wrap your mind around 66-38 and 1,165 combined total yards."

        "text": "The first animal life may have emerged from a planetary deep-freeze 635 million years ago to eventually become a small part of those gallons of regular or high test that we pump into our gas tanks each week.\nA team of scientists financed by Petroleum Development Oman, NASA’s Exobiology Program and its Astrobiology Institute, the National Science Foundation and the Agouron Institute and led by UCR scientist Gordon Love discovered the oldest evidence of animals in the fossil record in sedimentary rocks of south Oman.\nLove’s team discovered “an anomalously high amount of distinctive steroids” dating from 635 million years ago to the end of the last immense ice age. The steroids are products of sponges, one of the simplest forms of multicellular animals, Love said, and have the potential for development into such valuable substances as antiviral and anticancer medicines.\nAbout all that oil in the Middle East, Love said most of it developed from “plankton (plants) which developed significantly earlier than animals.” Profusions of plankton covered the surface waters of shallow tropical seas in the area and as it died and was covered by sediment it was the genesis of petroleum. When the sponges came along, they grew on the bottom of the same shallow seas and contributed a small amount to all that Arab oil.\nAs oil companies drilled for the black gold in Oman, Love and his team took custody of the rocky core the drill brought to the surface. It gave them a vertical time window as much as 4½ kilometers deep, which they could date using radioisotopes.\nThe core was a “large cylinder of compacted rock. The stuff on top is younger,” Love said.\n“We had an unusually complete rock record,” he said, “We found them (the sponges) in all strata.\n“Oman rocks are pretty well preserved,” the scientist added.\nThe search is continuing for other strains of the sponges. “I’m pretty sure there will be more than one,” Love said.\nAn assistant professor of biogeochemistry in the Department of Earth Sciences at UCR for two years, his team made its discovery while he was a postdoctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nHe wrote his paper, which was published Friday in the journal Nature, after moving to UCR."

        "text": "Some major product news from veteran anti-tracking search engine DuckDuckGo: Today it’s launched revamped mobile apps and browser extensions that bake in a tracker blocker for third party sites, and include a suite of other privacy features intended to help users keep surfing privately as they navigate around the web.\n“Our vision has been to set the standard of trust online,” says CEO and founder Gabe Weinberg, discussing the new products. “[To date] we’ve been really focused on the search engine because it’s really complicated to compete with Google in their core market. But now that we feel we can handle that we are making progress on this broader vision of protecting people across the Internet.\n“What we’re really trying to do is move beyond a search box… What we realized from talking to people, especially over the last two years, is that privacy risks have gone completely mainstream.\nPeople really want a mainstream, simple solution for privacy.\nDDG’s aim is to create a ‘use anywhere’ privacy tool that combines access to its private search engine with tracker blocking and a bundle of other “privacy essentials” — such as an encryption protection feature that automatically sends a user to an encrypted version of a website (if there is one), instead of accepting a default non-encrypted version.\n“The unfortunate reality is that hardly any sites really deserve an ‘A’ on privacy,” says Weinberg on this. “We can get most sites up to a ‘B’ if we can… block all the trackers and get encryption. Then the gulf between the ‘B’ and the ‘A’ is actually their privacy policies.\nWeinberg claims the tracker blocker is “very effective now”, leaning on the open source community’s expertise, but says DDG also wants to build on the tool and add more privacy and blocking technologies over time — suggesting, for example, a feature that could thwart hidden cryptocurrency miners, which can get embedded on websites, as something else he’d like to add in future.\nAsked how DDG’s approach stacks up compared to Mozilla-backed private search browser Cliqz, which last year acquired the Ghostery anti-tracker tool so is playing in a pretty similar space, Weinberg argues the rival product isn’t “really integrated”. “They’re more going after a pure browser situation whereas what we’re saying is, anywhere you are, on any device or major browser, we can augment it to help protect your privacy there in a seamless way,” he says.\n“In general, I think that privacy is mainstream and people want simple, seamless solutions and they just don’t exist — until now,” he continues, adding: “We expect most of our search engine users to accept and use the extension and the app because it really extends their privacy protection.\nDuckDuckGo has been profitable since 2014, according to Weinberg. (It makes money not by tracking and profiling its users, as Google does, but by serving ads based on the search terms being used at the point of each search, and also from affiliate revenue.) Hence now feeling flush enough with cash to work on expanding beyond the core private search offering.\nOn the growth point, DDG says that over a third (36%) of all searches ever entered in its ten-year lifespan were conducted in 2017 alone. So the usage spike it got in 2013, after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden’s revelations about government mass surveillance programs, has evidently turned into some sustained momentum.\ntl;dr, privacy isn’t just a passing fad. Because mass surveillance isn’t just a government activity. The commercial web is lousy with trackers and data brokers too — and Weinberg argues web users are increasingly waking up to how they are being stalked around the Internet.\nThe pair’s use of online tracking for online profiling to power their respective hypertargeted advertising platforms is “at best, annoying”, argues Weinberg, “and at worst causing major political upheavals, like the Russian ad interference” (such as in the US election and the UK’s brexit referendum, to name just two examples on that front).\nHe cites figures that trackers used by Google are now on 76% of the top million websites and Facebook’s trackers are on 24% of pages — saying it drops off “pretty quickly after that”, with Twitter on just 12%.\nLiterally any site you visit you’re likely to have Facebook, Google watching you there.\n“I think people are aware now that hidden trackers are around, and slurping up their personal information. What they don’t realize, though, is how pervasive Google and Facebook trackers are,” he suggests.\nThe other problem that he argues is exacerbated by mass surveillance ad-targeting online business models is filter bubbles — aka the strategy of platforms using people’s own biases as a tactic to keep them clicking by reductively feeding them more of the same stuff.\nAnd, again, concern about the societal impact of filter bubbles has increasingly become a mainstream discussion point in recent months and years.\nWeinberg explains that the tracker blocker aspect of DDG’s new products group trackers into networks to try to make it easier for people to understand which companies are responsible for tracking you. So instead of just saying something generic — like it’s ‘blocking 25 trackers’, as a typical anti-tracker tool might — users of DDG’s tool will be told which tracker networks are being blocked and “what their purpose is”.\n“When people realize the harms… of filter bubble and pervasive ads those emotionally resonant with people and they’d like to get rid of them. And this is the easiest way to do that,” he adds.\nIn the European Union, an updated online privacy framework, GDPR, will apply from May. This regulation makes explicit mention of online profiling, including a right for people to object to this kind of activity — and some privacy experts suggest it could cause big upheavals for adtech and online profiling.\nBut asked for his take on GDPR’s implications for profiling, Weinberg isn’t confident it will be much of a barrier to the web’s two main commercial surveillance entities: Facebook and Google.\n“I’m a big fan of the regulation and I’m hopeful that a lot of these kind of more hidden data brokers that don’t have consumer relationships are really going to get caught out with it because they can’t get consent,” he says. “But unfortunately, the way I see it is — Facebook and Google — I don’t think they seem like they’re going to be as affected by the regulation.\n“I think you need a different consumer backlash as well — either people literally leaving the services. Or, in this case, in between: Blocking all their hidden trackers across the web. And not waiting for them to take any major action to curb their surveillance,” he adds."

I had to dump cold water on my shoes just to walk around,\" Yannick Pena, 9, complained to his mom on a recent visit to Macombs Dam Park in the Bronx, where The News found the turf hit temperatures of 145 to 160 degrees on an 80-degree day.\nAt Staten Island's Greenbelt Recreation Center, where turf temperatures reached 149, park regular Diana Stentella, 58, wondered how kids survived the heat.\n\"When they play soccer here, do they have an ambulance to take the kids away?\" Stentella said. \"On a hot, humid day you would faint out here.\"\nOver two mildly warm days last month, The News took surface temperature readings at five synthetic fields across the city accompanied by NYC Park Advocates, a group that has been critical of the fake grass.\nAt all five, temperatures at the synthetic fields soared roughly twice as high as at nearby natural grass ones, from a low of 144 degrees at the Greenbelt Recreation Center on Staten Island to a scorching 162 at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.\n\"It's sadistic that the city is installing a product which gets so hot and is actually expecting the public to play on it,\" said NYC Park Advocates President Geoffrey Croft.\n\"Clearly, artificial turf presents many serious public health and safety issues that the city simply refuses to address,\" Croft said.\nThe scorching temperatures are just one of the nagging fears critics have about the turf, an infill made of recycled crumb rubber from old tires.\nThe city has installed the turf at nearly 100 parks and playgrounds across the city. An additional 68 projects are in the works.\nEarlier this year, The News reported concerns that the millions of tiny crumbs contain heavy metals like lead and cadmium, as well as volatile organic compounds and other chemicals.\n\"This is very alarming,\" said Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum when told of The News' findings. \"Now this, on top of the other questions we have. There needs to be a moratorium on these fields.\"\nDespite the uproar, a city Department of Health study concluded this spring that the chemicals in synthetic turf fields cause no known health problems.\nHealth officials acknowledged fake fields can get excessively hot and can cause more heat-related problems, especially in children.\nWhen confronted with The News' findings, the Parks Department also conceded high temperatures can be a problem at turf fields.\nThey said they were in the process of installing signs warning visitors of the dangers at fields across the city.\n\"The temperatures can get very high during the heat of the day.

The bottoms of my shoes feel like melted rubber, it gets so hot,\" said Luis Coronell, 33, who regularly takes his 10-year-old nephew, Andres, to play on turf field because there are no real ones in the neighborhood.\n\"You bring the kids out here, but you can't do anything because the turf gets too hot,\" Coronell said. \"This turf is a killer.\""

This will also apply to all life insurers that have completed 10 years.\nIrdai said firms that have already exceeded these criteria must list within three years from the date when the guidelines are issued.

The pair are well-trained in catering to guests, as Marián spent 3 years in restaurants in Germany, and Juraj's background is in the hotel and hospitality industry.\nOn our latest sojourn, we indulged in a six-course meal. The first course was smoked salmon with three generous servings of sauces, elegantly framed in vegetables. This was followed by a salad, one with fish, the other with chicken. Our third course was a roll; one was turkey stuffed with carrot, ham and parsley and served with a lightly smoked mustard sauce, and surrounded by rice, a salad and wonderful potatoes au gratin. For the meat-free dish, the staff presented us with a medley of vegetables including baby carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, cucumber and potatoes au gratin in a light sauce.\nOur fourth course was wild game steak topped with a tangy, red berry sauce that melted in the mouth. The steak came with an elegant presentation of fresh apple, pear, kiwi and plum and croquette potatoes. The meat-free dish was a kale roll filled with surimi, carrots, sesame and accompanied by rice.\nThe fifth round consisted of three large prawns and salmon, served with a heart-shaped presentation of whipped potatoes, and for the meat eaters, a beef filet at least 5 centimeters thick and rare, but which again simply melted in the mouth.\nAre you still with us, or are you already full? One of us certainly was, but dessert is a house specialty, so save some space. This time It was a chocolate mousse with pineapple ice-cream and a maraschino cherry, together with fresh fruit.\nAll this, well served, at a gentle pace, without any feeling of delay or of being rushed. Our meal, including an excellent Hungarian red wine and coffee, cost 1,700 Sk. including tip.\nSo, you may be asking by now, where is this place? To get there, take the freeway towards Trenčín, get off at Piešťany and follow the signs to Topoľčany. Partizánske is about 15 kilometers north on the road to Piešťany. Once you reach the town, you will pass the bus station and the CEBO shoe factory. After going a short distance north of the bus station, look for the sign on the left and drive in through the gate. The restaurant is in front of you behind a willow tree. The drive takes about one-and-half hours from the center of Bratislava. If you do not feel like facing the drive back, the hotel in the square is adequate."

He has it in him extra special power which makes him a cut above the rest. By just watching him play, one can make out the difference between him and the rest.\nThe talented teenager gave a glimpse of his extraordinary skills as he won two matches in a day to steer his team Airport Authority of India to the final of the team championship in the Senior Nationals here on Sunday.\nHe first decimated Harsheel Dani of Maharashtra in the quarterfinals and later in the day, he accounted for Andhra Pradesh's K Jagadeesh. The manner in which he won both his matches underlined the fact that he is poised for greatness in the years to come.\nThe 18-year-old knows he is billed as the next Super Star of Indian badminton but at the same time he is aware of the fact that he has to keep on improving all the time.\n\"I know people say I am a special talent and have the potential to become India's best player after Kidambi Srikanth and HS Prannoy. It definitely gives me plenty of motivation and confidence. But at the same time it gives me pressure and burden of expectations. I am prepared to work hard and yes I want to become India's best player and hopefully world's best one day,\" said Lakshya.\nThe 2018 was perhaps the best year for this Uttarakhand lad as he notched up several major achievements including a gold medal in the Junior Asian Championship and bronze at the World Juniors in Canada. Tata Open title in Mumbai was another big title as he is graduating smoothly from juniors to seniors.\n\"After achieving a lot in the juniors, I now want to focus only on seniors from this year onwards. Although I can still play one more year in the juniors, my coaches and mentors have decided that I should stop playing in juniors. I have a series of international tournaments line up after this Senior Nationals and soon want to break into the world's top-50,\" said Lakshya, who is ranked 104 in the world.\nHe is targeting the next two Olympics and aiming to bring elusive medal for the country in the men's singles section.\n\"I know the time is too short for me to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but I will give my best shot.

        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17 (JTA) — When young Princeton engineer Jerry Estrin arrived in Haifa on a slow immigrant boat in late 1953 to build the Middle East’s first computer, he faced just two problems. There were no parts or tools, from vacuum tubes to soldering irons, available in Israel, and there was no staff, trained or otherwise. Now, when Israel’s sophisticated high-tech industry barely remembers its electronic progenitor, Estrin and a few old-timers are quietly marking the 50th anniversary of the WEIZAC computer, its closet-sized mainframe and some 3,000 vacuum tubes resting in a corner of the Weizmann Institute of Science.\tWhat allowed the seemingly impossible project to succeed, Estrin recalled, was the can-do optimism and improvisational genius of Israelis, just five years after they had established their state. Granted, Estrin had a few allies. One was his wife Thelma, who, like her husband, had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin.\tBoth had worked for three years with John von Neumann, the principal architect of the computer age, at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. When they left for Israel, von Neumann presented them with complete plans and specifications for the Princeton IAS computer. On the Rehovot campus of the Weizmann Institute, the legendary mathematician and geophysicist Chaim Pekeris had proposed a computer as early as 1946 for such complex projects as determining the world’s tides and delving into atomic physics.\tAt the time, Albert Einstein, a member of Pekeris’ advisory committee, asked, “Why should poor Palestine build an electronic computer when there is hardly one in operation on the European continent?” Einstein finally was persuaded and the fledgling Weizmann Institute allotted $50,000, then one-fifth of its total budget, to the computer project. The other chief backer was Meyer Weisgal, who had taken over the leadership of the Institute from Chaim Weizmann. A peerless fund-raiser, Weisgal came up with $100,000, through one judicious phone call, to purchase the computer’s magnetic core memory. The Estrins, New York natives who recently marked their 62nd wedding anniversary, settled in Rehovot with their daughter Margo, who was 10 months old.\t“My first priority was to hire a staff and then train them in the redesign, testing and fabrication of the computer,” Estrin recalled. He placed an ad in a newspaper and right away ran into another unanticipated problem. Almost all the job applicants were post-war immigrants whose educational and employment records had been lost in the Holocaust. To winnow down the applicants, Estrin devised some simple tests to gauge their knowledge and aptitude. In short order, Estrin put together a core staff of three full-time engineers, a technician and a cleaning woman, who also was put in charge of punchcards. The group was augmented by a few part-time technicians. Ingenuity was needed to scrounge or devise parts for the WEIZmann Automatic Computer, or WEIZAC. For instance, Estrin and his team needed extremely thin copper strips, but were stuck until they discovered a shack, surrounded by goats and chickens, where two recent Bulgarian immigrants had set up shop to make parts for fans and bicycles. The Bulgarians adapted their stamping machines to produce the copper strips. Fifteen months after the Estrins arrived, WEIZAC, built at a bargain-basement cost of $200,000, was beginning to function. The family, augmented by a second daughter, Judith, born in Tel Aviv, had to return to the United States.\tAfter further tests, WEIZAC went online in 1955, and after eight years and 46,000 hours of service, was retired in 1963. Over the next decade, Estrin returned to Israel every two years to consult on WEIZAC’s successor computer, appropriately named the Golem. In 1971, he organized the First International Jerusalem Conference on Information Technology, where he presented a digitized portrait of Golda Meir to the then-prime minister herself.\tIf the Estrins’ work left their mark on Israel, the country left its mark on the family. “The WEIZAC project drove me to make a contribution beyond my dreams,” Estrin, now 82, reminisced recently in his Santa Monica home. Building a team and heading a project in the Israeli work environment wrought changes in Estrin’s mild-mannered personality. “I learned how to pound tables, which stood me in good stead when later I became chairman of the UCLA computer science department,” he said with a half-smile.\t“But I really fell in love with the people and if it had been up to my wife, we would have stayed,” he added.\tEstrin’s legacy to Israel has been long-lasting. By building its own computer in the face of widespread skepticism, Israel “got into the information revolution early in the game,” he said. Perhaps most important, WEIZAC spawned a cadre of engineers and technicians who, with their successors, went on to staff the country’s high-tech industry and top academic institutions. The contributions of the two WEIZAC pioneers have been honored and perpetuated through the Estrin Family Chair in Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute, on whose board of governors Estrin served for more than two decades. A year after they returned to the United States, UCLA asked both Estrins to join its faculty, Jerry as a professor to build a program in computer engineering and Thelma as a pioneer developer of computer applications in brain research.\tThe Estrins have left a legacy of another kind through their three high-achieving daughters. They also have four grandchildren. Judith has become a Silicon Valley icon, founding four companies and now serving as president and CEO of Packet Design, LLC, which develops networking technology. She has been named three times in Fortune magazine’s list of the 50 most powerful women in American business. Deborah, the youngest daughter, is a computer science professor at UCLA and founding director of the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, which last year received a $40 million grant over 10 years from the National Science Foundation.\tOnly Margo, who was part of the WEIZAC period as an infant, has broken the family tradition by becoming a doctor of internal medicine, practicing in the San Francisco Bay area."

        "text": "Community gardens provide city residents with many benefits, like healthy local produce, social connection and can even stress reduction. But pollution in urban areas, particularly ones with industrial histories, can potentially pose health risks to gardeners and the people who eat their produce.\nHow serious is the risk? It depends a lot on the gardener. A study conducted by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Urban Health Institute surveyed urban gardeners in Baltimore, to better understand their knowledge of potential soil contaminants and remediation techniques. The paper was published in the open-access journal PLOS.\nWith help from the Community Greening Resource Network, information was gathered from 70 gardeners through semi-formal interviews. In exchange for participating in the survey, the researchers offered to help gardeners get their soil tested.\nThe researchers found that gardeners had minimal concern about soil contaminants, and often assumed that if the garden was established then contamination issues had already been addressed. This could be a problem not only because contaminants may make their way into food grown at the garden, but also because contaminated soil may pose a risk to gardeners who touch it.\nThe most worrisome chemical to community gardeners was lead, and rightly so considering tests show higher levels of lead in Baltimore soils than other potential contaminants. However, the researchers write that knowing the history of a plot is key to testing for the right substances.\nThe most common method of avoiding polluted soil within the surveyed group was the use of raised beds with imported soil. However, raised beds can still become contaminated when dirt from outside of the beds is kicked up, from atmospheric particles settling into the beds, and when roots reach deeper than the beds. The community gardeners didn't mention some of the best practices for avoiding contact with chemicals of concern, like growing produce away from busy streets, application of soil amendments, removing shoes to avoid tracking contaminants into the home, washing produce, and peeling root crops.\nFortunately, a number of the study participants were quick to acknowledge their limitations and were eager to learn how to avoid contaminants.\n\"One theme that emerged from informant interviews was the need for a central repository where gardeners could access information about soil contamination,\" the authors write. This could be done by an organization that already has a relationship with community gardens or though the local government.\nThey also write that face-to-face information, through workshops or from master gardeners, is an important means of sharing information. Although 83 percent of the study participants had a bachelor's degree, getting information from fellow growers may be an important way of reaching less educated and lower income gardeners. The authors also suggest that some responsibilities such as soil testing could be handled by city governments.\nDespite the dangers of soil contamination, the researchers emphasize the need to balance warnings with information about the benefits of gardening, so as to not discourage gardeners from planting altogether.\nCommunity gardens provide many benefits to city residents, but pollution poses health risks."

Since he took office as the mayor on December 2 he has taken part in the “car-free Tuesdays” campaign and either cycle to work or use public transport.\nCar-free Tuesdays campaign kicked off in 2016 by Mohammad Bakhtiari, majored in architecture and a member of a local NGO and it aimed to decrease the number of private cars in the cities hence mitigate air pollution.\nHanachi also said that the municipality is negotiating with bicycle manufacturing companies as well as knowledge-based companies to try to reduce the costs of electric bikes.\nThe key measure which should be taken to slash to costs of electric bikes is domestic production of them, he suggested, adding that electric bikes and motorcycles should replace carbureted vehicles to tackle air pollution.\nHe also noted that instead of granting subsidies to electric bikes the municipality is planning on developing bike sharing programs.\nIn December 2018 new bikes based on Internet of Things (IoT) were placed for the first time into stations for use in Tehran. Some 300 bikes have been inaugurated in district 2 of the capital.\nBike-sharing scheme was first introduced by the Iranian startup Bdood in August 2018 in an attempt to address air pollution in the metropolis of Tehran."

Because of these concerns the RSPCA wouldn’t recommend that cats are walked outside in this way. If a cat is going to be walked outside on a harness the cat should be introduced to the experience in a slow, gradual and positive manner. If any signs of distress are seen such as the cat trying to pull away or get away the interaction should be stopped immediately.\nThe fatter cats become, the more severe the impact on their mental wellbeing.\nThey struggle to groom themselves and that can cause them all kinds of emotional distress.\nHouse cats need to be played with energetically for 30 minutes a day – even if it’s just with a battery-powered mouse or piece of string.\nSo if you’ve got a very fat cat, for the love of God stop feeding them Dreamies every second and kick them out into the garden for half an hour.\nPudgy animals might be cute but allowing them to become overweight or actively encouraging them to be obese is cruel.\nMORE: Are Love Hearts vegetarian, vegan or halal?"

But then you notice an extra-ordinary feature of this housing project: it offers a nuclear bunker. This, my friend, is what Germans mean by zeitgeist, the spirit of the times.\nWe in Delhi live expecting a nuclear attack the way people in Mumbai expect to be stuck in traffic or the residents of Chennai are resigned to giant cut-outs blotting the skyline. If you did not quite know this, despite bustling through the business of life in the national Capital, don’t be too hard on yourself. No one knew they needed an iPod till Steve Jobs unveiled one in October 2001, after he had already launched a version of iTunes for the Macintosh computer. A functional internet was in place, even if access to high-speed broadband was a privilege. The electronics was ready to mass-produce iPods. People loved music, listening to music and not listening to the guy in front was part of the popular culture. All it needed was the design and marketing genius of Steve Jobs to make a phenomenon out of the iPod, and later, the iPhone.\nThe neurosis is already in place, to make a nuclear bunker look like not just a good idea but something we just cannot do without. A climate of fear, the constant dread of an enemy poised to strike anytime anywhere, with the help of contingents of anti-national traitors standing ready to do their bit to break up the motherland, the ever looming presence of the soldier in the public discourse, with retired generals pulverising the enemy every minute of evening prime-time television, the army chief speaking like a politician (meaning, of course, with polished grace, total logic and relying on hard facts authenticated on Whatsapp), a dominant narrative in which anyone who dares to differ with the dominant narrative is automatically a traitor, deserving to be charged with sedition and thrashed in the courtroom, a high-priest of the gospel of the besieged and media outlets eager to spread the grim word — what more could makers of nuclear bunkers ask for?\nThe sheer banality of offering a nuclear bunker along with indoor squash courts and poolside party spaces serves an important purpose: it is part of normalising the neurosis. Have the barista pour you a flat white and, while sipping it, if the sirens go off, announcing an air attack, gulp down anti-national thoughts about why our brave airmen and fancy missile interceptors failed to fend off the menace whizzing towards you, and duck into the nuclear bunker. Come out once the attack is over, go back and finish your coffee and reach for that squash racquet. Did someone mutter something about nuclear winter, electromagnetic storms and radiation that Geiger cannot count? What you don’t know won’t hurt you, because you would be beyond this-worldly sensation.\nWhy blame this neurosis on an internal ideology of being under siege, of victimhood? Isn’t the Pak threat real? Do not Pak generals see terror as an instrumentality of strategic reach beyond what nuclear bombs, tactical as well as medium range missiles and the world’s sixth largest army offer Pakistan? Of course, the answer to both the questions is in the affirmative. But that does not mean that Pakistan’s capacity for mischief cannot be contained, if not quite neutered, without India drawing itself into a shell like a tortoise.\nIndia has to be on guard against external aggression and against internal subversion. India has been doing both, quite effectively, over the decades; and Pakistan is hollowing itself out as a country that spends more on defence than it can afford, cuts back on essential services, not to speak of welfare, and will soon be forced to choose between popular revolt and scaling down of delusions of military grandeur.\nThe process began with the break-up of Pakistan, the creation of Bangladesh, India’s nuclear test of 1974 and steady accretion of economic and military muscle. The build-up of the Taliban, with CIA help to throw out the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, and the sponsoring of terror groups focused on Kashmir gave Pakistan’s ambitions extra rope. The spawn of religious radicalisation Pakistan encouraged to create recruits for jihad now attack Pakistan itself. As Pakistan battles all-round backwardness, religious extremism and social instability, Bangladesh has overtaken Pakistan in per capita income and on almost all indicators of social development. Only China’s support to Pakistan, designed to tie India down to South Asia, postpones Pakistan’s reckoning with the dead-end of its strategy of defining itself in hostility towards India.\nIndia is perfectly capable of wearing Pakistan down, while putting down its offensive thrusts, including terror modules within India. After the 2008 Mumbai attack, Indian security agencies hunted down and destroyed all domestic terror modules. No, the problem is not that containment is not viable without India getting into a mental lockdown. The problem is the Hindutva ideology, which wants to redefine Indian nationhood as Hindu and portray all non-Hindus as potential enemies and second class citizens, and a political strategy of creating a sense of insecurity orchestrated by constant cries of external threats and internal treason. Insecure people look for heroes to save them. A hero has obliged without notable reluctance.\nThe house with the nuclear bunker attached is a manifestation of the spirit of these times, Achhe Din, the good times we had been promised five years ago."

But many of the underlying causes of the Arab Spring remain, such as unemployment, underemployment, lack of voice, and participation.\n\"Like their peers in the West, young Arabs today are digital natives,\" Sunil John, founder and CEO, ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller, tells ZDNet.\n\"Smartphone penetration across the region is nearly 100 percent. So, deficits in accessing wired internet, which are serious in parts of the Middle East, are somewhat remedied by the availability of smartphones and data services.\"\nJohn's company has tracked the attitudes and behaviors of this cohort through the annual Arab Youth survey, which in 2018 celebrated its 10th anniversary.\n\"Young people view the digital revolution as the third most important development shaping the region over the past 10 years, after the rise of Daesh and the Arab Spring,\" he says.\"But the digital revolution is seen as the most important positive development in the region, with 60 percent of young Arabs viewing it as a good thing.\"\nHe argues that the biggest change has been how young Arabs consume media.\n\"Young Arabs are now getting their news first on social media, not television. This year, our survey reveals almost two thirds (63 percent) of young Arabs say they look first to Facebook and Twitter for news. Three years ago, that was just a quarter.\"\nWhere young Arabs get their news.\nAlthough young Arabs have benefited from increased technological adoption, which in turn has resulted in changing digital behaviors, many of the wider political and socio-economic factors that contributed to the Arab Spring endure.\nWorld Bank data indicates that youth unemployed is more than double the global average, while according to the World Economic Forum youth unemployment across the region stands at 31 percent, five times higher than the adult average. University graduates constitute nearly 30 percent of the total unemployed.\nThe World Economic Forum set out unemployment by age in the Middle East.\nIn 2012, a year after the frustrations felt by many young people bubbled over and onto the streets, Booz & Company (now Strategy&) published a detailed report on the attitudes and behaviors of the Arab Digital Generation. In many cases, little has changed since this report was published.\nProduced with Google, and polling more than 3,000 digital users born between 1977 and 1997 in nine Middle East countries, they found a cohort with \"less traditional ideas about family, religion, and marriage\", and clear expectations and preferences for tech to enable greater e-government and e-commerce, as well as improved healthcare and education.\nAlthough progress has been made in these areas, more clearly needs to be done.\nWhat are the key opportunities and challenges?\nA key implication of the regions demographic timebomb, as the UNDP explains, is that \"the region needs to create more than 60 million new jobs in the next decade to absorb the large number of workforce entrants and stabilize youth unemployment\".\nElsewhere, in 2016, Sophie de Caen, acting director of the Regional Bureau for Arab States in UNDP, suggested that, \"Arab countries can reap the huge demographic dividend that its young population represents if they invest in enhancing the capacities of their youth and enlarging opportunities available to them\".\nASDA'A Burson-Marsteller's John is optimistic about the future, arguing that the UAE and Saudi Arabia will be catalysts for growth in the tech sector.\n\"Governments are aware they have to provide rewarding, fulfilling jobs for their overwhelmingly young populations. In the UAE, we've seen the cabinet appoint a Minister for Artificial Intelligence; Dubai has pledged to be the leading AI-driven administration in the world, and the first'blockchain government',\" says John.\n\"In Saudi Arabia, the sovereign wealth fund, PIF, has teamed up with Softbank to create a $100bn fund for tech investment, the biggest such fund of its type in the world. But Arab countries won't achieve these goals unless they address the core issue of education.\"\nJohn says across the Middle East, 29 percent of young Arabs identified modernizing the education system as one of the top three things that governments must focus on to move the region in the right direction.\n\"Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have woken up to that in recent years and have pledged greater emphasis on STEM education. But the region as a whole needs a focus on building a modern education system that can prepare the region's youth for the jobs of tomorrow,\" he adds.\nOne reason why this focus is needed, the World Economic Forum said last year, is that \"by 2020, 21 percent of core skills in the countries of the GCC and 41 percent of those in Turkey will be different to skills needed in 2015\".\nNorthwestern University in Qatar (NUQ) has undertaken an annual regional survey exploring media use patterns, content preferences, and attitudes toward topics such as censorship and digital privacy, freedom of speech and cultural preservation.\nA persistent theme from NUQ's studies is the variety of digital experiences across the region. It's an issue that John also alludes to, highlighting the mixed nature of digital progress.\n\"Businesses will see that there is huge untapped opportunity in expanding their services to reach young digital natives,\" he says.\n\"For example, just over half of young Arabs say they shop and bank online, with varying degrees of frequency. But that suggests that almost half are yet to embrace online shopping.\n\"And we see in the geographic splits that while GCC youth are more familiar with online spaces -- almost three-quarters have shopped and banked online and half have banked online -- in North Africa, around 70 percent have not used the internet for shopping or banking.\"\nThis chart shows the use of online banking and views about it among young Arabs.\n\"How people interact with technology always evolves. In media, we'll continue to see traditional media lose out to new channels,\" John argues.\nSpecifically, he suggests, we will start seeing more apps and services created by Arabs and for Arabs.\n\"We've seen e-commerce startups like noon.com move into that space; we have homegrown blockchain specialists starting to emerge, and, with the right investment and motivation, we'll see young Arab startups occupying spaces that have traditionally been dominated by Western companies.\"\nWorld Bank data indicates that the Middle East has one of the lowest levels of entrepreneurship in the world, with just one newly registered firm per 1,000 working age adults.\nYet, according to a 2016 survey produced by the World Economic Forum, one in two young Arabs identified creating their own business or working on an entrepreneurial project as a key area for potential empowerment.\nIt's an interest that John has also seen emerge through the Arab Youth Survey.\n\"This year is the first in which technology has emerged as the preferred sector in which young Arabs want to set up a business, chosen by 18 percent of those surveyed. In previous years, retail and real estate have always been the favoured sectors,\" he says.\nNavtej Dhillon, the former director of Brookings' Middle East Youth Initiative, argued back in 2008 that the youth challenge is the most critical 21st century economic development challenge facing the Middle East.\n\"In a region where almost 65 percent of the population is under the age of 30, long-term prosperity and stability hinges on the opportunities afforded to this generation.\"\nA decade on, that sentiment remains true. As the United Nations Development Programme explained last year: \"The Arab region is home to the youngest population in the world, with over 100 million young men and women between the ages of 15 and 29.\"\nMeeting the needs of this large, tech-savvy and often frustrated demographic is important for the stability of the region, as well as its growth.\nDigital technologies have exposed Arab Youth to new possibilities and global cultures, as well as enabling different ways of communicating, spending their time and interacting with the world around them.\nThey're a vibrant, digitally confident cohort, who will inevitably shape the future of the region. Doing the best by them will be essential if the region's full post-petroleum potential is to be unlocked."

        "text": "Worldwide Microdisplay market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 22.3% during the forecast period and reach value of US$ 5,782.6 Mn by 2027.\nAlbany, New York, Mar 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Albany, New York, March 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to a new research report on the global microdisplay market published by Transparency Market Research (TMR) the global microdisplay market is expected to reach value of US$ 5782.6 Mn by 2027, expanding at a CAGR of 22.3% from 2019 to 2027. According to the report, the global market is likely to continue to be influenced by a range of macroeconomic and market-specific factors in the next few years. In terms of demand, Asia Pacific is projected to continue to lead the global market, with the market in the region expanding at a CAGR of 24.8% between 2019 and 2027.\nThe global microdisplay market has witnessed strong growth over the last decade. One of the major drivers propelling the market is advantages associated with the use of microdisplays. Some of the significant features of microdisplay are high resolution and excellent image quality, low power consumption, and compact size. Generally, microdisplays are less than two inches in diagonal. In other words, their diagonal is approximately five centimeters. In addition, high-resolution microdisplays offer excellent viewing experience to users, which results in the increasing popularity of high-resolution display devices. These features allow the deployment of microdisplays in multiple applications ranging from consumer electronics to military, defense and aerospace. This, in turn, results in increasing popularity of microdisplays among manufacturers. This factor is likely to propel the global microdisplay market during the forecast period.\nThe global microdisplay market has been broadly segmented in terms of type, projection type, technology, end-use industry, and region. Based on type, the market has been segmented into reflective and transmissive. The transmissive segment was dominant, holding more than 50% share of the global market, in terms of revenue, in 2018. This can be attributed to the increasing penetration of LCoS and LCD technologies that the transmissive segment comprises. Furthermore, the segment is expected to expand at a significant CAGR of 21.3% during the forecast period. Growth of the transmissive segment is attributable to the large number of applications of transmissive microdisplays, which include near-to-eye displays (NEDs). In terms of projection type, the global microdisplay market has been divided into projection and near-to-eye displays. The near-to-eye displays (NEDs) segment is expected to expand at a high CAGR of 25.7% from 2019 to 2027, due to rising consumer inclination toward NED devices such as head-mounted displays and head-up displays. Based on technology, the market has been segmented into liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), digital light processing (DLP), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and others.\nThe OLEDs segment is anticipated to register the maximum CAGR of 25.3% during the forecast period. OLED displays are gradually replacing LCD displays in various devices including smart phones, smart watches, and television sets. This is primarily due to superior features of OLED displays compared to LCD displays such as wide viewing angles, large color gamut, and low power consumption. Based on end-use industry, the microdisplay market has been segregated into consumer electronics, health care, military, defense and aerospace, automotive, sports & entertainment, retail & hospitality, industrial, and others. The military, defense and aerospace segment is anticipated to dominate the global market during the forecast period. It held the maximum i.e. 29.80% of the market share in 2018.\nGeographically, the global microdisplay market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. Among regions, North America is anticipated to hold the maximum share of the global market, while the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to expand at the maximum CAGR during the forecast period. In 2018, North America accounted for 34.37% share of the global microdisplay market. This is attributable to early adoption of technologies and increasing adoption of microdisplays in the consumer electronics sector. Furthermore, the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to expand at a high pace between 2019 and 2027, due to presence of leading players such as LG Display Co. Ltd., and Sony Corporation in the region.\nThe research study includes profiles of leading companies operating in the global microdisplay market. Market players have been profiled in terms of attributes such as company overview, financial overview, business strategies, and recent developments. Some of the prominent players operating in the global market are AU Optronics Corp, eMagin Corporation, Himax Technology Inc., KopIn Corporation Inc., LG Display Co. Ltd, Microvision Inc., Omnivision Technologies, Inc., Sony Corporation, Syndiant Inc., and Universal Display Corporation. Companies are focusing on expanding their business through strategic acquisitions and partnerships."

Signatures would need to be submitted by early July.\nThis new vote comes after Ohio voters rejected a constitutional amendment in 2015that would have legalized cannabis. Voters rejected it because the amendment came with a requirement that all commercially sold weed had to be grown at 10 specified sites that had been promised to wealthy campaign investors. Ohioans did not want a monopoly on their weed cultivation.\nThe amendment certified by Attorney General DeWine does not limit grow sites, but allows the state legislature to regulate a recreational weed industry.\nThe amendment also allows people to cultivate their own cannabis without limiting how much can be grown or bought for personal use, unlike the 2015 amendment. It leaves the state’s medical marijuana program in place.\nOhio Families for Change seem pleased with the wording of the new amendment.\n\"It gives the small entrepreneur an equal footing with the cannabis conglomerates, while decriminalizing personal adult use of marijuana,\" Varner said in Cleveland.com.\n\"It goes beyond existing Ohio law to protect consumers from dangerous chemicals and pesticides that can be found in cannabis, and has stringent measures to keep marijuana away from persons under 21 years of age.\""

But is it up to us to stay safely anchored, or drift in the dangerous currents of anarchy,” Morales said.\nDompet Duafa, or “Wallet of the Poor” in Indonesian, is an organization that aims to promote transparency in the collection of zakat, an Islamic concept of mandatory alms for the poor. Represented by Ahmad Juwaini and Ismail Agus Said, the charity group began as a team of journalists taking part in a social mission to uplift the lives of Indonesian destitutes.\nJapan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers was launched in 1965, exactly two decades after Japan ravaged Asia during World War II, and hopes to “restore the trust” of the international community. Representatives Kimichi Kubota and Shinichi Kitaoka narrated how their community-based efforts and volunteer excursions alleviated social ills plaguing developing countries, such as the Philippines.\n“As we look forward to the next fifty years, we will continue to work hand-in-hand to promote grassroots collaboration, and further invigorate international trust and cooperation throughout the world,” Kitaoka said.\nHailing from an elite family, Thodur Madabusi Krishna inherited a rich musical tradition called Karnatik music, and as he shared his passion with his fellow Brahmins (ruling class in the Indian caste system), he noticed that impoverished Indians were prohibited from enjoying this genre of art. Since then, he distanced himself from performing at lavish concerts and instead sought to introduce Karnatik music to the Indian masses, children, and villagers in war-torn Sri Lanka.\nDivergent from Krishna’s fate, Bezwada Wilson was born from the Dalits, the lowest class of the Indian caste system. He was about to be destined to be a manual scavenger, just like his parents and ancestors, when he pursued higher and education and changed his destiny. Wilson launched the Safai Karmachari Andolan in 1993 and strenuously lobbied with the Indian government for scholarships for scavengers’ children, vocational training for female scavengers, and a total scrapping of manual scavenging.\nAside from the momentous awarding, Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo delivered a compelling speech about the legacy of her husband and former Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo, highlighting the time when he walked the same stage and received the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2000. Moreover, she also congratulated and cited the key achievements of the six Ramon Magsaysay awardees."

Each club is allowed five imports next season and Smeltz's decision to become an Australian citizen - he was raised on the Gold Coast - gives the A-League newcomers an advantage over their rivals.\nGold Coast already has three Brazilians - midfielders Jefferson and Robson, and striker Milson - and a Dutch defender, Bas van den Brink, on its books. It's believed the club had always planned to have Smeltz naturalised once it secured his transfer from Wellington Phoenix, and the player agreed when he was assured the move would not affect his international career.\nSmeltz, 27, is a key member of an All Whites side that will play in June's FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa and is preparing for a World Cup play-off against the fifth-placed Asian team later this year.\nAll Whites coach Ricki Herbert said last night: \"Shane let me know what he was up to and it's not going to impact on his future with the national team.

Cohen. Directed by Jason Hoover. Through Nov. 2. Ray of Light Theatre, Victoria Theatre, 2961 16th St., San Francisco. Two hours. $25-$36. www.rayoflighttheatre.com.\nTrain-wreck fans will be disappointed. \"Carrie the Musical\" is finally receiving its West Coast premiere in San Francisco, but there's little in the version at the Victoria Theatre to justify its fame as one of Broadway's all-time biggest flops. The Ray of Light production that opened Friday isn't exactly the same as the 1988 five-performance disaster - nor is it completely different - and it isn't that bad. Nor good.\nThis is the same authors' 2012 rewrite, which ran for a month off-Broadway. Lawrence D. Cohen, who adapted Stephen King's novel for the original Brian De Palma movie, reshaped his musical script to make it more intimate. Composer Michael Gore and lyricist Dean Pitchford (no, I'm not making up names) threw out and replaced a half-dozen songs.\nIt's a more compact, though still large, show, being given an enthusiastic outing by director Jason Hoover's earnest if uneven cast. Music director Ben Prince's adept sextet is only one guitar short of the New York ensemble. The stagings are ragged but generally effective, especially the special effect that caps the ill-fated prom. And it's well anchored by engaging high school junior Cristina Ann Oeschger as the telekinetic teen Carrie and a formidable Heather Orth as her frighteningly religious mother.\nIt's not Oeschger's fault that there's a big disconnect between the painfully shy outsider she plays so convincingly and the forceful notes she sings with dynamic conviction. Cohen's book works best for those who know the story well - no small number - jumping from one plot point to the next without connecting the dots. Carrie's discovery of her telekinetic powers seems to come out of nowhere.\nThe generic pulsating teen angst songs work best in full ensemble numbers, though choreographer Amanda Folena doesn't build on the raging-hormone energy of her opening. Courtney Merrell is aptly torn as the popular Sue Snell, who tries to befriend Carrie. Riley Krull embodies the entitlement but not the malicious edge of prima bully Chris. Much of the singing of the sappily sincere ballads is hit-or-miss.\nWhere Gore's score works best is in the operatic intensity of the mother's hymn-based arias. Whenever Orth assails her heights of religiosity, solo or in duets with Oeschger, this \"Carrie\" is riveting."

Or any judge.\"\nThe judge’s actions were especially incongruous given his track record of incarcerating juvenile defendants, according to local media. A Houston Chronicle investigation in October revealed that Devlin and Judge John Phillips accounted for more than one-fifth of all children sent to Texas juvenile prisons last year, sending them “younger and for less-serious offenses than the county’s third juvenile court.\"\nAnd even the people who are tasked with helping young men and women fight their charges were alarmed.\n\"I am baffled by why he did it,\" Harris County Chief Public Defender Alex Bunin told NBC News on Thursday. \"It's definitely not good for the kids in that they are being released without any conditions.\"\nBunin said he was worried about the kids released Wednesday, claiming that some of them had no parents or guardians to take them home at the time of their release and that others need support services like mental health treatment.\nThe public defender also said he is sympathetic to the district attorney's concerns saying the judge’s move could “endanger the public,\" according to a statement by Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg.\n\"Neither side is happy,\" Bunin said. \"This is different in that it’s across the board. It's just never been done without any consideration of the effect of the release of the child and the community.\"\nBut Harris County Juvenile Courts Manager Cindy Milom contested any portrayals of a \"mass release\" of defendants. She said only seven of 13 juvenile defendants who faced the judge Wednesday were released.\nMilom, who said the judge was on vacation and couldn't comment on decisions he made, is also pushing back on Bunin's claims expressing concern for the conditions under which the children were released.\n\"I really find that hard to believe because the public defender did not represent all the juveniles,\" Milom said.\nProsecutors told The Houston Chronicle that four of the kids released were facing aggravated robbery charges. Oakes will be revisiting the cases during a reset scheduled for Jan. 4, the Houston paper reports.\nThe ACLU condemned the judge’s actions Wednesday calling it \"improper\" and saying it was \"motivated by partisan interests\" or the \"result of his political loss.\" The organization has since called on the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct to launch an investigation.\n\"Judge Devlin’s mass release of children today, without any apparent concern for the children's safety or for ensuring that they are released to their parents, proves his detachment from the needs of each child,” the ACLU said in a statement.\nTexas’ State Commission on Judicial Conduct told NBC News Thursday that they cannot “confirm or deny” the existence of a complaint against the judge due to confidentiality rules in the state, according to Eric Vinson, executive director of the commission.\nThough Vinson declined to comment on specific facts involving the incident, the director did clarify that even an outgoing judge could be subject to an investigation.\n“A judge is subject to the discipline of the commission,” said Vinson, noting that the commission has the power to look at a former judge’s actions while they were on the bench.\nOakes responded to a request for comment on Thursday evening saying, \"I am out of town but from what I've heard I would not expect that from a professional.\""

Current city ordinance allows pets only at Sawyer Creek/Rusch Park and along the Oshkosh Riverwalk, as long as the animals are on a leash no longer than six feet.\nUnder the proposal, which the Advisory Parks Board approved, 7-1, during its June 13 meeting, domesticated animals would be allowed on walkways or trails or in parking lots that serve as such. Owners still would need to clean up after and have full control over their animals at all times. Pets still would not be allowed in city park buildings, playground areas, picnic shelters, sports or athletics facilities, beaches, zoos, pools, splash pads, golf courses, cemeteries or special events areas.\nOnly 12 of the city's three dozen parks have walkways or trails, Parks Director Ray Maurer said. While not part of the proposed ordinance, the Advisory Parks Board recommended making the changes on a two-year trial period.\nThe Oshkosh Common Council anticipates considering the proposal at its July 12 meeting, which starts at 6 p.m. at City Hall."

        "text": "One of the big launch titles for the PlayStation 4 is Digital Extremes' Warframe, a cybernetic space-ninja game that is uncontrollably addictive despite it's grindy nature. The title could have also been an Xbox One launch title, but Microsoft's policies regarding self-publishing from independent developers has made this somewhat impossible.\n\"We would love to see Warframe on Xbox One, the ball is in Microsoft's court with regards to allowing titles on their system that come from an independent developer and not an established publisher,\"\nThe “Microsoft won't let us self-publish” mantra has become a repeated phrase in an echo chamber throughout the gaming media circles. Unlike the last gen, many of the big movers and shakers this time around are independent developers – many of the original and creative games on the horizon are from independent developers.\nBlockading indie devs from self-publishing (unless they sign an exclusivity deal with Microsoft or have a publisher pick up the distribution rights) automatically limits what sort of games will be appearing on the Xbox One.\nNow, one of the common rebuttals against indie self-publishing is that a lot of indie games are “trash” and not of a very high quality. However, when you look at a game like Warframe, where the graphics (especially with a PhysX enabled card) looks better than anything currently on the Xbox 360 or PS3 when they're ratcheted up to the highest settings, at what point do we finally start saying that we need to take these guys and gals a lot more seriously in the industry?\nMany times the biggest factor between indie and AAA was graphical quality, but we're starting to see games from lesser known studios take visual and graphical risks that blur the lines between that distinction, and Warframe is obviously one of those games.\nNow, according to OXM and a few other Microsoft-sided sources, there are some things in the works to help the curating process so that indie devs may not have to jump through hoops to get their games on to an Xbox console. Microsoft at least did make some steps with waiving patching fees for indie devs, so it's not like we can completely rule out a change of heart regarding self-publishing as well.\nOver in the Sony camp things are the complete opposite of Microsoft regarding indie devs, development tools and policies. First up, none of the devs had a problem getting their hands on PS4 dev kits, opposite of the Xbox One. In addition to this, Sony has enabled Digital Extremes to even make use of the PS4's cross-platform functionality, so that PC and PS4 gamers will be able to play Warframe with each other. That should be very interesting.\nLast but not least, Sony allows indie devs to self-publish and bypass a lot of the hard-edged certification processes.\nFor Sony, this all means that we'll be seeing a lot more high-quality and creative indie titles on the PS4 compared to the Xbox One. Heck, Sony's E3 demonstration kind of pointed to the direction they're heading in, while Microsoft's E3 conference gave us a clear indication of what kind of guns they'll be packing."

        "text": "Clint Eastwood remains one of the giants of cinema because every performance just oozes integrity. Even as Eastwood aged, we, as an audience, got the sense that here was a man that refuses to compromise on the things that mattered. Rather like John Wayne you imagined that Eastwood spent his career playing a heightened version of himself.\nOver the space of 50 years we got the sense that Clint Eastwood, both on and off screen, was a man of few words but those that he did utter were very important.\nIn the political thriller, In The Line of Fire, directed by Das Boot film-maker Wolfgang Petersen, Clint Eastwood plays Frank Horrigan, a Secret Service agent who is haunted by his past. He is a member of an elite squad of agents charged with protecting the President of the United States. He was on duty the day that JFK visited Dallas and he still cannot forgive his shortcomings which allowed Kennedy to be assassinated.\nThe first thing that grabs your attention – and the most refreshing to be honest – is the fact that this is the first movie where Clint Eastwood plays his age. Although, this is a tense psychological thriller, Eastwood and Petersen allow themselves the time to poke fun at Eastwood’s advancing years.\nHe’s shown to be out-of-breath while running alongside the President’s motorcade and for a while he is made to look as if his time has passed. He is seen as a bit of dinosaur by some of his younger associates and when a female Secret Service agent Lily Raines, played with sharp-timing by Rene Russo, joins the Presidential protection squad, a few misjudged sexist quips seem to have him on his way to his retirement party.\nBut, experience does count for something and Frank Horrigan is not the misogynist pig that he appears. The President is running for re-election, he’s touring the country, glad-handing the party faithful, meeting the public and seducing the people with deep pockets so they will fund his campaign.\nWhile he is so visible, a mysterious figure wants to make a name for himself by killing the President and he wants to exploit Horrigan and his nightmares to do it. He plays mind-games with Horrigan during late night phone calls and gets the aging secret service agent jumpy, prompting him to sound false alarms, so further reducing his credibility in the eyes of his colleagues.\nHowever, the one person who stands by him and appreciates his instincts is Lily Raines. Unlike many films of this type, she is not interested in him romantically, but she enjoys being his partner protecting the President.\nIt seems that Mitch Leary, as the mysterious assassin calls himself, is a clever, master of disguise and enjoys playing a complicated game of cat and mouse with Horrigan and Lily.\nAfter Horrigan sounds a couple of false alarms, he’s taken off the White House detail, and has to rely on Lily to keep him up to date on the President’s movements and security arrangement while he tries to unmask the real Mitch Leary.\nWolfgang Petersen keeps the plot moving at a cracking pace, while still maintaining a wonderful degree of tension. As an audience you fed with tiny crumbs of evidence at the same time as Horrigan which means you are kept guessing right up until the last minute.\nHis real achievement as a film-maker is to create time for character-development during what is already atmospheric, incident-packed film. We see Frank and Lily slowly bond over this complex and twisted case.\nIt’s not a traditional romance but it is a superior-kind of buddy movie. This is a movie primarily-focussed on solving a case and laying to rest ghosts of the past.\nThe performances of all three leads are superb and no-one relies on cliché or caricature to keep the plot moving. These are three-dimensional characters and it is because you care about them is why the film is as effective as it is.\nEastwood and Russo unsurprisingly have the bulk of the screentime but Malkovich is never far from our thoughts. Mysterious Mitch is a huge, inescapable presence in the film. Malkovich relishes the opportunity to make him as creepy as possible and yet we still do understand what drives him. Wolfgang Petersen proved with Das Boot that he is a film-maker of real skill and this proves that he is equally talented in the thriller sphere.\nHe adds depth to the situation by allowing character to drive the plot and his flashbacks to the 1963 Kennedy years are brilliant. Dropping young Eastwood into the Dallas footage is a wonderfully convincing.\nThe film has a tough but satisfying conclusion but by the end we are ready for it. Like all good films In The Line of Fire works on many levels. It’s a first class thriller but it’s also a compelling examination of aging and the value of experience in the work place."

        "text": "Cathy Glasson: It's time to stop wasting our money on elaborate efforts to deny people care.\nThe caregivers in our union at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) got an ominous letter in the mail late last month. You can see it by scrolling to the bottom of this piece. It ordered them to send documents proving the identity of their spouses and children on the hospital’s health insurance plan. If they fail to do so, their loved ones’ coverage will be cut off.\nThe letter came from an outside consulting firm called HMS, which bills itself as a leader in health care “cost containment.” But this isn’t cost containment, it’s cost shifting. And the irony is that anyone UIHC does kick off its insurance plan may return to the hospital’s emergency room as an uninsured patient unable to pay for care.\nWe don’t want to just single out UIHC for criticism, however. Its self-defeating effort to cut costs is a symptom of the sickness that’s afflicting health care in Iowa and across America.\nRight now, UIHC and all of Iowa’s hospitals are being squeezed in a fiscal vise. Ever since former Gov. Terry Branstad privatized the management of Iowa’s Medicaid system in 2016, the for-profit providers that run it have been refusing to reimburse hospitals for millions of dollars in care. Last year, charity care — care for which hospitals aren’t paid — jumped 17.4 percent.\nNow, under Gov. Kim Reynolds, we’re hearing horrifying stories of Medicaid recipients being denied vital care. In April, the Register reported on a disabled 4-year-old forced to crawl because a private Medicaid provider wouldn’t pay for his walker. The state insists that these cruel cuts have saved Iowans money. But the Iowa Hospital Association says there’s “zero” evidence to support that claim.\nOn the federal level, the progress made under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being reversed. After its passage in 2010, the number of uninsured Americans dropped to its lowest level in history while the growth in health care costs fell dramatically, according to the New York Times. But now that Republicans are actively sabotaging the ACA, the number of uninsured Americans is rising once again and so are the costs for hospitals that must care for them.\nGiven the financial squeeze hospitals face, perhaps it’s understandable that UIHC is resorting to desperate measures to cut costs. But forcing Americans to jump through even more hoops to get health care isn’t working. The U.S. spends 17.2 percent of our GDP on health care, almost double the rate in the rest of the developed world.\nThe difference between us and them? Virtually every other developed country has embraced a single-payer system that’s far more efficient than ours. Those nations treat health care as a fundamental human right. It’s time to stop wasting our money on elaborate efforts to deny people care. Instead, let’s devote our resources to providing affordable quality care to every American whenever they need it.\nCathy Glasson is a registered nurse and president of SEIU Local 199, which represents 5,000 Iowa healthcare workers and public employees. She was a Democratic candidate for governor, finishing second in the June 5 primary."

Seventeen percent of Democrats said they would prefer newspapers as their only news source while 5 percent of Republicans made that choice.\nThe survey, which contacted more than 3,000 people and has a margin of error of 1.8 percent, revealed 38 percent believe news from the Internet is the most reliable, followed by television at less than half that figure – 17 percent. Newspapers were in third at 16 percent and 13 percent chose radio.\nThe poll said 49 percent of all respondents said national newspaper websites were very important and 43 percent said national television websites were important to them as a key source of news.\nA total of 41 percent said local newspaper websites were important sources while 34 percent said local television stations were the same.\n“That the websites of traditional news outlets are seen by a wide margin as more important than blog sites – most of which are repositories of opinion devoid of actual reportage – could be seen as an encouraging development for the media at large,” the report said.\nAnd forget Facebook and Twitter: Just 10 percent consider Facebook as important for news while 4 percent said the same of Twitter.\nEighty-two percent said they believe five years from now the Internet will be the most dominant information course. Television was second, at 13 percent. The survey showed that only one-half of one percent – 0.5 percent – said they thought newspapers would be the most dominant source of news in five years.\nIt was only a few weeks ago when WND reported its own 12th anniversary.\nWND began with the vision of its founders to create an Internet news source that would employ the highest standards and practices of the traditional American press in the world of the New Media.\nThat commitment is still reflected a dozen years later in WND’s mission statement: “WorldNetDaily.com Inc. is an independent news company dedicated to uncompromising journalism, seeking truth and justice and revitalizing the role of the free press as a guardian of liberty. We remain faithful to the traditional and central role of a free press in a free society – as a light exposing wrongdoing, corruption and abuse of power.\nThe ambitious undertaking was inspired by founder Joseph Farah’s 25-year career in the newspaper business – a career that provided him with the opportunity to experience virtually every job one can do in that industry.\nIn 1987, Farah got his first opportunity to serve as editor in chief of a daily newspaper in Glendale, Calif. For the next two years, he ran the News-Press and a small chain of suburban weeklies with a combined circulation of 250,000.\nIn 1990, Farah was recruited to be editor of the historic Sacramento Union, the oldest daily west of the Mississippi and the first newspaper to hire Mark Twain – then known as Samuel Clemens. Among its other notable alumni were Bret Harte and Herb Caen.\nIt was during his time in northern California that Farah became fascinated with new technologies emerging in the Silicon Valley during the pre-Internet era.\nInspired by the success of the DrudgeReport, the Farahs decided in the spring of 1997 the time to act had arrived. After experiments with less-ambitious websites that didn’t require daily updates, WorldNetDaily was launched, without fanfare, May 4, 1997.\nThe news site quickly emerged as one of the most popular in the world – voted so, in fact, every week for nearly two years running between 1999 and 2001 on the independent, European-based Global100.com."

        "text": "Earlier this week I took a nostalgic tour of New Orleans in search of the remaining works by renowned British graffiti artist Banksy, who visited almost exactly five years ago. I found that three of the original 14 stencil paintings can still be seen. A few others are boarded up or painted over. In four cases, the buildings where the paintings appeared have been demolished.\nThere’s a part of me that wished more Banksys were preserved. On the other hand, I doubt that the celebrated street artist intended New Orleans to be a museum; he intended it to be a social and political laboratory.\nAnother reason for Banksy’s popularity is, well, populism. Banksy’s street art is free and clear. There’s no museum exhibition admission, no gallery markup, no public art management fee, no profit. Behind the scenes, I suspect Banksy has done pretty well for himself in stencil sales – the New Orleans Museum of Art has a copy of the umbrella girl stenciled on canvas – but in public art terms he’s Robin Hood.\nAnd the realistic nature of Banksy’s designs eliminates any residual modern art snobbishness.\nIf you wander 2013 New Orleans searching for Banksys, you'll find a landscape in flux. The flooded green building on St. Claude Avenue where the patriot was painted is gone. So is the abandoned cement block barroom on Claiborne where the kid with the life preserver was painted. There are parts of town where Katrina and the flood are becoming distant memories. In much of the Lower Ninth Ward, it can seem like the disaster happened just days ago.\nWhile searching for the location of a lost Banksy, I noticed a house still marked with the spray-painted National Guard code that indicated a dead body was found in October 2005 (1 DOA, 10/15). That remains the most chilling sort of post-K graffiti.\nHere's a starry pop-culture collision that took place right down on Claiborne Avenue in the Lower 9th Ward. In 2008, Banksy painted his kid swinging on a life preserver very near the future site of Brad Pitt's modern architectural development, Make It Right. Coincidentally, Pitt reportedly spent $2 million on a Banksy painting at auction.\nThe blue corner townhouse on Oretha Castle Haley, where the gas mask band once marched is gone, replaced by a modern office building. The dilapidated and partially burned building near the corner of Canal Street and Sourth Derbigny, where Banksy painted his homeless Abraham Lincoln is also gone. In fact, almost everything is gone for a block in every direction, to make room for the forthcoming hospital complex.\nThis June, a Banksy stencil was cut from a London wall and sold at auction for $1.1 million. Too bad the New Orleans property owners couldn't have cashed in.\nI’ve heard that the ruined 7th Ward residence where Banksy painted his wind-blown horn player also is gone. But I can’t be sure because I never knew exactly where it was in the first place – somewhere near Poland and Claiborne Avenues, I was told. I also never laid eyes on the kid with an escaped umbrella painted on the Industrial Canal floodwall.\nBanksy's portrait of Bart Simpson on the abandoned hardware store at St. Bernard Avenue and North Robertson Street survived for years. Now it's boarded over. Renovation of the landmark Circle Grocery Store across the street seems to be in full swing.\nIn three former Banksy locations I visited, men were mowing very tall grass. The smell of searching for Banksys on their fifth anniversary is the smell of chopped sub-tropical growth. In one location, a goat baaaaed excitedly as I took photos. It’s as if New Orleans has become closer to the earth over the past five years – or maybe it’s just my imagination.\nThere’s a slight possibility, of course, that Banksy didn’t visit New Orleans in 2008 or anytime. After all, an outlaw guerilla artist must preserve his anonymity and can’t really take responsibility for his art. Since 2008, a handful of Banksy-like stencils have appeared on Crescent City masonry, giving rise to flurries of excitement. But knowledgeable Banksy watchers seem to agree that the 2008 visit was for real; the rest were imitations.\nHere’s a final irony: Banksy’s sinister anti-graffiti activist on the corner of Clio and Carondelet streets is still in perfect shape, although the strip of fuchsia paint that surrounds it visually smothers Banksy’s subtle design. And Banksy’s anti-graffiti crusader on the antique Jackson Avenue fire station near the river is in pretty good shape, though faded. That means two of the three Banksys that have survived the longest depict the anti-graffiti zealots that were supposed to be the bane of Banksy and by extension all street artists.\nThere may be some metaphor in that."

We were about to build the prototype when Mr. Gelb called to cancel the order.\nThough the contract is still in litigation, I can see his point.\nIn the summer of 2005, the soprano scheduled to sing the role of Cleopatra in a new production of Handel’s Giulio Cesare at the Glyndebourne Festival in Sussex, England, fell sick. Desperate, the management turned to a nobody: a 26-year-old of Dutch and Sri Lankan extraction, extracted from Australia at the age of 10, and raised in California. The youngest singer ever accepted into the Metropolitan Opera’s training program, she’d made her Met debut as Barbarina, to good notices, at the age of 19. Her name was Danielle de Niese.\nOn opening night, she ceased to be a nobody. Audiences roared themselves hoarse. Critics could barely keep their flies buttoned. David McVicar’s cheeky production—which transposed the action from the Roman Empire to the British and spiced Handel’s arias with dance moves from Bollywood, Broadway, and MTV—seemed custom-cut for de Niese’s outsized talents. In fact it was custom-cut for them, partly. When, in rehearsal, McVicar and his choreographer, Andrew George, saw what de Niese could do, they kept pushing the envelope: “Can you do this?” Invariably, she could.\nLip-syncing on MTV is a breeze; singing opera at full voice while dancing is not. Maintaining precise breath control can be agonizing (“My heart was beating in my throat,” de Niese says), and one has to shuttle constantly between the tight diaphragm required for dancing and the loose one required for singing. (By the way, this little problem gave the biophysicists on our design team a real headache; in the end, we had to spring for two diaphragms.) To be sure, de Niese did most of the really aerobic stuff during her arias’ ritornellos, or instrumental breaks. Even so, her feat was pretty stunning.\nThose of us who missed it because we were busy designing the perfect diva will have another shot next month, when the same production is mounted by the Chicago Lyric Opera. In the meantime, we can watch the DVD (BBC/Opus Arte). And we can listen to her debut album, a recital of Handel arias released this week by Decca.\nDe Niese’s backers believe she could bring a new generation to opera. I fully expect her to rope in several generations, including not only those who have reached puberty but those who are still watching cartoons. De Niese has the larger-than-life features of a Disney princess. Figuratively (by which I mean literally, with regard to her figure), she is a flesh-and-blood ‘Toon, a regular Jessica Rabbit. She is built for the theater, her every eye roll and lip purse reading loud and clear even from the nosebleed section. Yet the camera loves her, too, a fact first discovered by producers in Los Angeles who made her host of a children’s TV show when she was 12. (She won an Emmy four years later.) At a distance of 14 inches (the closest I got, on my honor), her eyes are so large as to be dizzying. Her mouth is constructed on a similarly queenly scale. When she sings or speaks her lips put on a show of their own, a bijoux ballet.\nWe tend to assume that the sort of opera most likely to attract new audiences is the sort written by Verdi or Puccini, in which characters behave in a relatively natural manner (e.g., singing continuously in long arcs of melody, often while dying). But it may turn out that older, more “artificial” forms, such as Handel’s opera seria, are a better draw. The plots may be convoluted, but they move in quick bursts of recitative, between which one can kick back and enjoy the arias. These resemble modern pop songs in (A) offering a snapshot of emotion, (B) being in ABA form, and (C) lending themselves to MTV treatment. And (D) just as the American popular song tradition, from the Café Carlisle to American Idol, allows one to “put one’s own spin on the standards” (in de Niese’s words), so does the return of the A section give ample room for creative ornamentation, which not only colors the music emotionally but “gives the singer a chance to show off, which I think modern audiences can relate to.” Since (E through H) Handel was probably, as Winton Dean remarks, “the greatest melodist in musical history” (think Messiah, then multiply by 23 oratorios, 50 operas, etc., etc.), you’ve got quite a songbook to work with.\nSince I may have given the impression that my admiration for de Niese rests on extramusical grounds, let me use her new record as a chance to test that hypothesis.\nDe Niese is an enchantress, of course. Her magic does not require that she be physically present; it works just fine on video. But if so much of it is visual, what happens when all she has to conjure with is her voice? Will the spell—transferred to a spinning circle—be unbroken? Or will her man come to his senses and escape?\nLet’s take the opening cut: ” Da tempeste,” the bravura aria Cleopatra sings when, having escaped dungeons, daggers, and a particularly nasty countertenor, she suddenly finds herself with Egypt, Caesar, and the known world at her feet. “If a ship, buffeted by storms, then reaches safe harbor, it no longer knows what to wish for.” In this foray into nautical psychology even so fine a Cleopatra as Magdalena Kozená falls short, incising a triumph so steely that one wonders if her dreadnought was ever at risk. De Niese, at a less frenetic tempo, conveys relief and a giddy joy: She’s on solid ground, but her legs are still shaking. In the repeat of the A section, where most singers just strut their stuff, de Niese uses ornaments as tools to dig deeper into the truth of the scene, striking gold with a spine-tingling cadenza. Compare the cadenza offered more than 40 years ago by one of the first Cleopatras on record, and to many ears still the best (of whom more later): It’s great fun, but empty of musical or dramatic sense.\nIf, on more plaintive numbers (such as “Lascia ch’io pianga,” from Rinaldo, de Niese doesn’t always sound the uttermost depths of sorrow, her youthful passion has a power of its own. Under, or somewhere near, the baton of William Christie—her conductor at Glyndebourne and elsewhere—the players of Les Arts Florissants partner her gallantly.\nA quibble: While on the Glyndebourne DVD de Niese’s voice is, like her person, luscious from top to bottom, on the record it seems just a tad uneven, with hints of glare in the upper or “cash” register (so called because it produces the “money note”); I trust this can be chalked up to close miking and to the acoustics of the Paris church in which the recording was made. Mostly, though, the voice remains fresh, delicious—and, yes, enchanting. At least for this victim, the spell holds. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that Decca has graced the CD booklet with an all-Danielle fashion portfolio worthy of Vogue.\nA young American singer takes the role of Cleopatra and is catapulted to instant fame. Sound familiar? It should if you paid the slightest attention to the recent obits for Beverly Sills, whose Cleopatrapulting took place in 1966. I’m not about to equate the two ladies vocally (love may be blind, but it isn’t deaf). Still, there are parallels worth drawing.\nOnstage and off, Sills came across as unaffected, even “natural.” But it isn’t possible to be natural in opera any more than in sword-swallowing. In Donizetti’s Daughter of the Regiment—a 1974 Wolf Trap performance taped for TV—her gestures and facial expressions are refreshing because they come not from opera buffa but from vaudeville and Hollywood. (She claimed she took her cues from Lucille Ball, but she reminds me more of Harpo.) Even in more serious roles, such as her sublime Manon, one sensed a light emanating more from the Great White Way than from La Scala or the Palais Garnier.\nDe Niese, too, oxygenates the opera house with acting that seems unoperatic—which is not to say it’s not stagey. She could be Cleoparachuted into a Hilary Duff or Lindsay Lohan flick, and no one would bat an eye, at least until she started singing; even then, her dance moves might well distract viewers from the fact that the notes were written almost 300 years ago by a man wearing a wig the size of a collie.\nSills, who could duet with Danny Kaye as gracefully as with Nicolai Gedda, made many Americans feel at home in opera for the first time. De Niese has the potential to be that sort of rara avis (as Julius would say): not a glitzy, bloated “crossover” star, but one who doesn’t need to cross over because she naturally lives in both worlds.\nI could be wrong, of course—in which case, Mr. Gelb, Galatea 1.0 is ready to roll."

        "text": "Air pollution could be more damaging to our health than previously thought, according to a new study, which found that prolonged exposure to dirty air has a significant impact on our cognitive abilities, especially in older men.\nAccording to the study published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, breathing polluted air causes a \"steep reduction\" in scores on verbal and math tests.\nResearchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) examined data from the national China Family Panel Studies longitudinal survey, mapping the cognitive test scores of nearly 32,000 people over the age of 10 between 2010 and 2014 against their exposure to short- and long-term air pollution.\nThe team found that both verbal and math scores \"decreased with increasing cumulative air pollution exposure,\" with the decline in verbal scores being particularly pronounced among older, less educated men.\n\"The damage air pollution has on aging brains likely imposes substantial health and economic cost, considering that cognitive functioning is critical for the elderly to both running daily errands and making high-stakes economic decisions,\" study author Xiaobo Zhang of Peking University said.\nCognitive decline or impairment, which could be caused by air pollution according to the study, are also potential risk factors in developing Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia.\nPollution exposure was measured using data on air quality, which includes three air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter.\nWhile the study adds to the already numerous health concerns regarding air pollution, it will be of particular concern to developing nations, whose smoggy cities could be hampering national economic development.\n\"The damage on cognitive ability by air pollution also likely impedes the development of human capital. Therefore, a narrow focus on the negative effect on health may underestimate the total cost of air pollution,\" Zhang said. \"Our findings on the damaging effect of air pollution on cognition imply that the indirect effect of pollution on social welfare could be much larger than previously thought.\"\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), nine out of every 10 people on the planet breathe air containing a high level of pollutants, with the worst affected regions being Africa and Asia.\nOf the world's top 20 most polluted cities, as measured by the WHO, all are in developing countries. Almost all cities in low to middle-income countries with more than a million residents fail to meet minimum WHO guidelines.\nCity dwellers aren't the only ones breathing in smog either, a study in January found that 75 percent of deaths related to air pollution in India were in rural areas.\nWhile some countries, including China, are taking measures to address air pollution, this will also potentially effect economic growth.\nMeanwhile, the wealthiest city dwellers are able to buy their way out of smog.\nIn Beijing, the rich are specially designing their homes and buying appliances to filter out pollutants in their air and water, while poorer residents are stuck breathing in the unfiltered smog, affecting not only their health but also, according to the new study, their cognitive abilities."

It will feature dancers, musicians, speakers and activities.\nKuumba Kids will perform on Sept. 10 to share the richness of African-American and African history and culture, said Bashea Imana, owner and creative director. This will include dance, step, puppetry and storytelling.\nThe educational organization, based in the Washington, D.C. area, has performed nationally and internationally, Imana said. This will be its first time at the York Fair.\n\"We're really excited about participating,\" she said.\nOver the years, the fair has received calls from artists and entertainers in the community who would like to showcase their talents, said Michael Froehlich, CEO of the York Expo Center.\nBut it often couldn’t accommodate the requests because the grandstand is reserved for big acts, and other stages already were full. Fair officials thought about it and decided to offer the community pavilion.\n“… a successful fair represents the interests of its community,” Froehlich said.\n“Fairs are about … educating people about their communities and about the various diversity that we have in our community,” Froehlich said. The hope is that fairgoers will visit the pavilion every day.\nOther free entertainment includes a firefighter training show; Rhinestone Roper, a Wild West variety show; Kona Ice’s Ninja Experience, which is similar to the popular “American Ninja Warrior” television show; and glass blowing demonstrations. The racing pigs and dogs will be back, too.\nAlthough it won't be free, \"Discover the Dinosaurs\" - an exhibit that includes the life-like prehistoric creatures and hands-on activities - will be in Mid Atlantic Industrial Memorial Hall East. There is a $5 charge.\nAttendees will see some of their favorite characters, including Elmo, Abby, Rosita, Cookie Monster and Super Grover.\nThe performances will be at 12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. on Sept. 8. Most fairs usually charge for the show, Froehlich said, but the York Fair decided to make it free.\n\"When people come, we want to give them the biggest bang for the buck we can,\" he said.\nThis year, the fair is welcoming 10 new food vendors. The offerings will include a variety of sweet treats, such as Penn State ice cream, salads and organic food made from scratch.\nLast year, some longtime vendors expressed concerns about attendance.\nKohr's Famous Orangeade, which had been a staple at the fair for years, decided not to return last year, citing dwindling attendance. After the 2017 fair, officials reported that attendance was 565,483 -- 10,231 more visitors than the previous year.\nAnother orangeade stand opened on the fairgrounds last year, and \"the sales were up -- up a lot,\" Froehlich said. He also said that gross food sale percentages have been increasing.\nVendors do not come back for a variety of reasons, Froehlich said. Those who have stayed over the years have done a good job.\nOne of the longtime vendors returning this year is The Belmont Theatre, formerly known as the York Little Theatre, with its steak sandwiches. The theater has built a new front for its stand, featuring its \"Belmont Steaks.\" It also has partnered with the Roosevelt Tavern, which will be offering craft foods.\n\"We're excited that we can continue the tradition,\" said Lyn Bergdoll, executive director of the theater.\nBen Supapucdee, who sells chicken on a stick at the fair, said he has had his regular customers over the 30 years.\nSome have complained about the admission price, and he has noticed that his line is longer when they can get in on a free day. But Supapucdee said he doesn't have complaints.\n\"As long as I make money, I don't mind,\" he said.\nCrews have been busy setting up rides, including a coaster.\nDeggeller Attractions is back with its rides.\nLast year, the Sizzler, a ride similar to the Scrambler, was shut down after several riders were injured. The ride operator made an emergency stop because of a mechanical failure, a state employee said at the time. The ride had passed inspection before operating.\nThe state Department of Agriculture oversees amusement ride registration and inspections. Each ride must pass inspection before it can operate, spokeswoman Shannon Powers said.\nRide operators also should be able to show proof that the rides were inspected and the date, she said.\nThe fair stays in close contact with the state Department of Agriculture, Froehlich said.\n\"Unfortunately, every once in a while, something happens, but we jump on it,\" he said. \"We're very cognizant of the fact that we want people to know that the rides are safe, and we want them to enjoy the rides.\"\nLast year the fair debuted a new agriculture education center, and it proved to be popular, Froehlich said.\nThe center allows people to learn about the state’s agricultural industry. Participants can milk a cow, walk in a grain bin, pet animals, watch the duck slide and listen to a book reading at the story barn.\nFairgoers also will be able to watch the livestock judging in the Utz Arena. The live birthing center will be back as well.\nIt's going to take some time, but fair management is still considering moving the fair to a date in July or August.\nMany state fairs have slowly moved their dates to the summertime because of school, Froehlich said. For example, the Delaware State Fair is in July. The Ohio State Fair is at the end of July and beginning of August.\nFairs held in the summer have some advantages, he said. It helps to increase the labor pool. College students and school personnel are looking for work.\nThe fair could open earlier during the day, and it would stay light later in the evening.\nThe York Fair, which has been held in September for about 75 years, has become more of an evening and weekend fair because of school.\n\"Hopefully in the future, you might see that change,\" he said.\nFroehlich, CEO of the York Fair and York Expo Center, will be retiring at the end of the year and after 40 years in the business.\nIn his 10 years here, he said management has tried to make the fair more customer-oriented, with such changes as widening the boulevards, adding more picnic tables and starting a fund for more on-ground acts.\n\"It's always felt like home here,\" he said.\nHis successor will be Bryan Blair, who was the general manager of the Elkhart County 4-H Fair and Agricultural Exposition in Goshen, Indiana.\nBlair currently is the chief operating officer at the York Fair and York Expo Center and will be shadowing Froehlich during this year's event.\nFor more information about the York Fair, visit www.yorkfair.org."

Sheary intercepted a Justin Abdelkader pass at Detroit’s blue line, cut into the middle of the ice, and used a Red Wings defenseman as a screen to score.\nWith the goal, Sheary now has a point in the last eight of 10 games. Sabres head coach Phil Housley mentioned what has changed in Sheary’s game as of late.\n“A little confidence. He gets that big goal in Columbus. That line for me has been really tenacious. They’re playing and the chemistry is forming. They’re getting some opportunities now. A lot more offensive zone faceoffs,” Housley explained.\nBuffalo’s second goal of the game came on the power play to make it 2-0 with 9:55 left in the middle period. Jack Eichel had a nifty play to set up Casey Mittelstadt with the goal. Mittelstadt was asked if he expected Eichel’s pass to sneak through.\nThe Red Wings would get the next goal of the game with just over two minutes left in the second period to cut the Sabres’ lead to 2-1. Detroit’s Dylan Larkin showed off his speed to get around the net and beat Buffalo’s Linus Ullmark on the wrap around.\nBut Buffalo wasn’t content with heading to the locker room with only a one-goal lead. Kyle Okposo took a pass from Rasmus Ristolainen on the power play and put it over the goaltender’s right shoulder to extend the lead to 3-1. That goal came 19:29 into the period and provided some insurance for the team headed to the locker room.\nOkposo’s goal was Buffalo’s second of the game on the power play. The PP unit has really turned it around this month. For reference, the team only scored one goal with the man advantage in January. They’ve already tallied five power-play goals in February.\nWith the team on the outside looking in of the playoffs, Saturday’s performance is one the Sabres will look to build off.\nBuffalo won’t have much time to rest, as they’re hosting the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday afternoon.

Clemens and Clinton and Harrison townships.\nIn January 2000, the elder Scandirito resigned as judge days before the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission planned to conduct a hearing on allegations that he offered five Macomb County women leniency in return for sexual favors, the Free Press reported.\nScandirito reported his father missing April 1, said Boca Raton Police Officer Jessica Desir. He said his father, of Boca Raton, was supposed to return home about 6 p.m. March 31, but never did.\nPolice began looking for the father and found inconsistencies in the timeline his son provided. His activities led police to the golf course at the former Ocean Breeze Golf Club, police said in a news release.\nIt stated that on April 4, human remains were found and later identified as the elder Scandirito by the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office. The son was identified as the suspect and arrested Monday while driving in Alachua County.\nArt Forgey, spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff's Office, said the younger Scandirito was stopped driving northbound on I-75 in a Toyota Prius with a stolen tag and dark tinted windows in the late afternoon or early evening Monday.\nForgey said Scandirito probably will be extradited to Palm Beach County, about five hours south, sometime this week. Desir said Boca Raton Police haven't released how the elder Scandirito died.\nA woman who answered the phone Tuesday at the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office said there was no information available. The chief medical examiner could not be immediately reached Tuesday.\nNearly two decades ago, the elder Scandirito faced removal from his judicial office in Michigan; and three of the women settled lawsuits against him, according to a Free Press report.\nHe had been a judge since 1991. He was a county commissioner from 1986 to 1988 and was a member of the county Planning Commission.\nClinton Township Supervisor Bob Cannon said he knew the elder Scandirito as a \"popular, gregarious judge\" who he saw at golf outings, sporting events and political parties.

Should an approval be granted by the Commonwealth Minister, it is highly likely to be appealed, which could delay the commencement of the project.\"\nFederal Environment Minister Greg Hunt is considering whether to approve a State Government plan to dump about 3 million cubic metres of dredge spoils west of the port as an alternative to a controversial plan to dispose of it at sea on the Great Barrier Reef.\nIn October, Mr Hunt agreed to a Queensland Government request to assess the project on \"preliminary documentation\", which streamlines the process.\nPremier Campbell Newman's Government reportedly wants to begin preparatory excavation work as early as New Year's Day.\nThe Caley Valley is a nationally recognised wetland and provides habitat for hundreds of species of birds, some migrating from as far away as the Arctic Circle.\nThe Newman Government has told the ABC about 150 hectares, or 2.5 per cent of the total area of the wetland, would be affected by the dredge spoil dumping plan.\nEnvironmentalists and the state Opposition have criticised the plan as rushed, warning that not enough is known about how the wetland will react to the development.\nThe Newman Government is keen to improve coal-handling facilities to kick-start the mining of coal reserves in the Galilee Basin inland of the port, where Indian mining giant Adani has proposed building one of the world's biggest coal mines.\n\"It's kind of an insane idea of really trying to satisfy the pressure from Adani to get this development going as quickly as possible because they've threatened to withdraw from the development if they're not dredging by 2015,\" Jeremy Tager, of the Far North Queensland Conservation Council, told the ABC.\nThe office of State Development Minister Jeff Seeney told the ABC that the dumping of dredge spoil on part of the wetlands was expected to result in \"impact, both direct and indirect, to migratory birds and the Australian Painted Snipe\".\nBut Mr Seeney said the plan included an offset of 1,400 hectares, many times more than the wetland area affected by the dredge spoil dumping.\n\"We will offset that with huge enhancement of the existing wetland,\" Mr Seeney said.\nIf there are other options that are less environmentally impactful, why is the Government taking the quickest option?\n\"We're using the dredge spoil as a positive, to enhance an area of port land.\"\nMr Seeney said avoiding dumping spoil on the Great Barrier Reef was \"the best outcome\" of the plan.\n\"Even though the permits were issued for [dumping on the reef], it was an emotive issue that people were not prepared to accept. So we've solved that,\" he said.\nUNESCO has repeatedly threatened to list the Great Barrier Reef as endangered, raising concerns about the potential impact on tourism.\nOpposition environment spokeswoman Jackie Trad said she would be surprised if the Commonwealth approved the plan.\n\"UNESCO is watching,\" she said.\n\"The independent experts have said there are other ways to expand the port. If there are other options that are less environmentally impactful, why is the Government taking the quickest option?\n\"What the Government has chosen is port expansion for one coal company, not a port expansion for the health of the region.\""

        "text": "The decision on 15 December 2005 in the case of Jones v Garnett was a victory for the taxpayer and a blow for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\nThe case concerned a husband and wife, Geoff and Diana Jones, and their company, Arctic Systems, which was set up in 1992. In common with family businesses' tax planning and on the advice of their accountants, one share was issued to Mrs Jones and one share to Mr Jones. The company was used to exploit the personal services of Mr Jones as an IT consultant. However, Mrs Jones did all the bookkeeping, liaised with the accountants and the bank, organised insurance, dealt with the contracts and dealt with other administrative tasks for around four or five hours an week on the company's business. Both Mr and Mrs Jones received a salary from the company, on which PAYE was accounted for. Mr and Mrs Jones received £8,400 and £3,600 per annum respectively.\nIn 1999/2000, dividends of £25,767.25 were paid to each of the shareholders. HMRC assessed that the dividend paid to Mrs Jones was income deemed to be the income of Mr Jones.\nThe settlements legislation is intended to prevent an individual from gaining a tax advantage by making arrangements which divert his or her annual income to another person who is liable to tax at a lower rate. In the case of Mr and Mrs Jones, HMRC claimed that by allowing Mrs Jones to be an equal shareholder and not drawing most of the income as a salary, Mr Jones had entered into arrangements which amounted to a settlement.\nThe Court of Appeal found in favour of the Joneses and said that the subscription by Mrs Jones for her share was a normal commercial transaction, so no settlement arose.\nThe court also noted it was important that there was no contract or obligation for Mr Jones to provide his services to the company at an undervalue.\nAs a result of the previous High Court decision, many taxpayers in a similar situation may have been advised to prepare and submit their self-assessment tax returns for the year ended 5 April 2005 based on the decision which has now been overturned by the Court of Appeal. This could mean that one spouse is paying tax on the other spouse's income.\nIf this is the case, you should'repair' the return based on the decision passed down on 15 December 2005. For the 2004/05 tax return you will have until 31 January 2007 to do this. However, as payments on account are based on the previous year, you may be making higher payments on account, so you should therefore make a claim to reduce these if you did not repair the return before 31 January 2006. Speak to your tax office about how to do this.\nFor taxpayers who self-assessed on the basis that the case would be overturned, no action is needed on their returns."

        "text": "Los Angeles (TADIAS) – Summer is officially here, and while everybody loves the sunshine, some of us are coming to terms with the fact that our New Years Resolutions never made it past January. This can bring on a sense of alarm as the layers of clothing come off, and may lead us to desperate measures (i.e.- drinking lemonade with berbere for 10 days). While these quick fixes are tempting, and may help us squeeze into an outfit for a special event, they aren’t sustainable.\nRather than beat ourselves up for not sticking with our New Years resolutions, we can look at summer as a time to recommit to our health and fitness plan. With the warmer temperature, we naturally crave lighter foods, making this a great time to transition to a diet with more fresh foods. In my own life, adding small manageable practices into my daily routine has been very fruitful (pun intended)! One of my favorite additions to my diet this year has been green smoothies, which I drink almost daily.\nWhile green smoothies may look a little like a failed attempt at gomen, they are delicious and have numerous health benefits. They are simply a liquid base blended with fruit and leafy greens. When consumed first thing in the morning, green smoothies give you a natural energy boost, and will help you get that summer glow in no time.\n*Chlorophyll aids in detoxification/blood purification.\nWhen I started experimenting with green smoothies, I simply added spinach or kale to my fruit smoothies. Over time, I’ve gotten much more creative, and tapped into recipes from Green Smoothie advocates such as Kimberly Snyder and Victoria Boutenko.\nI love the recipe below and make it every morning before work, modifying it based on what’s available at my local farmers market. I’ve shared it with my loved ones, and my co-workers and family members are all hooked. In fact, my 2 year-old nephew whips out his cup as soon as he sees me pull out leafy greens, and my office manager recently purchased a Vitamix blender for the office.\nA lot of these ingredients are probably already in your fridge (think salata minus the karya). Drink regularly and everyone will think you’ve just returned from vacation in Awassa or Bahir Dar!\nI am a green smoothie convert thanks to Nesanet (along with my 2 year old son)! Gomen for breakfast sounds scary, but it is actually delicious and does wonders for curbing all of the not-so-good for you cravings!\nNesanet, thank you! First, I must state here and now that there are MANY reasons to start green juicing, but I am going to list the reasons I have personally experienced: Able to consume a wide variety of produce, Assimilate nutrients faster, Promotes alkalinity – shifts body from acidic to alkaline, Youthful appearance, smoother skin, Encourages weight loss/control, Allows for efficient elimination, Improves energy level, etc, etc.\nHi Does any one know that teff is also used as an alternative health choice to wheat? Would love to explore that as well!\nGlad to hear you are seeing results Nunu and Keru!\nHeran-I highly recommend 100% teff injera-it tastes wonderful and is very easy to digest. I also make teff pancakes and cookies and they are delicious (I will share recipes in the near future). You can purchase teff at most Ethiopian markets, and Bob’s Red Mill Teff Flour is available in most health food stores."

        "text": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released guidelines today for automakers to build nondistracting electronics into cars, but fell short of passing regulations.\nRather than write regulations, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released finalized guidelines for automakers to build cabin electronics into vehicle that will not distract drivers. These guidelines come after a comment period on a draft release by NHTSA last year.\nNHTSA included its responses to comments and the new guidelines in a 281 page PDF made available on its Web site.\nIn justification of the new guidelines, NHTSA revealed that a recent test of distracted driving it conducted showed that texting doubled the risk of a'near-crash' over attentive driving. While the test found that manually operating a phone also increased the risk of a crash, NHTSA found no increased risk of crash when a driver engaged in a hands-free call.\nNHTSA's statistics also show that undue attention may be placed on distracted driving caused by personal electronics. Of crashes reported between 2006 and 2010, 17 percent were caused by distracted drivers. However, an average of a little over 2 percent of that 17 percent were caused by distraction related to an in-car control, such as a radio or navigation system. And an average of less than 5 percent of that 17 percent were caused by distraction from a portable electronic device, typically a mobile phone.\nIn many ways, NHTSA revised its initial guidelines in response to automaker comments, clarifying or doing away with some particularly onerous or ridiculous measures.\nThe initial release, by proposing no dynamic images visible to the driver, seemed to prohibit the use of modern navigation systems. Responding to objections by manufacturers, NHTSA clarified that it did not intend to mean navigation systems should have static maps. The new guidelines state that maps should not include'three-dimensional, photographic, full location scenery, and/or satellite images'.\nAudi, Tesla, and BMW offer navigation systems that do show satellite imagery.\nNHTSA justified its guidelines for less complicated map displays by citing a 1995 report on navigation systems by the Federal Highway Administration, apparently ignoring the great strides in technology made over the intervening years.\nAnother issue that arose from the draft guidelines was that cabin electronics, such as a stereo, should show no more than 30 characters on a text display, and that characters should not scroll. NHTSA based the 30-character restriction on guidelines from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA).\nAutomakers pointed out in comments that the JAMA guideline was based on Kanji characters, an ideogramic language where a single character can represent an entire word. A Kanji sentence of thirty characters could translate to an English sentence of 120 characters.\nNHTSA changed its recommendation to a general prohibition of text from \"books, periodical publications, Web page content, social media content, text-based advertising and marketing, or text-based messages.\"\nNHTSA intends to release two more sets of guidelines, considered Phase 2 and Phase 3 of its distracted driving recommendations. Phase 2 will cover portable electronic devices brought into vehicles, while Phase 3 will cover voice-recognition systems in vehicles."

The annual monitoring report released on 31 August at the UN Office at Geneva by the Cluster Munition Coalition revealed that the use of cluster munitions in war-torn Syria and Yemen has caused a lot of civilian casualties. Moreover, in those two countries, conflict and insecurity are hampering clearance of the deadly weapons.\nForces fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorist group in Syria are losing sight of the obligation to protect civilians as the battle to retake Raqqa from ISIL is being waged at the cost of their lives, warned the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein in a news release on 31 August. The High Commissioner called on all those with involvement or influence in the conflict to facilitate the rapid, safe departure of civilians wishing to leave Raqqa, and to ensure the protection of those who remain.\nIn a statement released on 30 August by the Office of the Spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng expressed deep concern at the deteriorating situation of up to 25,000 civilians trapped in Syria's Raqqa. He noted that civilians are used as human shields in this de facto capital of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da'esh) terrorist group under intense bombardment. Reiterating calls for a humanitarian pause to spare civilian lives, Mr. Dieng warned that as the offensive to retake Raqqa reaches its final stages, the fighting is likely to intensify and increase the risks faced by civilians still trapped in the city.\nCalling for creative ways to work towards peace in Syria, the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura on 30 August outlined the political path forward, which includes holding another round of the so-named Astana talks and behind-the-scenes efforts by the international community. Briefing the Security Council, he noted that the next round of what has become known as the'Astana talks' – between the Syrian parties in conflict and led by Russia, Turkey and Iran – will be held on 14 and 15 September. The special envoy also noted that the formal intra-Syrian talks in Geneva will take place later in October.\n“The UNICEF Representative in Syria, Fran Equiza, spotlighted what he calls the staggering impact of the war on Syria, with heavy fighting having displaced thousands of families around Raqqa city and Deir ez-Zour” said the UN Spokesperson at the noon briefing on 25 August in New York. Mr. Equiza just wrapped up a visit to camps in Areesha, Ein Issa and Mabrouka, where he met with displaced children. He said that he is overwhelmed by the profoundly traumatizing experiences children have been through, adding that they have endured brutal violence and lost friends and family members. The World Health Organization (WHO) said that it has been supporting routine immunization programmes which restarted in north-west Syria.\nThere are still 11 besieged areas, home to more than 500,000 people, where there is no humanitarian relief and no freedom of movement for civilians, said Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to Staffan de Mistura while speaking to the press in Geneva. He added that while eight of these areas had been reached by aid workers, three have not been reached at all. Mr. Egeland noted that the Daesh-held five neighbourhoods of Raqqa are the areas where the needs are beyond belief and where protection concerns are acute. Some 20,000 civilians are believed to be in these areas but there is no way for them to escape.\nIn 2016/2017, UNRWA and the EU partnered to run the My Voice-My School project and connected Palestine refugee students in Syria and Gaza with their peers in Germany and The Netherlands. An eye-opening experience for all involved, an opportunity to have a voice in the wider debate about education and proof, once again, that friendships can be struck beyond borders!"

Photograph courtesy of Smithsonian American Art Museum.\nPenn Quarter is home to historic and thriving cultural venues, offering everything from world-class plays to a cinema where you can sip a microbrew while watching an independent film. Here are some of our favorite places to spend an afternoon or evening in downtown DC—plus a look at events on the calendar.\nFord’s Theatre is one of the country’s most famous theaters thanks to its unique history: Abraham Lincoln was assassinated there in 1865 while attending a play. The theater doubles as a museum, with audio tours and talks most days. Onstage this month: Actor Edward Gero reprises his role as Scrooge for the third year in Ford’s production of A Christmas Carol, based on the Dickens story.\nWoolly Mammoth Theatre Company has a reputation for staging innovative, fresh-from–New York plays, such as Clybourne Park, which played at Woolly prior to its 2011 Pulitzer Prize win. Onstage this month: Catch the famed Chicago improv troupe Second City (alums include Mike Myers, Steve Carell, and Tina Fey) performing Spoiler Alert: Everybody Dies through January 8.\nDuring his 25 years with Shakespeare Theatre Company, artistic director Michael Kahn has given Penn Quarter two new venues: the 451-seat Lansburgh Theatre (450 Seventh St., NW) and the 775-seat Sidney Harman Hall (610 F St., NW; 202-547-1122). The company excels at classical plays, but it also takes risks with edgier works and regularly screens broadcasts from London’s National Theatre, such as John Hodge’s play Collaborators (December 19, $20). Onstage this month: Much Ado About Nothing, the much-loved romantic Shakespeare comedy featuring the sparring couple Beatrice and Benedick. Director Ethan McSweeny relocates the action to 1930s Cuba, with Latin music and lots of dancing. Information is at shakespearetheatre.org.\nAlthough primarily a music venue, the Warner Theatre hosts the Washington Ballet’s Washington-themed version of The Nutcracker from December 1 through 24. Set in a Georgetown mansion, the ballet reinvents the Nutcracker as George Washington and the Rat King as King George III; it also includes a Waltz of the Cherry Blossoms and a live orchestra.\nHoused in one of the most striking buildings in Washington—the historic Old Patent Office, now known as the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture—the Smithsonian American Art Museum is home to works by more than 7,000 American artists from the last 300 years. On the third floor, the Lincoln Gallery features contemporary artists such as David Hockney, Nam June Paik, and James Rosenquist. Downstairs, you can find works by Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent, and Georgia O’Keeffe. On view this month: “Multiplicity,” which looks at the art of contemporary printmaking. It runs through March 11.\nAcross the Reynolds Center’s glass-covered Kogod Courtyard, the National Portrait Gallery celebrates American icons and the artists who memorialized them with a collection of presidential portraits as well as works by artists ranging from Gilbert Stuart to contemporary painter Kehinde Wiley. On view this month: “The Black List,” photographs of prominent African-Americans by Vanity Fair contributing photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, through April 22.\nForget beat-em-ups and hammy blockbusters—Landmark E Street Cinema, with eight screens, specializes in indie movies, foreign films, documentaries, and cult classics. The theater has a concession stand with monthly beer specials as well as an espresso bar with pastries, cookies, and chocolates. Onscreen this month: Fridays and Saturdays at midnight in December, a rare chance to see 1930s and ’40s films on the big screen, such as Citizen Kane (December 2 and 3), King Kong (December 9 and 10), and Duck Soup (December 16 and 17).\nDecember 2 through 23, F Street turns into an open-air holiday bazaar during the Downtown Holiday Market. Nearly 180 craftspeople are showing wares from noon to 8 daily. In addition to antiques, fashion, ceramics, jewelry, paintings, and other crafts, the market features musical performances each day—from hip-hop artist Christylez Bacon to the Americana group North Meets South."

Then, 16 hours later, contracts can be negotiated and signed.\nWhat it means is that, starting at midnight on Saturday the 9th, reports will surface of agreements in principle. Technically, they’ll be unenforceable. And it’s possible that there will be some double dealing and reneging and other intrigue, with reports of agreements with one team leaked in order to push other teams to getting deals done.\nRegardless, the real negotiations will begin at or about the Scouting Combine later this month. That’s when the illegal tampering always begins, and everyone does it.\nAnd they’ll continue to do it unless and until some unlucky team gets caught and receives the bounty treatment, absorbing a penalty so significant that it scares everyone else straight.\nMy money is on the Ravens and Redskins, not for anything they did but for winning titles that in the mind of The Great Roger Goodell belonged to his beloved Patriots and Giants, respectively.\nI say this somewhat in jest–but wouldn’t be surprised if it happens that way.\nGood thing about being a Bear’s fan is nobody wants our players so tampering isn’t an issue….."

The senior boys lost a thriller in double-overtime 60-58 to first place St. Mike’s, lost to Chatham-Kent 53-38 and Stratford Northwestern 60-52 and defeated Strathroy Holy Cross 50-34.\nAgainst St. Mike’s the juniors played great on both ends of the court but struggled to score late in the game leading to the loss. Tanner Dietz and Bradley Boville led the way with 10 points each. The boys got off to a great start against Central Huron as all team members saw lots of playing time in the Blue Devil victory. Boville (with 12 points), Kyle Eisler (nine) and Aiden McMann (eight) led the offense.\nThe seniors, meanwhile, played a fantastic game against unbeaten St. Mike’s. The team led the entire game by as many as 15 points but several turnovers late in the fourth quarter led to a buzzer beating, game-tying three-pointer by St. Mike’s that sent the game into overtime. Again, the Blue Devils led by as many as five points in overtime but once more the Warriors scored late, sending the game into double-overtime where both teams shared baskets before St. Mike’s went up by two points for good. Kayden Vosper, Karsen Eisler and Alec Murray led the way for the Blue Devils with 18, 18 and 17 points, respectively.\nIn the annual Woodstock St. Marys tournament this past weekend, the seniors lost to the eventual tournament champions from Chatham-Kent in the opener. The game was tied at 13 after the first quarter but the boys failed to keep the pace as they would lose by 25. Jack Dixon led the way offensively with 12 points while Murray, Kyle Eisler and Karsen Eisler chipped in with eight points each. Against Holy Cross the boys played fantastic defense in the 16-point victory. Vosper led the offence with 11 points while Karsen Eisler added nine. The Blue Devils were matched up against Stratford Northwestern for the consolation title and the boys again played well for most of the game (tied at 42 after three quarters) but a mid-fourth quarter lapse saw the Blue Devils fall behind by 10 points against the great shooting Huskies and the team would eventual lose by eight. Noah Price played his best basketball of the season as he poured in 18 points while Dixon chipped in with 10.\nNext action for both teams is Saturday, Feb. 2 at MDHS as the seniors play host to Woodstock CASS and Kitchener Rockway in a pair of exhibition games while the juniors will play Walkerton Sacred Heart."

        "text": "AS the Gulf war enters its third week, Jordan's King Hussein is coming under enormous international and domestic pressure which is pulling him in two different directions. On the one hand, according to Jordanian officials, the country's refusal to support the coalition forces arrayed against Iraq is leading Jordan's already weak economy toward collapse. At the same time, popular pressure to give more support to the Iraqi people is growing.\nSo far, the king has successfully reconciled two difficult objectives: keeping his country out of the war and remaining firm in his opposition to the coalition attacks on Iraq.\nThe most serious form of pressure, Jordanian officials believe, was the attacks by coalition planes early last week against Jordanian civilian vehicles and nine oil tankers on the highway between Baghdad and the Jordanian border. The government said four Jordanians were killed and several injured.\nForeign Minister Taher al-Masri protested the attack to the United States ambassador in Jordan, describing it as a violation of the Geneva conventions. ``We have an agreement with the United Nations that excludes [oil] imports from Iraq [because of an international embargo],\" he told parliament. The UN has approved oil imports from Iraq despite the embargo, although officials in Amman yesterday reportedly requested that Syria supply the oil.\nMr. Masri, however, said that Jordan will not change its position on opposing the attack against Iraq. ``If this [attack was] intended to make us change our position, it will not..... We will keep to our principles,\" he vowed.\nAlthough officials say Jordan is trying not to be drawn into the war for fear of an Israeli invasion, Masri warned that Jordan reserved the right to fight back if air raids against civilians and oil tankers were repeated.\nAnother means of pressure Jordan believes it has been subjected to has been the decline of foreign financial aid to the kingdom. Officials say that Jordan has not received any of the pledged aid from European countries while the US and Saudi Arabia - once its two main financial backers - have stopped the flow of aid to the country.\nJordan's only port of Aqaba is under de facto blockade by US and other coalition navies. Jordanian officials say the country is finding it difficult to secure the import of food stuffs and medicine as importers fear the goods will find their way to Iraq.\nReal wages have been cut to one-third of their value; unemployment stands at 15 percent and is expected to reach 40 percent; many factories have reportedly closed down. Remittances from Jordanians working in the Gulf states - which once constituted 80 percent of foreign-currency income - have halted.\n``This is a bankrupt country,\" says an Arab diplomat.\nOn the other hand, as the raids against Iraq continue many Jordanians feel that King Hussein should take practical steps to help Iraq and some are even pressuring the government to engage actively in war.\nAccording to analysts, political enthusiasm for Iraq by far overrides frustrations at the rapidly deteriorating standard of living.\nAll sectors of Jordanian society and Palestinians in the refugee camps have engaged in the fund-raising campaign. Specifically, people are sending trucks of milk, flour, and medicine to Iraq, while Jordanian physicians are volunteering to serve in Iraqi hospitals.\nJordan's political groups and professional, students and women's unions, launched a series of solidarity activities with Iraq across the kingdom last week. Organizers said that demonstrations, sit-ins, fund-raising campaigns, and seminars will continue as long as the coalition forces bomb Iraq.\nAnalysts say the surge of pro-Iraqi activities in Jordan was triggered by Iraq's ability to hold out after two weeks of intensive air attacks. The euphoria that has swept Jordan, according to political observers and analysts, contrasted with the state of shock that prevailed in Jordan during the first days of the war.\n``We felt paralyzed and shocked, we could not believe that Baghdad was being attacked,\" says Reem Khalil, an executive secretary.\nBut when Iraq held out, the mood changed to one of defiance.\n``You have to remember that this is the first war in modern history in which Arabs have not been defeated after six days,\" says Jamal Shaer, a former Jordanian minister.\nThus, for Jordanians and Palestinians, the confrontation between the coalition forces and Iraq has emerged into the long-awaited battle with Israel and assertion of Arab independence from US influence.\nIraqi President Saddam Hussein has captured the Jordanian imagination with his missile attacks against Israel. Jordanians who watch Israeli television say that they feel that finally an Arab leader has been able to hit back at Israel.\n``For a long time, Israel was using its military supremacy to silence Arab reaction..... It is their turn to taste the bitterness of fear and suffering they have inflicted upon us,\" says Mansour Muhammad, a Palestinian refugee."

Sen. Tom Davis (R-Beaufort) and Rep. Peter McCoy (R-Charleston) spoke about their medical marijuana bills at a press conference after it was introduced on the State Senate floor.\nSen. Davis said this is the most socially conservative medical marijuana bill in the country. He doesn’t want it to lay the foundation for recreation use in the state. “Each step of the process – from the growing to the processing to the dispensing is monitored in real time constantly by DHEC and SLED,” Sen. Davis said.\nSen. Davis shared some details on the Compassionate Care Act while surrounded by members of both parties in the House and Senate.\nThe Compassionate Care Act is proposing the use of medical cannabis for people with certain debilitating medical conditions. Those include: cancer, multiple sclerosis, a neurological disease, PTSD, glaucoma, Crohn’s disease, sickle cell anemia, ulcerative colitis, wasting syndrome, severe nausea in a person who is in hospice care, chronic medical condition causing severe muscle spasms, including multiple sclerosis: or “chronic or debilitating diseases for which an opioid is currently or could be prescribed by a physician based on generally accepted standards of care.\nSome other provisions say certifying physicians must complete training that is specific to medical cannabis.\nAnother provision said smoking of cannabis is not allowed. It may only be used by patients in the forms such as vaporized flower or oil, gel caps, suppositories, patches, edibles or topical cream.\nSen. Davis said the medical cannabis will be tested by an independent testing lab to make sure it is safe and properly labelled.\nSupporters say a benchmark research poll shows 72 percent of South Carolinians support medical marijuana. Others argue against it saying CBD oil is already legal in the state so there’s no need for medical marijuana.\nTwo days after a New York Times report uncovered several issues with production at the North Charleston Boeing facility, one man quoted spoke on camera with CBS News."

        "text": "Respawn should reveal some new info about its upcoming projects--could it be Star Wars?\nRespawn will be a part of EA's big E3 press conference in some way, but details are still nebulous.\nNew information on an upcoming project will be teased at tomorrow's EA Play, Respawn's Vince Zampella today confirmed. Respawn, now owned by EA after being acquired for $315 million, is currently developing three major games: a new war-based VR game, a narrative-driven third-person action Star Wars game, and Titanfall 3. Which one could be teased? We're hoping for the middle one.\nFollowing Battlefront II's big lootbox controversy and Visceral Games' closure and the cannibalization of its interesting-sounding Star Wars project (aka Project Ragtag) the Star Wars gaming market has been pretty slim. EA's exclusive license to make Star Wars games has been stretched out now that the timeline has been disrupted. Project Ragtag was to release in 2018, and Respawn's game was to launch in 2019 or 2020 (EA's FY2020 and FY2021, respectively). Considering the Star Wars game is Respawn's highest profile game in development it's possible we could get more concrete info about it at E3 2018. However the VR war game is to release in 2019...so it could be that too.\nIt's been a while since we last heard about Respawn's Star Wars game.\nWe know that it's a third-person action game with very heavy emphasis on characters, and that it'll follow true to the Star Wars universe while also exploring brand new territory.\n\"I would sacrifice visual fidelity for gameplay experience. It has to feel good. It has to play right. It has to be fun,\" Respawn Entertainment co-founder Vince Zampella told Glixel in 2016.\nBut it's not all fun and games - we promise to pay respect to the Star Wars legacy at all times, a fact that will be constantly reinforced and honored as a central game design tenet. Fans should expect the exemplary level of quality first established at Respawn with Titanfall, a game that epitomizes our studio's dedication to slick, larger-than-life action and fun, groundbreaking mechanics.\nWe'll be making a third-person action/adventure game set in the Star Wars universe.\nAs a huge Star Wars fan I'm itching to play some quality narrative-driven RPGs...and I hope Respawn can deliver sooner than later.\nEA's big E3 showcase starts at 2PM EST tomorrow. Be sure to tune in for new info on something Respawn-related, Anthem, and Battlefield V (among others).\nBut, we figured out a juicy little tidbit to mention about 1 of the 3 projects tomorrow at #EAPlay2018 (@andrearene threatened to force something out of me)."

And he explained why when he called back this afternoon.\n\"I've got stuff from all over the world about fluoride -- who uses it, who doesn't,\" he said. \"The people who don't use it have better dental records [than we do]. People just don't know about it. All I was trying to do was find us some money. I found us a million dollars, and nobody wants to take it. People need to hear about it. Like they say, it's a drug they put in our water -- and it's also not that good. It's not even pharmaceutical grade.\"\nOriginal item posted at 11:20 a.m.: We haven't been able to reach Sheffie Kadane this morning -- he's at a meeting in Arlington -- and his secretary says she's unable to access his schedule at the moment. So, long story short, we cannot confirm his advertised attendance at a meeting scheduled tonight at Winfrey Point at White Rock Lake on E. Lawther Drive. But it does sound very much like something up his alley: \"The Town Hall on Fluoridation.\"\nKadane, you may recall, believes Dallas needs to get the fluoride out of its water supply. He's said it a few times during recent council meetings, nodding along with he anti-fluoridation faction that keeps popping up to do a few sets at the open mic. The District 9 rep who's about to get term-limited out of out of office has fought against fluoride on two fronts: We don't need it, he insists, and we shouldn't be paying for it -- especially since adding more to the city's water supply runs around $600,000 annually.\n“Have you seen toothpaste that has fluoride in the toothpaste?” he asked Dallas Water Utilities officials in May. “Have you read the disclaimer which says do not swallow, and if you do swallow this toothpaste go get your stomach pumped? And it’s only on the fluoridated toothpaste.” Anyway. We're not sure if he'll be there. But it does seem like his cup of non-fluoridated tea.\nBut we do know who will be there: Dr. Paul Connett, the executive director of the Fluoride Action Network and a former chemistry professor billed as \"one of the world’s experts on Fluoride.\" He's certainly one of the most controversial, as evidenced by his brief entry on Quackwatch: \"Fluoridation is supported by major health organizations and government agencies throughout the developed world and has been listed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among the 20th Century's ten great public health achievements. But Connett would have you believe that fluoridation is ineffective, unsafe, and unethical. In effect, he would like you to believe that he's smarter than all of them put together.\"\nHe actually spoke to the council in June, where he was warmly greeted by none other than Sheffie Kadane. Their back-and-forth is below, beginning at the 3:40 mark. Just in case you can't make it tonight."

        "text": "There’s significant debate of late about the public’s “Right to Know” certain data about public figures. Less contentious, but no less real, is a wave of debate about the public’s expectation that the businesses they favor not only have a right to know their likes and dislikes, action and reactions, but also an obligation to know, as well as act on that knowledge.\nFacebook and other advertising platforms have run afoul of their consumers not so much in how they collect data or even how much they collect, but rather in hoarding it for their own purposes and financial gain without sharing the benefits with the data creators themselves. The quid pro quo covenant seems to be broken. Consumers give data. Businesses get richer. That’s not how it should work in many consumers’ eyes.\nThe best marketers, however, are successfully straddling that line with amazing critical and financial success. These marketing platforms aren’t sentient exactly, but “wicked smaht” as they say in Boston. Very smart and technically sophisticated, but also adept in their understanding of human behavior. Many, many people will give information in order to receive the benefit of that information — Siri, what’s on my calendar today?However, if they’re not benefitting, they’ll turn on the businesses that are profiting off of their data in myriad ways — all of which erode loyalty, profitability, and even credibility.\nBetween being ‘spied on’ and being treated exactly the same as everyone else is a commonsensical middle ground that respects the individual’s privacy while collecting relevant data. It sees meaningful behavior without stalking. People don’t want to be treated as a faceless ‘impression’ in marketing any more than they do elsewhere. Nor do they want to hear from Alexa, “It seems you’ve gained a few pounds. Should we cancel the recurring Doritos order?” It’s vaguely insulting to have complete understanding that you’re generating data breadcrumbs, virtually every second of the day between your phone, connected devices, cookies…and precious little of that data makes its way back to you in the form of better quality personalized experiences.\nPeople aren’t feeling abused, oppressed or put upon in anything near the order of magnitude they are in the ‘real world.’ Not even close. They are, however, feeling like they have options. Like they’re mad as hell and not going to put up with it anymore. If you can’t treat them with respect, somebody else will.\nWhat began as a wave of privacy concerns in the EU could be a tsunami of issues here if not handled deftly. Doing so has a technical component. Software can act as the connective tissue between data pools, bringing each individual customer’s data into a single intelligent source for that same customer’s next interaction — a more informed, intelligent, and contextually relevant one. Brands that do this will find more inspired, informed, and loyal customers in return.\nBrands that fail to invest in modern marketing architecture and maintain a ‘doggie door’ for data, where it comes in but never gets put back out in intelligent form, will suffer the inverse — high churn, low satisfaction, and higher customer acquisition costs to futilely attempt to patch their leaky buckets.\n1. Do you have the people to ‘play fast?’ Data is always being gathered. Can your talent transform it into the heart of engagement in a timeframe where the customer feels the benefit?\n2. Are you Outside In or Inside Out? It’s funny how many people say, “The customer is the boss. The customer pays all our bills….” yet the culture they’ve created is insular, territorial, and more concerned about their personal performance than the customer’s experience. If the customer is not at the center of your entire organization, you need to rethink structure.\n3. Are your muscles too big? Muscle memory is a powerful thing. When people have had success doing things one way, they’re often times very challenged to do it differently. This is particularly true of high performers in my experience. If someone has used a meticulously crafted annual planning calendar to magnificent effect in the past, they may be unable to change to a more agile, just-in-time way of working — even if they’re willing. Clayton Christensen has written very powerfully on this dynamic.\nI don’t envision people taking to the streets to push back against superficially judgmental marketing. I do think people are feeling neglected, maybe even taken advantage of when it comes to marketing, however. With the proper tools and the right attitudes and aptitudes to use them, any business can prove it values its customers. It’s not an act of heroism. It’s just the right thing to do."

        "text": "Recent studies of the whole human genome have proven that the entire population of Ashkenazi Jews in existence today descended from no more than 350 individuals who lived 800 years ago. The genetic similarities among members of this sect were found to be so acute that everyone in the community is, at the very least, the 30th cousin of everyone else. This level of consanguinity only occurs when a relatively small community is kept isolated for geographical or social reasons resulting in large scale and persistent in-breeding. Population bottlenecks such as this have been observed among the Finns, the French Canadians in Saguenay–Lac-St.-Jean, and in orthodox religious groups such as the Amish and the Hutterites.\nCommunities with population bottlenecks are highly susceptible to genetic diseases. The Ashkenazi Jews, for instance, commonly suffer from Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis and Gauchers disease. Due to a historically high reproductive rate among the relatively small number of individuals that comprise the community, rare mutations that might have been dormant in founder individuals begin to express themselves over time among their descendants, with dramatically increased frequency the longer the community remains endogamous.\nMutations, of themselves, are not uncommon in the general population. When an offspring inherits a copy of a recessive gene from only one parent, it could go through its entire life without displaying any symptoms of the disease. It is only when a child inherits a copy of the same mutation from both parents that the disease surfaces. In communities with population bottlenecks, there is a significantly higher chance that both parents will carry the same recessive mutation.\nA number of inherited diseases have been identified to commonly exist in various Jewish communities such as the Ashkenazis. As abortion is generally unacceptable among orthodox Jews, prenatal screening is largely ineffective as a means to prevent affected foetuses from going to full term.\nTo work within these religious constraints, Rabbi Josef Ekstein, a New York Jew, established Dor Yeshorem in 1983. The organisation used genetic techniques to screen members of the Jewish community from as early as when they were in high school, hoping to identify those that carried recessive genes for Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis or Gaucher’s.\nArmed with information about their own genomic mutations, these schoolchildren were now equipped to determine, even before they started dating, whether the offspring they might have with the persons they intended to date are likely to be afflicted with one of these diseases. As unromantic as this might sound, in communities with rigid religious and social norms, genetic matchmaking is perhaps the only way to avoid the proliferation of genetic diseases.\nIndia is home to more than 40,000 jatis as well as various other tribal groupings. Many of these groups follow, to this day, strict rules of endogamy that prevent them from, or at the least frown on, marrying anyone outside their group. We have only relatively recently begun to test these groups for genetic similarity.\nEarly results indicate that genetic differentiation between groups in India is likely to be as much as three times higher than differentiation within populations in Europe. This is a clear indicator of the existence of population bottlenecks in India similar to those among religious sects in the West.\nAs population bottlenecks are themselves indicators of genetic disorders, it stands to reason that the endogamous populations of India are likely to be rife with inherited diseases. However, as there has been little systematic research into identifying the genes responsible for disorders common to Indian endogamous groups, not much is known about which groups are likely to have what mutation. The little that we do know indicates that this is research worth doing.\nFor instance, we know that there is a high probability that Vysyas carry a recessive mutation in their genome that results in reduced levels of butylcholinesterase in their body. If anyone with low levels of this protein is given anaesthesia, there is a good chance that they could go into prolonged, potentially fatal, muscular paralysis. No doubt numerous other such genetic insights will surface if we begin to look for them in other endogamous groups. A good proportion of these insights could well mean the difference between life and death.\nWith the rapidly falling cost of sequencing the whole human genome, it should be relatively easy to undertake a widespread genetic analysis of all the endogamous groups in India to correlate genetic markers unique to those specific groups with symptoms that have a high rate of occurrence. This will give us a significant opportunity to improve medical outcomes by simply studying rare recessive traits in specific communities.\nIf we can make progress in this direction, we should be able to introduce genetic matchmaking into the arranged marriage workflow so that along with horoscopes, parents are encouraged to match whole genome reports to ascertain whether their as yet unborn grandchildren run the risk of inheriting deleterious double recessive mutations. Or perhaps someone will build an app that automatically incorporates your genetic report into your online profile and only allows you to swipe right if the person you are about to “like\" is genetically compatible."

        "text": "Writing apps Scrivener, A Novel Idea, Persona: Tech to boost productivity and creativity.\nWriting apps can make you more productive. Can they make you more creative?\nPersona, like other fiction-writing apps, helps you organize your ideas to enhance productivity.\nMicrosoft Word can sometimes feel like the place where creativity goes to die. Its icons evoke the wan cubicle world of ’90s office culture: impassive clipboards, boring scissors, a squat dour printer. (And don’t get me started on Google Docs.) Word’s corporate vibe makes it a less-than-ideal sanctum for novel writing, or really any kind of imaginative writing, and perhaps that’s why a new crop of apps has emerged to help today’s underserved Woolfs and Melvilles find literary greatness.\nThe fiction-writing app is a curious creature, because it can only sell creativity by downgrading it. It operates outside of the traditional, mystery-swathed model of inspiration, in which brilliance floods down on us from heaven, and instead reduces invention to a series of steps. In lassoing and regimenting the muse, fiction apps evaporate some of writing’s pain, but also some of its glory. Or maybe they just help us procrastinate! Either way, we’ve rounded up a few of the digital aides available to seekers of literary immortality as well as those of you who really, really hate Word.\nA Novel Idea gives you a sketchbook where you can fill in details related to your story.\nSimilar to A Novel Idea is yWriter5, the brainchild of designer, programmer, and science-fiction author Simon Haynes. This free program cordons your opus into discrete chapters, each of which you can annotate with four types of metadata: “character(s),” “goal,” “conflict,” and “outcome.” Drag and drop chapters around a “storyboard” to get a visual sense of the overall structure and, for a healthy dose of stress, set yourself a deadline with reminders of what needs to get accomplished every day.\nYWriter5 cordons your opus into discrete chapters that you can annotate with metadata.\nThe Persona app allows you to generate a freestanding database of possible cast members in order to “organize and centralize your character data” around “archetypes” you’ve designed. You might, for example, make a folder full of buxom blond ex-wives, or exacting-but-warmhearted teachers, or quirky anomic Brooklynite twentysomethings, or struggling tech-savvy genius authors who use Persona.\nGot writer’s block? Take a trip through Lists for Writers.\nLists for Writers has a slightly different goal: dispelling writer’s block. The app consists of lots of lists dreamed up and populated by its creators: You can browse through male and female names, articles of clothing, occupations, personality traits (including phobias and philias), hobbies, “seven basic plots,” and “36 dramatic situations.” “Lists for Writers relieves some of the mental burden of generating possibilities from scratch,” its site says. If that sounds lazy, think of the app as a magician’s hat out of which you can pull random ideas to weave together into a story. Where might “Florida” + “clairvoyance” + “eggplant” + “vengeance taken upon kin for kin” take you? What about “badminton” + “Joanie” + “a talking cat”? If popular literature takes a decisive turn toward wacky experimentalism over the next few years, thank Lists for Writers (as well as Donald Barthelme).\nThen there are the apps that aim to tighten and sparkle up your prose. Hemingway will kill your darlings until each sentence is bold and clear enough to satisfy Papa—it highlights adverbs, unnecessarily flashy words (such as “utilize” for “use”), and instances of passive voice. Long, rambling sentences get shown in yellow; very intricate and complex clauses characterized by repetitiveness and awkward phrasing are bathed in a haze of red as if to put the writer’s inner pilot on alert that an imminent stop is required—though if you persist through the red to see if the furious ghost of Hemingway eventually appears to admonish you for unconscionable verbosity, you will discover that, unfortunately, it does not. I checked.\nOne worry with apps like these is that they will produce uninspired cookie-cutter novels. Should writing be easy? Composing by numbers, or by consulting a dropdown menu, seems destined to result in a clanky product, not a living thing. Then again, I am invoking the notion that creation (what God, a parent, or an artist does) is different from production (what a factory does). Maybe that binary is ripe for dissolution, as Andy Warhol demonstrated for visual art in the ’60s! Or maybe the answer is an interface that, despite its pragmatic, process-based hacks, takes a gloriously open-ended approach to content.\nEnter Scrivener. A lot of writers I reached out to love Scrivener. “It’s excellent. Can’t recommend it enough,” says Jeff Wilser, who used the app to write his forthcoming book The Good News About What’s Bad for You … and the Bad News About What’s Good for You. It’s “not one of those punitive, God-will-condemn—no, embarrass—you-if-you-don’t-write apps,” says Melinda Salata, an English teacher in Bethesda, Maryland. In 2008, Scrivener earned a rapturous review from Virginia Heffernan in the New York Times. “The happy, broad-minded, process-friendly Scrivener software encourages note-taking and outlining and restructuring and promises all the exhilaration of a productive desk: ‘a ring-binder, a scrapbook, a corkboard, an outliner and text editor all rolled into one,’ ” Heffernan wrote.\nBut Scrivener’s starry-eyed apostles notwithstanding, a crucial question remains: Are there any writing apps out there that will actually make you more creative? Not more fiercely productive. Not more efficient. But more imaginative, fresh, inspired, and afire with what Wordsworth called the “auxiliary light” of the mind? Does the app exist that will make your novel come out not simply faster and cleaner, but better?\nThen again, I wrote this article in Microsoft Word."

The official added that a small team found their quarry hiding in a large home in an affluent suburb of Islamabad. The raid occurred in the early morning hours Sunday.\nThe attacks a decade ago seemed to come out of nowhere, even though al-Qaida had previously damaged American targets overseas.\nThe terrorists hijacked planes, flew one of them into one of Manhattan's Twin Towers - and, moments later, into the other one. Both buildings collapsed, trapping thousands inside and claiming the lives of firefighters and others who had rushed to help them.\nA third plane slammed into the Pentagon, defacing the symbol of America's military night. A fourth crashed in rural Pennsylvania after passengers overpowered the hijackers and forced it down - before it could hit its intended target in Washington.\nObama struck a less than boastful tone in his brief announcement, although he said the death of bin Laden was \"the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaida.\nMoments after he spoke, American officials cautioned that the events could lead to heightened threats against the United States."

During the debut episode, Russo talked about why Roman Reigns got booed at Royal Rumble 2015 and why Seth Rollins is not over with the fans.\nAccording to Russo, Reigns got booed out of the building at Royal Rumble 2015 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania because WWE unnecessarily put Daniel Bryan in the over-the-top-rope battle royal and Reigns was left in the match with other performers who had no chance of winning and going on to headline WrestleMania 31.\n\"It had a lot to do with putting Daniel Bryan in that match, which they didn't have to put him in, having him eliminated, leaving Reigns in there with three other guys that had no chance of winning the match, so they put Reigns in a horrible position. The people booed him out of the building.\" Russo continued, \"From that day on, from where I sit, my professional opinion is that the WWE has been catering to the internet, the internet wrestling community, the small audience with the loudest voice! Everything they said they weren't going to do, now they are doing. They are catering to that crowd, which they already have. The casual fans are no longer there.\"\nRusso claimed that during Attitude Era Vince McMahon instructed the WWE writing staff to ignore the IWC and focus on attracting casual viewers.\n\"I can remember back in the day working for the WWE, we were told to ignore the internet.'Don't read what the internet is saying; that is the minority with the loudest voice; those are traditional wrestling fans that are going to watch the product no matter what'\", Russo added, \"The key to success is to go out and get those casual television viewers and make wrestling cool again. That's what the Attitude Era was all about.\"\nAlso, on the premiere episode of Nuclear Heat, Russo stated that Rollins is not over because his character has been written in such a way that makes it impossible for the audience to connect with him.\n\"Seth Rollins is a great wrestler, Seth Rollins is not over,\" Russo said. \"The reason Seth Rollins is not over is because creative has butchered his character. He [has] got more personalities than Sybil. One week, he's running away. The next week, he's standing up to Dean Ambrose. The next week, he's running away. The next week, he's standing up to Triple H. There have been so many changes with this Seth Rollins, there is no way anybody in the audience can be emotionally attached to him.\"\nRusso went on to compare Rollins to WWE Hall of Famer, Shawn Michaels.\n\"[If] you want to see the difference in what I am talking about, go back to the Attitude Era and watch [when] Shawn Michaels was the [WWE] Champion. Watch the consistency of his character. He always stayed true to himself! Seth Rollins is a Duncan Yo-Yo, it's up, it's down, up and down, up and down, up and down.\"\nClick here to check out the rest of the debut episode.

But business optimism has taken a significant hit, according to the central bank’s first quarterly business outlook survey of 2019, released Monday.\nVirtually all measures were weaker in the quarter, including sales growth, spending plans and hiring intentions, with many key readings slipping below their historical averages.\n“The main headwinds are a more uncertain outlook in the western Canadian energy sector, continued weakness in housing-related activity in some regions and tangible impacts from global trade tensions,” the bank said.\nThe survey’s composite indicator slipped to negative 0.64 in the first quarter, down from a positive reading of 2.31 in the final quarter of last year, according to the survey. The bank attributed this to lower demand in both Canada and in foreign markets.\nThe last time the survey was in negative territory was in the third quarter of 2016.\nEconomists said the survey results don’t come as a huge surprise given the marked slowdown in the economy since the end of last year. The findings strongly suggest the Bank of Canada will leave its key rate unchanged at its next rate announcement on April 24, and perhaps do nothing through the rest of the year.\nOn the other hand, the central bank has shown no indication that it is considering a rate cut, analysts said.\n“The [survey] doesn’t paint the picture of an economy falling off a cliff, but rather one dealing with a meaningful soft patch,” Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes said in a research note.\nThe more pessimistic business mood suggests the central bank’s next rate hike is “a lot further away than thought just a few months ago,” said Royal Bank of Canada economist Nathan Janzen.\nThe business survey is typically the final piece of evidence that Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and his colleagues use to make their rate decisions.\nThe bank has raised its key interest rate, now at 1.75 per cent, five times since mid-2017. The last of those hikes was in October, 2018. Mr. Poloz and other bank officials have said they expect the economic slowdown to be temporary and that growth will pick up again in the second half of the year.\nThe composite indicator combines companies’ responses to questions about investing, hiring, sales, inflation and capacity pressures.\nForty-five per cent of companies reported weaker sales growth in the past 12 months, compared with 39 per cent who experienced higher sales growth. Nonetheless, a slightly larger percentage (40 per cent) expect higher sales growth in the next year, compared with 34 per cent who expect slower sales growth.\nMeanwhile, 39 per cent of respondents said they plan to boost investment, compared with 19 per cent planning to cut spending.\nNearly half of companies plan to hire more workers, but that is down from the previous survey.\nThe share of companies reporting capacity pressures fell to 31 per cent – the lowest reading since 2015. There was also a sharp drop in the share of companies reporting problems finding workers.\nThe survey is based on interviews with executives from 100 companies, selected to roughly match the makeup of the Canadian economy. It was conducted between Feb. 19 and March 13.\nA separate survey of bank loan officers, also released Monday, showed that demand for all types of household borrowing, including mortgages, declined in the first quarter owing to higher interest rates and lower housing activity."

        "text": "Wait, what time is it?\nAt the beginning of my 1:10 p.m. journalism class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the room’s sole clock displays the time as 12:04. Whenever I check the time in that class, I have to remember to do the math to figure out the correct time. Adding 66 minutes to the time in my head isn’t hard, but it would be easier if someone could just fix the clock.\nIn my Literature Humanities class, the clock is on the wall behind me. I can’t obnoxiously turn around and check the clock whenever I feel compelled to; instead, I keep my phone in my lap and check the time there periodically.\nI’ve gotten weirdly obsessed with time. Back in my room, I’ll check Instagram at 7:02 p.m. and tell myself that at 7:15 I’ll start my work. And then it’s 7:16, so I tell myself I’ll work at 7:20. But now I’m on YouTube, and I’m watching a six-minute video. So by the time it’s done, it’s 7:22, and now I decide that I’ll work at 7:30. This goes on and on.\nI like to know how much longer I have to be in class, but not because I’m uninterested in the material. While I look at the clock in class, I’m counting down how long until I get to go back to my room and take a 10-minute nap before going out somewhere to work on one of the two essays I have due the next day.\nUsually, my 10-minute naps turn into 20-minute naps, which then turn into an hour-long naps because I didn’t set an alarm. I’ve only successfully napped for 10 minutes once. While reading the Odyssey an hour before Lit Hum, my eyes wouldn’t stay open, and I couldn’t remember the words I read as I drifted in and out of sleep. I woke up 10 minutes later with enough energy to finish the last 50 pages.\nIt seems like I never have enough time to do everything I need to do. The past few weeks have been especially hard for me to find time to do work. Lately, I’ve been going to sleep before finishing all my homework. Not on purpose, but late night naps turn into deep sleep very easily. When people in class talk about their homework and talk about how they stayed up until 3 a.m. working, I feel like I’m losing a nonexistent competition. Rather than staying up, I stumble into sleep at 10:56 p.m., and I wake up frantic with anxiety, rushing to sloppily finish my work in time before class. Then, I tell myself that today I will finish my work before I go to sleep. And that weekend I tell myself that I’ll finish my work ahead of time. I’m lying to myself, because this never happens.\nToday a friend sent a text in our group chat saying she was going to skip dinner. In the last few weeks, she’s often skipped lunch in order to go to the Writing Center or office hours or math tutoring. A few weeks ago, I had an essay due before class, and I skipped lunch in order to finish it. As a stressed college student, I see time as a resource that I have to take full advantage of. We experience time in blocks—each one allocated to work, clubs, eating, and sleeping—and when our work needs more time, the meals block or sleeping block get less time.\nMy first month of college has been full of academic failures (and successes, but it’s easier to dwell on the mistakes). I’ve forgotten to turn in an assignment, turned in an essay 20 hours late, and turned in a different essay 22 hours late. All of these failures can be traced back to my difficulties with measuring, separating, and allocating time. It’s bad, I know, but I’m really trying to be better.\nBefore coming to Columbia, I’d heard about “stress culture” and how it affects people. But I thought that it was something you could avoid by managing your time, getting enough sleep, and eating a healthy diet. Maybe it is manageable, and I just haven’t figured it out yet. I know that my perception of time as blocks undoubtedly exacerbates my tense relationship with stress.\nI don’t know how to solve the problem of stress culture at Columbia, but I think working on time management could help. Surely, staring at the clock and being hyperaware of every minute that passes isn’t beneficial. I’m still trying to understand how I can balance my life as a student without being so attentive to time. Or maybe I should get a watch."

        "text": "The \"Pandora's box\" of unmanned aircraft in the UK has been opened, according to the Astraea consortium.\nYet many technology and ethics issues surrounding civilian drones are yet to be solved, journalists at London's Science Media Centre were told.\nThe UK-led, £62m Astraea project - which has participation of the UK Civil Aviation Authority - is attempting to tackle all facets of the idea.\nLater in November, they will carry out a crucial collision-avoidance test.\nUnmanned aircraft or UAs is something of a new name for drones, which have gained notoriety principally in the theatre of war where remotely operated aircraft are used for surveillance or air strikes.\nBut the same technology put to use for civilian purposes is already a hot topic of debate in the UK and abroad, most recently surrounding their use by London's Metropolitan Police.\nA recent report by the UK's Aerospace, Aviation and Defence Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN) found that applications for unmanned aircraft are said to be worth some £260bn - replacing costly or dangerous work done by manned planes, or opening up new applications that are currently out of reach.\nCrop or wildlife stock monitoring, search and rescue, and check-ups on railway lines are some of the envisioned uses of UAs.\n\"All these things are currently done by manned aircraft, and they're done in currently quite hazardous environments,\" said Ruth Mallors, director of the Aerospace KTN.\n\"We want to use unmanned aircraft in these applications, but to be able to do that we have to demonstrate that were complying with the Civil Aviation Authority regulations, which are for manned aircraft.\n\"There's not going to be any new regulations - we'll comply with the regulations in place.\"\nThat is what brings about the technological challenge. The project involves sensors to be the \"eyes\" of a UA, the software to carry out manoeuvres and collision avoidance, and the aircraft themselves.\nPlans for UAs envision that a pilot will always be on the ground controlling them, but they must have on-board technology that can perform in an emergency - in the eyes of aviation law - as well as a pilot.\n\"These things are going to have a level of self-determinism, particularly if you ever lose the communication link with the ground control,\" said Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal, Astraea project director. \"They've got to be able to operate fully safely and take the right decisions.\n\"But we're not talking about unthinking drones, we're not talking about irrational and unpredictable behaviour, and we're not talking about something that gets itself up in the morning, goes off and does its own things and comes home without any human oversight.\"\nThe project has the participation of major contractors including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Thales UK. But they are also working closely with the Civil Aviation Authority, who will ultimately control the licensing for UAs when they pass stringent safety tests.\nGary Clayton, head of research and technology for EADS Cassidian, another project partner, said the CAA's publication CAP722 is being held up internationally as a template for aviation legislation around UAs.\nBut Mr Dopping-Hepenstal said the project is aiming much further than the technology and safety legislation.\n\"What this programme is trying to do is look at this holistically,\" he said. \"It's not just the technology, we're trying to think about the social impact of this and the ethical and legal things associated with it. You've got to solve all this lot if you're going to make it happen, enable it to happen affordably.\"\nChris Elliott, an aerospace engineer and barrister, is acting as consultant to the project. He told reporters that the licensing and privacy questions were points \"to debate, not to pontificate\".\n\"We have a very robust privacy regime now for aviation, and I don't see much very different. A lot of it comes down to what society thinks is acceptable,\" he said.\n\"I find it interesting that Google has got away with its [Streetview] because we love Google and we all use it. If this technology positioned to something that is good for us, that we like, then people will accept that kind of behaviour.\n\"Pandora's box is open - these things are going to fly. What we need is to engage everybody, the public and the specialists, with understanding the good and bad sides.\"\nFor now, though, safety is paramount. The Astraea project will carry out real-world collision-avoidance tests using three planes in two weeks' time, putting their autonomous control software through its paces and ensuring that unmanned aircraft can independently avoid a crash."

        "text": "Kim Diorio, Palo Alto High School principal from 2013 to 2018. Photo by Veronica Weber.\n• Weekly journalists discuss the resignation of Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio on this week's \"Behind the Headlines.\" Watch the webcast here.\nThe week began with Kim Diorio objecting to the public release of a letter reprimanding her for her handling of a campus sexual assault case in 2016 and has ended with her resignation as Palo Alto High School principal.\nOn Friday morning -- two days after she disclosed the letter herself, along with a detailed rebuttal -- she notified staff, students and parents that she will leave Paly at the end of the school year.\n\"After 11 wonderful years at Paly, I've decided that it's time for me to take the next step in my career,\" she wrote to staff. \"The decision wasn't an easy one, especially given the thought of no longer seeing and working with all of you on a daily basis. Frankly, it's not one I seriously considered before the start of the new year.\"\nDiorio, who announced on Feb. 23 she was going on an immediate medical leave, wrote in a separate message to parents that she plans to return \"later this spring to wrap up the school year.\"\nDiorio went on the offensive this week as her role in responding to a female Paly student who said she was sexually assaulted in a campus bathroom in 2016 was again publicly scrutinized. Since the case was publicly reported last May, many in the community have called for Diorio's removal, while Paly teachers and staff rallied in her defense, both publicly and privately.\nThe Jan. 11 letter of reprimand, from interim Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources Anne Brown, states that Diorio failed to provide the female Paly student with the \"full range of procedural options\" under federal and state law and district policy.\nThe letter cites the findings of an external law firm the district hired last year to investigate its handling of the sexual-assault report.\nThe firm, Cozen O'Connor, found that while Paly administrators initially responded promptly to the student, multiple missteps resulted in legal and policy violations \"under your leadership,\" Brown wrote to Diorio.\nDiorio's seven-page response argues that district leadership was responsible for failures in the case, particularly former Title IX coordinator Holly Wade, who Diorio said told that her and other Paly staff that no formal district investigation was necessary in the case.\n\"School staff should not be held personally or professionally responsible for implementing district office directives,\" Diorio wrote in her response.\nDiorio has been principal of Paly since 2013. She replaced Phil Winston, who resigned in 2013, citing health and \"work-life balance\" reasons. The Weekly later reported, citing documents it obtained through Public Records Act requests, that Winston had been disciplined for sexually harassing and behaving inappropriately with both staff and students.\nDiorio, who began her counseling and administrative career at schools in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, was hired by Palo Alto Unified in 2005 to work as a counselor at JLS Middle School and Gunn High School. She was promoted to Paly assistant principal in 2007.\nHer message to staff notes the school's accomplishments over the last several years, from ending a practice of student streaking and opening a wellness center to the expansion of \"innovative\" educational programs, such as Paly's Social Justice Pathway and Media Arts programs.\nDiorio told staff she is \"currently weighing a number of options\" for what she'll pursue after leaving Paly, but plans to make her \"health a priority,\" spend time with her family and finish a dissertation.\nThe district has hired a retired administrator to serve as acting principal in Diorio's absence.\nInterim Superintendent Karen Hendricks said Saturday morning that the district is working with the acting principal, Frank \"Pancho\" Rodriguez, to \"extend\" his time at Paly but that she still expects Diorio to return sometime in the spring.\nThere has been \"no change in assignment or responsibility\" for Diorio, Hendricks said.\nTo potential candidates for this position: Do not be tempted by the $$$ or cache of teaching in this district. Until the board/district office gets its proverbial house in order, THIS WILL BE YOU. Until each board member takes personal responsibility for the toxic culture (favoritism, fomenting, inequitable application of ed code) every administrator is on borrowed time. Coupled with PAOnline's clear editorial bias against PAUSD staff, it isn't possible to be a successful principal at a high school in Palo Alto at this time.\n@Pay Attention, if you are a Paly administrator, I hope you too decide to move on. Most of the administrators are good people who want to do good work. But if they don't own their shortcomings and admit mistakes, they need to move on. Board favoritism? What are you even talking about? Just follow the law, do your job, try to do better, and things will be ok.\nI am a Paly teacher and I am very saddened that Kim decided to resign. She was very supportive of teachers AND of students. She always made the best decision possible and I think it’s a grave shame that is not enough for this community.\nThe problem with making her job so unbearable and impossible to succeed in is who of quality and competence is going to want to subject themselves to such vitriol and callousness. Kim gave her heart to this school and the community stepped all over it. I dare the board and district office to find someone more caring and passionate to improve the lives of our students.\nThis is a clear case of administration failures.\nWhere is the legal team? It suppose to protect and relieve principles from missteps in litigation.\nIf the principal did not follow the instruction gave by the legal team then you can blame principals on it.\ntie up on legal ramifications.\ngetting bogged down by each individual legal cases. Hired competent legal team is the key.\nThank you Ms Diorio for all of your work at Paly. My child is graduating this year, after a great run at Paly. Please know that most of us parents are grateful, and feel awful that this paper and this district continue to skewer the very people that take such good care of our kids. I grew up in Palo Alto, and this horrifies me. Again, thank you for all you have done for our kids. I am sure, you will find great success in your future.\noneanddone is a registered user.\nTeacher is a registered user.\nThis school board has done the entire community a huge disservice by forcing out the most student-centered, thoughtful, progressive, competent, and conscientious principal we have had in the 20 years I have been here. This was the failure of a much larger system and of the school board, not of Kim Diorio.\nIt is the SCHOOL BOARD's responsibility to vet the attorneys they hire, and they hired attorneys that repeatedly failed to provide accurate information about the laws. Administrators can only follow the advice they are given.\nIt is the SCHOOL BOARD's responsibility to make sure its administrators are trained in Title IX compliance, which is something they did not do until it after it was too late.\nIt is the SCHOOL BOARD's responsibility to set policies and procedures for parents and for administrators, and their policies were unlawful.\nBut instead of taking responsibility for their own mistakes they, in true PAUSD fashion, forced out the superintendent, the principal, and perhaps others still yet to get let go, in order to keep their elected positions and to cowtow to this community's punitive mentality.\nThe fact that this SCHOOL BOARD actually believes that these students are \"safer\" or better off without Kim Diorio is absurd. Instead of evaluating their own shortcomings in creating the system that failed here, they instead left our school without leadership a week after the 2nd deadliest school shooting in US history and a week before our WASC review. Unforgivable.\nI am so saddened by Kim Diorio leaving. Our son is a freshman at Paly and it seems like every year he has gotten a new principal since 5th grade. I can understand 100% why Kim is leaving and I support her in the decision. Who wants to work endless hours and then get blamed for items where she followed the districts guidelines?\nI am also extremely disappointed in PAUSD. It is just churning out the leadership at such an amazing rate. It is a very unstable place to be sending our children and I question the district's ability to attract and retain top leadership and teachers. Perhaps the district and community will see that money cannot buy quality administration and teachers; there comes a point when quality of life surpasses the financial rewards. Hopefully realizing that compassion, kindness, collaboration, and caring are what really matter. Maybe learning about Bhutan and Gross National Happiness would be a wise next step for PAUSD and the Palo Alto Community.\nI do hope that the district and the community can begin to understand that every time a finger is pointed, 3 fingers point back. It is vital that we all reflect on why there is so much anger and bitterness. I hope that the community can work together and help each other take our responsibilities seriously. Maybe we can all explore why there is such a focus on expecting the schools to be responsible for parenting and teaching our children values and other topics that need to be taught in the home.\nAs I write this, I myself am looking at what I am doing and reflecting on what I can do better as a parent and community member. I hope and pray others will do the same.\nTeacher2 is a registered user.\nI don't see how the report can blame her for not speaking up sooner about Phil Winston -- Let's remember that he was a personal friend of Kevin Skelley, and that all of the Superintendents were male at that time. To blame her for not wanting to go up against her boss and the entire Boys Club that was in power without first collecting overwhelming evidence is absurd.\nAnd the report says that Holly Wade forged a document to conceal that she was consulting with an attorney she had specifically been told not to use? But then following the advice of that attorney is somehow Kim's fault?\nCalsildia is a registered user.\nI'd like to offer perspective from victims of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and bullying within PAUSD.\nNot only did each of them had to endure every second of the incidents, they also suffer from PTSD, subsequent humiliation and retaliation, after they gathered the courage to report. Their families supported them, but school and district did not, even after repeated pleads. Many of them could no longer bear stepping on the grounds of what's called their school. They left PAUSD in silence, carrying the physical and emotional scars with them.\nLet's not forget the victims!\nLet's ask ourselves what it takes to end sexual assault, sexual harassment, and bullying.\nLet's develop the courage to take care of the victims, even if it means to go against the norm.\nCivil War did not come at a cheap price - but it was necessary.\n#metoo will not be easy, but it is worth it!\nHelen Does is a registered user.\nThe district is getting its house in order. [Portion removed.] Now the school board needs to reflect on their failings. No more finger pointing. Get your own act together.\nResponsibility is a registered user.\n@Teacher - While I Agree with you in general, I am not sure we can blame the attorney for bad advice. We don't know what information was presented to her. What we have heard is that Dioro reported information to Holly Wade, then Holly Wade either rejected a UCC or reported it to the attorney, Dora Dome. We can't know for certain exactly what or how that information was reported to her. At the same time, it all seems to show and incredible lack of common sense, and acts of carelessness lacking compassion for the injured students.\nThe School Board is a policy making body. It is responsible for overall policy. It is the Superintendent and the people who work for him or her who are responsible for caring out policy. PAUSD's Superintendent didn't do this. He promoted a subordinate and continued using attorney(s) who did not train or comply with Title IX. Unfortunately, the Board at the time attached every and anyone who tried to show them not to, including children, the disabled, and other Board Members. But most of the members except Baten Caswell who caused the hurt are gone.\nThe Superintendent's subordinate, Holly Wade, told him and the Board she did a lot, and achieved a lot with 100% compliance. Where the Board failed was buying this incredible story that was too good to be true, year after year, even in the face of OCR findings, Special Education reports of failure, protesting parents, and budget crises. [Portion removed.] Then they approved a reorganization with massive hiring expenditures putting no controls over Wade's power. Just bad leadership.\n@ Teacher - so the more I think about it, the more I agree with you.\nHolly Wade didn't actually resign as keeps being reported. She was told her position was being eliminated. Yes, she is gone, but if she altered documents, why wasn't this reported to an Administrative Teaching Credential Board? Parents could have told you of suspect practices for years. Was Phil Winston reported? Was child protective services notified? When so many girls were attacked, was the County or CPS told? Are there mandatory reporting requirements for these things? Are parents or teachers given any rights or procedures to report to the County or State when children are endangered?"

        "text": "Special United States envoy Sol Linowitz is setting the pace and style of the three-sided marathon talks on Palestinian autonomy under way in this tranquil seaside resort. But Israel appears to be determining the parameters of the negotiations. Mr. Linowitz's preferences for bilateral discussions and for minimal public disclosure are being respected by his counterparts, Israeli Interior Minister Yosef Burg and Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil. The negotiating schedule calls for an almost daily routine through May 8, after which the talks resume in Egypt until the May 26 target date for an autonomy agreement. But the so-called four points of Israel's Prime Minister Menacham Begin pose the main challenge to the marathon's participants. According to his media adviser, Dan Pattir, these points assure the establishment of \"functional\" Palestinian administration rather than laying the foundation for a Palestinian state: 1. Jewish settlement projects would continue during the initial five-year running-in period. Existing settlements would be subject to Israeli law only. 2. Jerusalem's Arab quarters would not be included in the autonomy nor would their residents be allowed to vote in the elections for the self-governing authority's administrative council or other institutions. 3. The autonomous administration would not be granted legislative or judicial powers. 4. All matters affecting military security would be the sole prerogative of Israel. However, a senior Israeli political source cited three areas in which Israel's position might be softened: a settlement freeze (unannounced, but effective) at least for the marathon's duration; allowing the autonomy institutions a say on security or military matters; and granting Arab Jerusalemites the right to vote in the autonomy without incorporating any part of the city within its geographical limits."

Called Generation Next, the survey examined the career aspirations of the younger generation in finance today.\nPolling over 18,000 professionals under the age of 36, the survey found that a large majority of today’s young finance professionals intend to start their own company.\n‘The next generation are aspirational, entrepreneurial and unafraid of going solo,’ said Helen Brand OBE, chief executive of ACCA.\nThe report also reveals that almost three quarters (70%) of respondents are looking to move jobs in the next two years, with 67% looking for a promotion.\nRespondents indicated that they were more likely to stay with an employer if they offered the opportunity to learn and develop skills (88%), career progression opportunities (88%) and a competitive financial remuneration package (87%).\n“Our future finance leaders are happy to seize the initiative in the labour market to achieve professional satisfaction. They know that demand for their skills is high and if their employer isn’t delivering, they won’t wait around. The result of that is employers can’t attract, nurture or retain the finance leaders of tomorrow in the same way they did the leaders of today,” added Helen Brand.\nWhile generation next employees of both genders sought rapid career progression, female respondents were more likely to show loyalty to their current employer than their male counterparts.\n“The research shows that women are more likely to be happy with their current remuneration (36%, compared to 30% of men) and to expect to stay with their current employer in their next role (42%, compared to 37% of men),” added Helen Brand.\nMuch has been written over the past few years on the threat of automation to jobs, but for the next generation of accountants, the rise of the robots presents an opportunity, not a risk.\n“The next generation understands that automation will replace the need for human capital across a number of functions, but far from being threatened by this, they see it as an opportunity to free up time for strategic activities."

He loved the way the buildings muscled their way into that sky. And he loved walking through the buildings, seeing the way the light from the windows shed a casual radiance on ordinary objects such as doors and walls.\n\"I can walk into a housing project and be transported by the quality of the light,\" Fortino said. \"That's what got me through seeing the other things -- the things you associate with public housing: the way the light falls on the buildings.\"\nWhen it came time for him to undertake a project for his graduate thesis in photography at the University of Illinois at Chicago, then, Fortino knew his destination: Cabrini, where he had walked a beat since 1988.\nStarting last summer, Fortino began to take pictures of the front doors of Cabrini apartments.\n\"Doors have a psychological weight to them,\" he said in the quiet, understated way he talks about his work. \"It just seemed to make sense to me.\"\nInitially, he photographed doors here and there, when he found himself intrigued by a particular color or a smattering of graffiti. That approach troubled him, however; he wanted the project to be more systematic, to record the range of Cabrini thresholds, not simply his own tastes and whims.\nSo he selected a single building -- 911 N. Hudson St. -- and took pictures of all 48 doors in the six-story structure. \"I chose it because it was manageable,\" Fortino said. \"Some of the buildings are 19 stories, with 20 apartments per floor. That was too much.\"\nHe and a friend, Tom Nowak, who helped with the lighting, were careful to treat the doors identically, \"to maintain a consistent viewpoint,\" Fortino said. He set up his camera and tripod the same distance from each entryway.\nHe asked residents for permission to take the pictures; none seemed to care one way or another. \"We initiated conversations with women going in and out of the apartments. Instead of being curious about us, mostly they wanted to know why things weren't getting fixed like they ought to be.\"\nFortino knows that his access to Cabrini -- an area riddled with crime and gang violence -- is enabled by his profession.\n\"When I'm there, it is known that I am the police. We use that knowledge as protection,\" he said. \"I have a radio with me. I am armed. Tom wears a bulletproof vest.\" Without those preparations, \"We would be prey, rather than on an equal footing.\"\nWhen Fortino recently displayed the photographs for a committee of UIC professors, a requirement for graduate students in the School of Art & Design, the reaction was intense. Many appreciated Fortino's careful archiving of objects not often viewed by anyone but the very poor; others felt Fortino had somehow insulted Cabrini residents, invading their privacy by presenting their front doors in such a stark, blunt manner.\nOne thing was clear, however: Fortino's work left no one unmoved. And if provoking a reaction is one of the purposes of art, if the point is to shake people out of their numbed neutrality, then the photographs are undeniably, if disturbingly, successful.\nAlso, rather unexpectedly, the photographs are suffused with beauty.\n\"Beauty\" is not a word Fortino or many other serious photographers would employ. It is an unfashionable word because, as Fortino explained, \"It's hierarchical. If something is beautiful, that means something else is ugly, and that's a value judgment.\"\nAn amateur onlooker, however, can say it out loud without fear of rebuke: The doors, in their color and variety, are beautiful in a scruffy, utilitarian way. They are as complicated as faces; like faces, they both hide and reveal, keep in and keep out. To some, a closed door may be an unfinished sentence or a held breath. In the next moment, anything can happen.\nThe collection of Cabrini doors, moreover, subtly recalls the well-known poster series celebrating doors in places such as Dublin, doors with fancy carving and stained glass. A door is a door is a door -- except that it isn't.\nNowak, who teaches photography part time at Columbia College, said he initially wondered about the point of Fortino's project. \"I thought, `Doors?' and I said, `Scott, can't you find something else?' But as we walked through the building, I saw that the doors had character. They weren't all the same, by any means. Each door was different.\"\nEsther Parada, a UIC photography professor for whose class Fortino undertook his \"doorway project,\" as he calls it, said the discomfort aroused by the photographs may originate in concerns among documentary photographers about the objectification of poverty and other conditions.\n\"Since the late 1970s, there has been a lot more attention to the power dynamics in photography: Who's looking at whom and through what lens? It's all about the manipulation of framing and point of view.\"\nIn earlier times, people looked at photographs as simple truth. As Susan Sontag phrased it in \"On Photography,\" her 1977 book, \"Photographs furnish evidence. A photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened.\" Words could be slanted, but pictures didn't lie: \"What is written about a person or event is frankly an interpretation, as are handmade visual statements, like paintings and drawings. Photographed images do not seem to be statements of the world as much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality.\"\nNow, however, virtually everyone concedes that photographs are no more truthful than anything else, that they represent a prejudiced point of view just as do words. The concern, therefore, is that by choosing certain objects or people of which to make pictures, the photographer exerts power over the subjects.\nIn other words, while we have Fortino's view of the Cabrini doors, we do not -- because of a variety of factors -- have the Cabrini residents' view of Fortino's door or their own doors. Whether we think of it consciously or not, photographs are transactions, representing power relationships. Race adds another complication: Fortino is white, Cabrini predominantly black; he is an outsider looking at a world not his own.\nCabrini spokeswoman Carol Steele, while unfamiliar with Fortino's project, said she is glad someone saw beyond what she regards as the buildings' ill-kept exteriors -- but she wishes he had gone past the individual front doors as well.\n\"The media is always taking pictures of the outsides of the buildings,\" said Steele, president of the Cabrini Rowhouse Management Council. \"They don't go inside. People don't realize that (Cabrini residents) take care of their places too. They live just like everybody else.\"\nFortino, for his part, is unfazed by questions and reservations. In many ways, the project represents the point at which his two worlds -- law enforcement and graduate school -- intersect, and so he anticipated a few ragged edges and mismatched surfaces.\n\"For a long time, I felt the two worlds would never meet,\" he recalled. \"Among my friends in the police department, I was considered very liberal, because I was going to art school. Among my friends in the art world, I was very conservative, because I was the police.\n\"Now, one seems to inform the other. My police life has become a large part of my art life.\"\nBorn and raised on Chicago's Southwest Side, Fortino remembers hearing his father and uncle talk about the public housing structures that were pounded in like spikes against the city's skyline. \"They were talked about in hushed tones, as dangerous places. You hear those things when you're a kid and there's a sense of wonder, of curiosity.\"\nJust before graduation from Columbia College, Fortino joined the police department. He enrolled in graduate photography courses at UIC, but police work gradually absorbed him and he dropped out in 1981.\n\"I was wrapped up in the lifestyle of being the police,\" he said. \"The thesis just couldn't get done.\"\nReturning to UIC last year, he found that the two worlds seemed less antithetical. \"Things happen for a reason,\" said Fortino, who will remain with the police force but hopes to display his photographs in a gallery. \"This is right for me now.\"\nFortino is no longer assigned to Cabrini. When he goes there to take photographs, though, the residents remember him. And he remembers them, as he admires the complicated light surrounding their homes.\n\"The light -- especially at this time of year -- is very, very nice. I could look at it all day.\"\nAs Fortino knows, he may not be looking much longer at the light falling on Cabrini. As part of its $1 billion project to demolish some 19,000 public housing units and resettle the city's poor in the next decade, the Chicago Housing Authority has torn down two of Cabrini's 24 buildings; six more are scheduled to fall. While the building in which Fortino has been working is not on the list at present, according to a CHA spokesperson the demolition project will alter the Cabrini landscape irrevocably.\n\"I wanted to make a record, a way to preserve this,\" Fortino said. \"It comes down to an appreciation for what's around you.\"\nAdditional material published Jan. 12, 1999:Corrections and clarifications.A Cabrini-Green building depicted in a photograph in Thursday's Tempo section was incorrectly identified as the six-story structure featured in a Chicago police officer's photography project. The Tribune regrets the errors."

        "text": "Heckling at hockey games can sometimes verge on offensive, but it’s a crucial part of the atmosphere, writes Morgan Reppert.\nAnyone who has ever had the pleasure of attending a hockey game—whether it be professional or junior—has learned the unspoken rules of fan etiquette. First and foremost, you should come in your team’s apparel or not at all. Secondly, always throw your hat on the ice when someone scores a hat trick. Lastly, you should keep your heckling creative; no one wants to hear “URI was my safety school” four times.\nAlthough the Mullins Center is a slightly different experience than TD Garden, it’s a close second. The beauty of attending games at the University of Massachusetts is that no one is invested in the fact that you may or may not be a Bruins fan, people are more preoccupied with the Minutemen placing the biscuit in the back of the opponent’s net. UMass hockey fans also share one massive thing in common: As Gordie Howe once said, “All hockey players are bilingual. They know English and profanity.” Howe clearly had the infamous student groups devoted to creating a lively student section—the Sons of Liberty and the Militia—in mind.\nIt’s hard to tell which erupts the crowd more, freshman goaltender Matt Murray handing Northeastern its first shutout of the season or the notorious red-haired man feasting on a Big Y sub sandwich. The two student-section groups have brought both solidarity and comradery against our opponents in the Hockey East, leading the students in provocative chants, distributing fatheads of Coach Carvel and hosting special giveaways to incite a larger student presence at games.\nThe Sons of Liberty has turned Section Q into a comedic hub. Although they have no official affiliation with UMass or UMass hockey, their witty banter has truly added to the atmosphere of the student section; their commitment to “uniting the masses” is admirable. If you haven’t been lucky enough to witness the Sons dousing themselves in blue Powerade or performing the “Cotton-Eye Joe,” you’re missing out. There is just something inspiring about the way they chant phrases like “BU doesn’t even have a campus” at the top of their lungs and then slowly sit down and smile.\nBut where do these student groups draw the line when heckling goes too far? Before the upsetting loss to Boston University, I was able to learn how the Sons of Liberty felt about bigots in the stands. Sons Cam Cavagnaro and Jeff Polidor both shed light on how, when it comes to leading the crowd, they draw a line at violating serious boundaries—as any true hockey fan would. In the short time I spent with them, it was apparent that they sincerely enjoy engaging the student section with their hysterical shenanigans.\nOn a more serious note, any true hockey fan knows that there are always people in the crowd who cross obvious boundaries when heckling. It’s all a matter of keeping the crowd engaged and electrified without shouting racial slurs and politically incorrect terms. So yes, it can be stated that heckling does have boundaries. Given the nature of the game, it is more than acceptable to stir the pot, but there is never room for bigotry and racism.\nThis article is not only accurate but also the most well written and concise article on a very difficult subject matter in the entire publication... Please note that my statement has nothing to do with my sur-name."

        "text": "Note: Use a pair of kitchen shears to snip the chives. This vinaigrette can be made a few hours ahead of time; the additional time will allow the flavors to blend, the shallots to mellow, and the color to deepen slightly.\nStep 1In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, shallots, chives, salt and pepper. When the salt has dissolved, whisk in the olive oil.\n84 calories; 0 protein; 1 gram carbohydrates; 0 fiber; 9 grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 0 cholesterol; 38 mg. sodium.\nA tall bottle of olive oil, a cruet of vinegar, a dish of sea salt, a pepper grinder. This casual kitchen still life is the simple formula for a vinaigrette, a sauce so humble that it often doesn't seem like a sauce at all.\nBut it is: In French it's called la sauce vinaigrette. And a good one transforms a bowl of salad into something extraordinary. And it's not just for salads. A drizzle of vinaigrette on the plate can elevate any number of dishes -- grilled fish or roasted chicken, pan-seared steak or wilted greens.\nAs the weather heats up and we want simpler fare, grilled outside or fresh from the market stands, a vinaigrette can be all we need -- or want.\nIt's the simplest thing in the world to make. Just memorize this: 3 to 1. That's the classic proportion of oil to vinegar.\nBecause there are so few ingredients, their quality is important. Use the best oil and vinegar you can find, good sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper.\nThe only equipment you need is a whisk and a bowl. Whisk the salt and pepper into the vinegar first -- salt doesn't dissolve in oil, but it does in vinegar. Then whisk in the oil. That's a basic sauce vinaigrette.\nA classic vinaigrette is made with red wine vinegar and olive oil. Of course you can add to it: mustard or shallots or herbs or spices. And you can vary the kind of oil and vinegar -- using walnut or hazelnut oil, balsamic or white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar.\nBut you don't have to emulsify: Everything will combine when you toss the salad. Or if you're using the vinaigrette to sauce a plate that will receive a pristine sauteed fillet of Petrale sole, you might welcome the effect of the amber beads of olive oil eddying in the rosy vinegar, the oil and vinegar beading and traveling on the plate like a pointillist painting.\nDepending on the oil and vinegar you choose and your palate, you might want to depart from the basic 3-1 ratio. The vinegar, which is the acid component of the sauce, can vary in acidity from 4% to 8% or more.\nIf you use a high-acidity vinegar, you might want to move closer to 4 parts oil to 1 part vinegar. Ditto if you substitute lemon juice for some or all of the vinegar, or if you want to really highlight a great olive oil.\nA softer vinaigrette, made with a higher percentage of a particularly floral extra virgin olive oil, perfectly complements a delicate salad of butter lettuce and fresh herbs.\nA sharper vinaigrette, with a higher proportion of, say, aged balsamic vinegar, would better accompany grilled steak or a salad of wilted bitter greens: dishes that can stand up to, or even call for, a more pronounced flavor. A mustardy vinaigrette is great with seared flank steak or a piece of wild salmon.\nExperiment with flavors by matching a mild rice wine vinegar with a touch of toasted sesame oil added to the olive oil, or pair a walnut oil with a mellow sherry vinegar.\nYou can also play with texture. Some chopped basil, a fine dice of shallots or a mash of roasted garlic adds not just flavor, but body. Whisk in grated ginger or stone-ground mustard and wild honey.\nPlaying with temperature is an option too. Heat the vinegar or use pan juices in place of some of the oil to make a hot vinaigrette -- a simple and fast sauce to complement the roast chicken or pan-seared hanger steak you've just finished.\nOr keep it simple. Composed of a kitchen's bare essentials, a vinaigrette is often best at its most elemental -- a powerful example of how good minimalism can taste."

Epic officials decline to estimate how much the building’s overhaul will cost, but say work to the roughly 40-year-old structure will be significant.\nOnce completed in early summer, the company will relocate to the new digs from its existing offices near S.

Nearly 80 employees will be based there.\nThe sale comes less than a week after Epic announced plans to invest up to $40 million in the company, through growth and expansion.\nEpic Piping is one of the original portfolio companies created in 2014 by private equity firm Bernhard Capital Partners. In the years since, the company has grown to become one of the largest heavy pipe fabricators in North America with three major fabrication facilities that, together, produce more than 20,000 pipe spools per month: a 268,000-square-foot facility in Livingston Parish, 300,000 square foot facility in San Marcos, Texas, and 400,000 square-foot facility in United Arab Emirates."

        "text": "For the last two years I’ve been reviewing connected devices as part of my role as Gigaom’s internet of things reporter. I’ve spent hours fiddling with radio networks, sliced my fingers open attaching wireless hubs to my garage door opener, giggled with my daughter while weighing out sugar on a connected scale, and generally had a good time. I’ve even had a few adventures in home wiring and and the occasional shock.\nBut of the dozens of products I’ve tested, only a few have actually been ready for the market when they’ve reached my hands. In a few cases this is to be expected: some were Kickstarter-backed projects that were shipping to the developers and reviewers at the same time and some were hitting my doorstep a month in advance of their availability in stores.\nBut others were shipping to the general backers or worse, in stores as I was testing my own versions of the products. And they just weren’t ready.\nAfter two years of this, I think it’s time the market and its participants stop shipping products that aren’t up to snuff. Because as more people start picking up these devices and trying to see what the smart home is all about, a bad experience with an underperforming or buggy product is going to turn them off from the whole concept.\nTake for example, the Wink home hub from Quirky. This product launched in July with major backing from Wink and Home Depot. My guess is the companies involved felt the pressure to get into the market quickly since there were already several players ranging from small (SmartThings, Revolv) to big (Staples Connect and Lowes Iris) that had been selling for months and even years in the case of Lowes.\nBut when Wink launched, it was buggy, lacking support for basic devices that it shared radios and aisle space with, and consumers who picked it up were pretty frustrated. Luckily, it was cheap, and Wink had the cash to keep it in the market and manage its retailers’ frustration with returns — a luxury smaller startups don’t generally have. But still, any customer who decided to take a chance on Wink to see what the fuss was about wasn’t likely to walk about thrilled with the smart home experience.\nWink wasn’t ready for market. But what about LIFX, the $99 connected light bulbs that change color and connect via Wi-Fi? The bulbs were pricey, but since Philips Hue had primed the market, others were coming in with newer variations, and LIFX was winning accolades. But in July, after a few of my friends had picked up the bulbs, an English hacking firm reported that the bulbs exposed users to a significant security flaw by letting people hack into to users’ Wi-Fi networks. Not only that, LIFX stored users Wi-Fi passwords all in one database. Both problems were quickly solved, but the exploit and the database setup exposed some basic flaws in how LIFX had handled security and notifications. Simply put, it wasn’t ready.\nMy final beef with products that aren’t ready concerns those companies that are pitching some type of algorithm as part of their value, but the algorithm isn’t quite trained on enough data yet. Much like the vaporware of the 1990s, I think of these products as faithware, as in we just have to have faith that they’ll work well and do what we want them to do. Algorithms aren’t magic. They have to be trained and even the act of training them introduces biases that mean it may not work in the way we want it to.\nIf something has a learning algorithm that assumes you love things one way (sleeping at night, for example) and you don’t live that way, it’s not going to make your life easier. So products like Canary home security system (which is on sale now and will ship in March) that offer an algorithm that will arrive eventually worry me. If learning is a big reason you are buying a product then make sure that’s a feature that exists straight out of the box when you buy it rather than down the road. Because ideally you’ll want to train it within your return window for that item.\nThis may sound harsh. I know that all of these companies are after a first mover advantage and everybody is out there right now popping a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module on an everyday object and building an app for it. But hardware is not software. There’s only so much iteration a consumer is willing to take when it comes to a functional object that she plans to install in her home. Especially an object that will be used by everyone in that home.\nNest and Philips Hue both were consumer ready products.\nIt’s fine when your app crashes; at worst, you reboot and move on. But when you spend $250 on a connected door lock that your husband was a bit dubious about in the first place, and he comes home with his arms full of groceries and gets stuck on the doorstep because the lock didn’t open, you can’t tell him to reboot. That lock is going to get returned. And my bet is your mission to connect your home just got set back by a few years.\nAs I’ve been playing with devices I’ve expected the quality to get better over time. And while I think there has been a slight uptick in overall quality — devices coming out of the PCH incubator for example tend to arrive consumer-ready (although without as great support for Android devices) I’m still surprised at the overall uneven quality of the products that are shipping to consumers. Maybe some of the entrepreneurs who participated in how we built it campaign at our Structure Connect event last year can offer a lesson or two.\nPlease, guys. I love hardware and I love connected devices. But the mainstream consumer isn’t going to love anything that they have to spend hours troubleshooting. Or that they have to worry about from a security standpoint. We may love playing with our connected outlets and sensors, but trust me, everyone else wants to just set them and forget them.\nYou have to release products that let them do that. Until you can, keep them to yourselves.\nYou tell ’em, sistah! Your voice is louder than individual consumers and IoT vendors need to hear this.\nMr. Fred Brooks said “it takes 1 effort to make a software for your own department and 3 times the effort to make the same software to be delivered to the customer”.\nIn Silicon Valley you have a bunch of people who build cloud based services. Those developers have no clue how to build software that actually runs on the customer premises.\nMaybe “the press”:) should focus on the more mature product lines more often? The sensationalism of covering only startups causes the industry to look bad when the “old” workhorse folks in the industry that have been in the market, making the user experience better and easier for years quietly go unreported. I’ll put Nexia out there as one of those, but only because I work there.\nFair enough. And as mature companies modernize by opening up APIs and embracing non-proprietary wireless protocols or even apps on our phones instead of dedicated remotes I spend more time looking at them. But yes, the media should share the blame. Mea culpa.\nStacey, part of the reason I don’t have any connected home gadgets myself is from watching what you go through. I’m capable of figuring these things out too, that’s just not how I want to spend my time. I sure hope people will listen to you."

        "text": "Homeowners are increasingly looking to technology for home security solutions, to save on heating and cooling costs and even to help them cook the perfect steak.\nIn fact, 46% of consumers recently surveyed by ERA Real Estate and HGTV said it was important for their current or next home to have smart home technology. And 51% of the 2,437 consumers polled said they’d consider installing smart home technology in their home to make it more appealing to future buyers.\nSmart home technology often refers to a home that is connected using the Internet. “Whether we are inside the house or 1,000 miles away from the house, we can control and monitor it,” said Dave Pedigo, senior director of learning and emerging technologies for the Custom Electronic Design & Installation Association.\nA big reason smart home technology is becoming more mainstream: “They’re making things so user friendly, so it’s easy for people to adopt the technology,” said Jon Ellen Snyder, a Montana real-estate broker with ERA Landmark in the Bozeman/Livingston area. It is also becoming more affordable, which helps in bringing it to the masses, she said.\nHere are some of the top smart home technology products.\nThe Nest Learning Thermostat makes it easier to control your home heating and cooling.\nProgrammable thermostats have been around for a while. It’s just that people don’t often take the time to use them properly to save on heating and cooling costs. But new-generation thermostats are much easier to program. The Nest Learning Thermostat GOOG, +0.55%, for example, records your temperature preferences over a period of time and then programs itself to mimic your use. It also can be controlled through a cellphone. A similar product on the market is the Honeywell HON, +0.96% Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat.\nHomeowners often start investing in home technology by updating their thermostats, Snyder said. That’s for a good reason, too: A programmed thermostat can cut heating and cooling costs by 20%, according to Nest’s website.\nHalf of millennials have energy management technology in their homes; one-third of Generation X and baby boomers are using this technology, the ERA/HGTV report found.\nThe Birdi smoke detector tells you more than if there’s a fire in the house.\nNest also has a smart smoke/carbon monoxide detector on the market; competitor Birdi is expected to hit the market soon.\nFar from the traditional shrieking beep, smart smoke detectors can identify and clearly tell you what the problem is and whether you’re in immediate danger. In addition, the Nest smoke/carbon monoxide detector can communicate with the Nest thermostat to shut down the gas furnace if carbon monoxide is high. If you’re not home, you can get a message on your cellphone that there is a problem. In addition to smoke and carbon monoxide alerts, Birdi also tracks air quality of a home, watching for factors including humidity and dust.\nOther, more robust and individualized systems can do more. You’d likely need a programmer to set it up, but a smoke detector that detects a fire could turn on lighting to guide people out of the house and flash outdoor lights on and off so the house is more obvious to the fire department, Pedigo said.\nDropcam can be used to monitor your home when you’re away.\nThe easy-to-set-up Dropcam has a two-way talk feature that allows you to speak with people directly when you’re watching (perhaps a way to communicate with older kids or pets when you’re out of the house); you can also be alerted when motion is detected in certain areas of the home. It also offers a recording service that allows you to go back and grab footage.\nSnyder said that in her market, where there are a lot of second homeowners, webcams are becoming a security solution for people to keep an eye on their property from afar.\nA word of caution: As with any technology, keeping systems secure is important, Pedigo said. “It’s really easy for hackers to get in and see what is on the cameras,” he said. “I don’t think that general consumers think about their safety enough.” With the help of a professional, there are things that can be done to protect the system from hackers — and your home from a virtual intrusion, he said.\niGrill will alert your smartphone when your steak is done.\nTelevisions are getting sharper (think the 4K ultra HD TV) and sound systems are becoming more elaborate (think the Dolby Atmos), and controlling them from a cellphone or tablet is often easy to set up. But other non-entertainment related home appliances are getting smarter too. Expect to see more Internet-connected appliances on the market, Pedigo said.\nAlready, LG’s 066570, +0.95% Smart ThinQ Washer and Dryer allow people to monitor laundry cycles on their cellphones. Smaller appliances also make life easier: The iGrill is a digital thermometer that can tell you when your chicken is cooked to the desired temperature — by sending an alert to your cellphone.\nAn Apple Watch may soon communicate with your home’s systems so that you’re never chilly again.\nSeven in 10 millennials said it is important that smart home technology integrates with their smartphone, according to the ERA/HGTV survey. That sentiment soon may extend to smart watches, especially with the buzz surrounding Apple Watch AAPL, +0.38% and similar products, Pedigo said.\nSoon, the watch on your wrist could tell your home’s systems to make subtle changes to a room when you’re in it, he said. Example: “Let’s say my wife likes it warmer, I like it cooler. If she is in the room the thermostat sets it at 73 degrees, and for me it’s 68 degrees,” he said.\nSeven in 10 millennials said it is important that smart home technology integrates with their smartphone, according to the ERA/HGTV survey. That sentiment soon may extend to smart watches, especially with the buzz surrounding Apple Watch US:AAPL and similar products, Pedigo said."

        "text": "Long before ufologists had descended on Rendlesham, mystery had filled the skies of Suffolk and left locals pondering their place in the universe.\nIn 1646, on the afternoon of May 21, “several apparitions” were “seene and hearde in the ayre” above Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. A pamphlet written at the time (when Brandon was still part of Norfolk) describes the strange spectacle which greeted those who saw it. “Also at Brandon, in the County of Norfolke, the inhabitants were forced to come out of their houses to behold so strange a spectacle of a spire steeple ascending to earth, an a pike or lance descending downwards from heaven,” it says.“In Brandon, in the county aforesaid, was seen at the same time a naïve or fleet of ships in the ayre, swiftly passing under sayle, with flags and streamers hanged out, as if they were ready to give an encounter.\nIn the summer edition of The Lantern in 1975, the journal notes that earlier in the year, a hunt has been made for a meteorite which might have fallen in Breckland three centuries ago. The search, by the Norwich Astronomical Society, was based on the information above, from the 1646 pamphlet. Cyril Blount, the secretary of the NAS, was convinced the pamphlet described a meteorite shower, a suspicion shared by Dr David Dewhurst of the Cambridge University observatory and Dr Keith Hindley of the Meteorite Section of the British Astronomical Society.\nOne possible point of impact suggested was the ‘Devil’s Punchbowl’, a large almost perfectly circular water-filled depression in the forest about four miles north of Thetford. Neat as the meteorite theory was, it did not explain some of the more fantastical elements of the 1646 account, which included fleets of ships, men fighting with swords in their hands and a beating of drums in the air.\nThe author continued to recount tales of fireballs destroying fields of grain and leaving behind the smell of sulphur in Cambridgeshire and the vessels spotted over Brandon.“In all these places there was very great thunder, with raine and haile-stones of extraordinary bignesse and round, and some hollow within like rings,” the account continued.\nLater theories have included that eyewitnesses may have seen weather phenomena such as a sun pillar or a sun dog.\nBoth phenomena are optical illusions which are caused by the reflection of tiny ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere which create the impression of multiple suns or vertical bands of light.\nOr, of course, the East really was visited by 17th century space pirates throwing sulphurous fireballs and hail of extraordinary bigness at Earth. The truth is out there."

        "text": "Obama administration officials announced on Friday they are proposing a fix to a Catch-22 in immigration law that could spare hundreds of thousands of American citizens from prolonged separations from illegal immigrant spouses and children.\nAlthough the regulatory tweak appears small, lawyers said it would mean that many Americans will no longer be separated for months or years from family members pursuing legal residency. Even more citizens could be encouraged to come forward to bring illegal immigrant relatives into the system, they said.\nThe fix is one of a number of recent measures by the administration that do not require the approval of Congress, designed to ease the effects on immigrant communities of contradictory or outmoded statutes. White House officials have been seeking ways to shore up sagging support for the president, particularly among Latinos.\nIn essence, officials at Citizenship and Immigration Services are proposing to change the procedures by which illegal immigrants with American family members apply for legal residency — getting a document known as a green card — allowing a crucial early step to take place in the United States rather than in the immigrant’s home country.\nAlejandro Mayorkas, the director of the agency, said the purpose was to relieve burdens on citizens while also streamlining a convoluted, costly process.\n“We are achieving a system efficiency, saving resources for the taxpayers and reducing the time of separation between a spouse or child and the U.S. citizen relative,” Mr. Mayorkas said.\nOn Friday the agency published a formal notice in The Federal Register that it was preparing a new regulation. But Mr. Mayorkas stressed that step was only the beginning of a long process the agency hopes to complete by issuing a new rule before the end of this year.\nThe applause from lawyers, Latinos and immigrant organizations was a strikingly different message than the administration has heard for many months.\n“This will open up a huge door to bring a large number of people into the light,” said Charles Kuck, an immigration lawyer in Atlanta who is a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Based on their caseloads and census data, lawyers estimate that many hundreds of thousands of Americans are married to illegal immigrants.\nThe new rule would make no change in the situation of illegal immigrants who do not have immediate American family members. White House officials acknowledge that there will be no progress before the November elections on legislation the president supports to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants.\nUnder the law, American citizens are entitled to apply for green cards for immigrant spouses and children, even those who entered the country illegally. But the law requires most to return to their home countries to receive their visas.\nThe catch is that once the immigrants leave the United States, they are automatically barred from returning for at least three years and often for a decade, even if they are fully eligible to become legal residents.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services can provide a waiver from those bars, if the immigrants can show that their absence would cause “extreme hardship” to a United States citizen. But for the past decade, obtaining the waiver was almost as difficult and time-consuming as getting the green card.\nImmigrants had to return to their countries to wait while the waiver was approved. Waiting times extended to months, even years. Sometimes waivers were not approved, and immigrants were permanently separated from their American families.\nThe journey toward green cards for which they were eligible was so risky that many families simply decided to live in hiding and not apply.\nNow Citizenship and Immigration Services proposes to allow illegal immigrants to get a provisional waiver in the United States before they leave to pick up their visas. Having the waiver in hand will allow them to depart knowing they almost certainly will be allowed to return, officials said. The agency is also seeking to cut down wait times for immigrants overseas to only a few weeks.\n“Finally — an opportunity,” said one American citizen in North Carolina who has been married for seven years to an illegal immigrant from Honduras. The woman said she wept Friday when she heard the news of the waiver proposal.\nThe couple owns a construction business and has four children who are citizens. They tried to apply for his legal documents, she said, but immigration lawyers advised them that if he left for Honduras to pick up a visa, he would be unable to return for 10 years. “If you try to come out of the shadows, your family will suffer,” the lawyers told her.\nNow they will start his application again, said the woman, who remained reluctant to publish her name until the new rule takes effect.\nRepublicans criticized the move as an effort by Mr. Obama to circumvent Congress. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called it “an abuse of administrative powers.” Mr. Smith was an author of legislation in 1996 that created the 3- and 10-year bars to return by illegal immigrants.\nNancy Kuznetsov, a leader of American Families United, a group of Americans who are struggling in the immigration system, said many members called her Friday, elated."

        "text": "Walter Graf, a Los Angeles cardiologist who pioneered the training of paramedics, has died. He was 98.\nAs recently as the 1960s, a patient being rushed to the hospital with crushing chest pain would be treated en route only with sirens and sympathy.\nAlarmed by high death rates and encouraged by new technology, a small group of pioneering physicians started equipping ambulances with defibrillators and paramedics who knew how to use them. Although today the idea seems straightforward, it was a radical departure from established protocols and was credited with saving countless lives.\n\"What it all means is that if you have any regard for your health and are over 40, you ought to move to Los Angeles,\" Dr. Walter S. Graf told The Times in 1978. \"Your chances for avoiding sudden death are enhanced.\"\nGraf, a cardiologist who helped establish the modern system of paramedic emergency care, died Oct. 18 at his Los Angeles home, family members said. He was 98.\nGraf was former chief of staff for the Daniel Freeman Hospital. In the 1960s, he established what was thought to be the West Coast's first dedicated coronary care units there and later created the groundbreaking Daniel Freeman Paramedic Training Program. In 1999, it merged with the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care.\nIn 1969, Graf, who was then president of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Heart Assn., converted a white Chevy van into a \"mobile critical care unit.\"\nThe idea was to speed to heart attack calls with a Daniel Freeman nurse and a portable defibrillator. Later, training was expanded to include firefighters and emergency medical technicians — groups that, according to Graf's studies, performed just as well as nurses at saving cardiac patients.\n\"It's easy to take for granted the incredibly elaborate, sophisticated EMS system that we have today, but just 50 years ago, it did not exist,\" Dr. Clayton Kazan, the medical director for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said in a statement. \"While ambulance transportation existed, virtually no medical care was provided until the patient arrived at the hospital.\"\nGraf's \"Heart Car\" — named for its Heart Emergency Assistance Response Team — helped spark \"a movement that has been responsible for saving innumerable lives worldwide,\" Kazan said.\nIn 2010, Graf and three other physicians were honored by the County of Los Angeles Fire Museum as \"pioneers in paramedicine.\" The others were J. Michael Criley, Eugene Nagel and Leonard Cobb.\nIn interviews, Graf said he was inspired by the work of Irish physician Frank Pantridge, who chronicled his success with emergency care in a British medical journal.\n\"Amazingly, the reaction of the British medical establishment consisted for the most part of disbelief, ridicule and even hostility,\" the Guardian, a British newspaper, noted in its 2005 obituary of Pantridge.\n\"It was to be 16 years before the concept of taking the care to the patient was fully accepted,\" the Guardian wrote. \"The reaction in America was totally different, and the creation of mobile units was both swift and comprehensive.\"\nBorn in New York City on July 15, 1917, Graf grew up in the Bronx, the son of a jewelry designer for high-end stores like Tiffany & Co. He attended the City College of New York.\nWhen his father wound up unemployed in the Depression, Graf sought work for him in San Francisco, where he hoped to go to medical school. Graf found his father a job, asked a dean at City College for his father's $50 bus fare, and hoped for the best.\n\"I put my daddy on the bus and kissed the bus,\" he said in an oral history videotaped for his family this year. \"A few months later, he sent money for us to join him.\"\nGraf received his medical degree from UC San Francisco in 1942. He served as an Army physician in Europe and North Africa.\nIn California, Graf taught medicine at the University of Southern California and Loma Linda University. He had a thriving cardiology practice, and one of his longtime patients was Kenneth Hahn, a former Los Angeles County supervisor.\nIt was Hahn who pushed Gov. Ronald Reagan to sign a 1970 bill allowing trained personnel other than doctors and nurses to administer emergency care. Graf helped write the bill, which established a pilot program in Los Angeles County.\nFacing opposition from doctors, nurses and lawyers, Reagan asked Hahn whether ambulances would be allowed to cross city lines in L.A. County. Then he OKd the measure, recalling that his father, Jack Reagan, had died of a heart attack in 1940 when a Los Angeles ambulance was restricted from crossing into Beverly Hills, where he had been stricken.\nGraf's survivors include his wife, Joan; nine children and stepchildren; 19 grandchildren; and 22 great-grandchildren. He had three previous marriages."

Our thoughts and prayers are with the Kaczynski family, the loved ones of those killed in this tragic plane crash, and the Polish nation.\nToday’s loss is devastating to Poland, to the United States, and to the world. President Kaczynski was a distinguished statesman who played a key role in the Solidarity movement, and he was widely admired in the United States as a leader dedicated to advancing freedom and human dignity. With him were many of Poland’s most distinguished civilian and military leaders who have helped to shape Poland’s inspiring democratic transformation. We join all the people of Poland in mourning their passing.\nToday, there are heavy hearts across America. The United States cherishes its deep and abiding bonds with the people of Poland. Those bonds are represented in the strength of our alliance, the friendships among our people, and the extraordinary contributions of Polish-Americans who have helped to shape our nation.\nIt is a testament to the strength of the Polish people that those who were lost were travelling to commemorate a devastating massacre of World War II as the leaders of a strong, vibrant, and free Poland. That strength will ensure that Poland emerges from the depths of this unthinkable tragedy, and that the legacy of the leaders who died today will be a light that continues to guide Poland – and the world – in the direction of human progress.\n\"I think the whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of the tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife Maria and the party that were with them,\" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. \"We know the difficulties that Poland has gone through, the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement.

        "text": "Big news in the world of food policy, farming and antibiotic use: Perdue Farms, the third-largest chicken producer in the United States, announced today that during the past decade it has ceased using most of the antibiotics that formerly propped up its chicken production.\nThere are caveats to that \"most,\" and I'll explain them. But it's important to say up front that this is a nationally significant move and looks like an industry-leading step.\ninjecting meat chickens with antibiotics while still in the shell.\nThose restrictions mean the company has eliminated most of the uses of antibiotics that public health campaigners have been concerned about since the 1970s, and has gone beyond current federal requirements for what can be done to meat chickens before they hatch. And while the impact probably can't be measured with precision as long as other firms continue to use antibiotics routinely, it seems likely that Perdue has taken an important step in reducing the amount of antibiotic resistance that comes off farms and causes human illness.\nThe company said it began its antibiotic reduction program 12 years ago. The trigger for today's announcement was completing the removal of antibiotic use from its hatcheries, which was a five-year project that ended this summer.\n\"When we started hearing from consumers that they were becoming concerned about the amount of antibiotics used to raise chickens they were buying, we were listening,\" company chairman Jim Perdue said at the DC briefing. \"Coupled with information coming from the USDA and FDA and other sources, we began to look critically at our practices. It wasn't easy...but we found along the way that we could raise healthy chickens with fewer antibiotics.\"\nRoutine antibiotic use in meat production – that is, giving meat animals small doses of antibiotics every day in food or water, to make them put on weight faster and to prevent disease from the conditions they live in – has been under scrutiny for decades. The first federal action addressing it happened just last December, when the FDA asked veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturers to relabel the antibiotics they make, so that \"growth promotion\" – that weight-gain use – would become an unapproved, technically illegal use of the drug.\nThe concern that lies behind routine animal antibiotic use is that most of the drugs used on farms are the same ones used against infections that humans develop. Bacteria in animals' guts or on their skin develop resistance to protect themselves; when the animals are slaughtered, or their manure washes or wafts off the farm property, the resistant bacteria go along too. When humans pick up those bacteria from meat or the environment, they can't be treated – because the drug needed to cure them is the same one that was used on the farm in the first place.\nThe \"ionophore exception\" is why the Perdue announcement and release today included words like \"fewer\" from Perdue himself, and statements like this from Dr. Bruce Stewart-Brown, Senior Vice President of Food Safety, Quality and Live Operations: “By no longer using any antibiotics in our hatcheries or any human antibiotics in feed, we’ve reached the point where 95 percent of our chickens never receive any human antibiotics, and the remainder receive them only for a few days when prescribed by a veterinarian.\"\nStewart-Brown said during the briefing that the company's ionophore use is also trending down, but wasn't willing to give figures. The only birds to receive the ionophores, he said, are the company's regular brand of chicken; neither the organic nor the \"no antibiotics ever\" lines do. However, he said, animals that get sick will be treated with antibiotics if the company's veterinarians think it is needed, but then will be sold under the regular brand.\nTo compensate for the lost effect of the antibiotics the company relinquished, Stewart-Brown said they also improved chickens' diets by removing animal byproducts and going to an all-vegetable feed of soybean meal and corn oil; using prebiotics and probiotics including \"oregano and yucca\" and \"yogurt type things\"; increasing the number of vaccinations chickens receive; and doubling down on cleaning chicken \"houses,\" the long sheds that can hold tens of thousands of broilers at a time.\n\"This doesn't mean we are done,\" he said. \"We constantly learn new things and try to evolve our program.\"\nCampaigners for reduced antibiotic use mostly supported the comprehensive moves.\nGail Hansen, a public health veterinarian with the Pew Charitable Trusts, told me: \"This is a lot of what we have been asking for, for six years, so it is pretty positive,\" adding that she would like to see the company be more specific about the amounts of ionophores it uses and about better husbandry practices that could help boost broiler chickens' immune systems.\nCaroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said: \"The amount of antibiotics used on the farm is simply not sustainable if we want to preserve their uses in human medicine. I hope Perdue's actions foreshadow changes across the industry, and embolden regulators to prohibit the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture.\"\nJonathan Kaplan, Natural Resources Defense Council: \"Jim Perdue [says]:'… human-approved antibiotics should not be used to boost production or in place of responsible animal husbandry or hatchery management.' We agree!.... We’d like to hear more about how Perdue is verifying these accomplishments and hope the company will also publish its actual antibiotic use data.\"\nSusan Vaughn Grooters of Keep Antibiotics Working praised the moves but raised a concern about birds that are outside Perdue's system but feed into it: the great-grandparent and grandparent birds that maintain the lines Perdue uses to create its broilers' parents.\n\"Reducing antibiotics use is laudable, but we won't fully address threats to human health until we're looking at the whole poultry production system, including breeders,\" she told me. \"Purdue mentioned that they don't own the grandparent breeding flocks that supply to them. Consumers should be concerned with this black box. Through purchasing specifications and breeder production agreements, Purdue could further drive down antibiotic use in food animal production by addressing that use.\"\nIn a follow-up interview, Stewart-Brown said: \"We are not in the genetics business, but one thing we are really clear on (with the breeding companies) is we believe it is very important they are breeding in such a way that the parents and the progeny from those parents are as hearty and capable. They understand, when we are buying their product, that we need birds that will be healthy enough not to need the help of antibiotics.\""

One solution: Matching customers with service reps for more harmonious calls.\nYou hear the recording whenever you phone customer support: \"Calls may be recorded for training and quality purposes.\" Of course, companies use call center recordings for training and compliance purposes, but they could do a lot more with this data.\nOr so says Jason Wesbecher, chief marketing officer of Mattersight, a Chicago-based developer of personality-based applications for call centers. The company’s novel Behavioral Analytics software captures and examines a variety of contextual data, including voice calls from customers, to route callers to the best available representative -- at least from a personality-match standpoint.\n\"When you think of big data, there's a ton of data in that spoken conversation. No one is taking that data and trying to operationalize it in a new way,\" Wesbecher told InformationWeek in a phone interview. \"Call-recording vendors are out there, but they're not focused on this kind of behavioral science angle.\"\nMattersight's cloud-based analytics, based on millions of proprietary algorithms as well as a set of behavioral models, can determine if a caller is outgoing, sarcastic, serious, or shy, the company claims. Its software is used by major retailers and insurers, including CVS Pharmacy and Esurance, a division of Allstate.\n\"There are a quarter-billion phone calls every day between American brands and their consumers, so there’s a lot of conversation happening,\" said Wesbecher. \"For our customers, we're applying psychology and behavioral science to the phone call, and we're able to tell them, across a vast set of data, the health of those customer conversations based on psychological and behavioral attributes.\"\nHere's how it works: Based on the words they use and how they use them, customers are classified within one of about a half-dozen personality constructs. This tells the company how the caller likes to communicate.\n\"What are their distress triggers? And what's the best way to de-escalate a situation they might be having, which in the call center business is really important right now,\" Wesbecher said.\nMattersight works with the call center in two ways. First, over a one- to two-week period, it captures key data patterns, including how individual call center reps handle certain personality styles.\nAcross a variety of phone calls, Mattersight identifies emerging patterns that indicate a service rep's ability to handle different personalities.\nThe company has a second product offering, where it comes in and looks at its client's historical call center data.\n\"We'll cross-reference it with our database of personalities and phone numbers,\" Wesbecher said. The goal is to pair two personalities -- caller and rep -- a match designed to generate shorter, more effective support calls.\n\"In this case, we don't actually present any information to the call center employee,\" said Wesbecher. \"We just create more magical connections by pairing, right when the caller calls in, that [customer] with the service rep.\"\nMattersight plans to extend its Behavioral Analytics software beyond the call center and into the world of social media.\n\"There are 150 million daily active users of Facebook in the United States and Canada, creating mountains of user-generated content every day,\" said Wesbecher. \"How can we take this behavioral profiling equation, and use it as an attribute for brands to better communicate, from an advertising standpoint, with the consumer on Facebook?\"\nOne retailer, for instance, might adopt two distinct marketing strategies to reach different personality types.\n\"We might get an ad from the same brand, but your ad will be totally different from my ad, given our personality files,\" Wesbecher said. \"Mine might be full of bullet points and facts, and yours might be a family sitting around a Christmas tree, toasting. You could start segmenting the user population based on the text they're generating.\"\n\"I have also experienced that IVR was a good tool which can take a lot of load from the agents but I have felt that because of so many service offerings, the IVR has become so much complex that I feel it takes lesser time to get connected to a call center agent nevertheless we have to wait quite long to hear agent's voice.\"\nNomii, IVR is a good option and applicable only for limited queries like knowing last 5 transactions, balance in account, blocking the card, regenerating the PIN, complaint registration etc. But may not be feasible for extensive queries like rectification of wrong entry, reversal of fine/charges etc.\n\"I think not only the calls which are made to the call center should be recorded but also the personal visits to the clients so that it can be tracked that what commitment is made by which customer representative. Secondly the effected customer should be compensated.\"\nNomii, second option is attractive. Around 90% of all these businesses are happens at client side through various selling agents. So recording may not be feasible, instead of that clear cut writing is fair enough. I mean whatever may be the comments or comments from selling peoples; that should be captured in written form for later reference.\nI have also experienced that IVR was a good tool which can take a lot of load from the agents but I have felt that because of so many service offerings, the IVR has become so much complex that I feel it takes lesser time to get connected to a call center agent nevertheless we have to wait quite long to hear agent's voice.\nI think not only the calls which are made to the call center should be recorded but also the personal visits to the clients so that it can be tracked that what commitment is made by which customer representative. Secondly the effected customer should be compensated.\n\"I agree that there can be many other ways of using the recorded calls. Like it can help to check which kind of customer request takes the longest time or which information is requested frequently so that its response time can be reduced. If I am call center agent and I get a call, the frequently requested information should get automatically displayed on my dashboard by detecting the number of the caller.\"\n\"Yes the companies have a serious problem of making wrong commitments and I have also been its victim while getting my first credit card. I think this is the result of weak internal processes that they cannot restrict such misconducts. Secondly if the companies are bound to pay huge fines in case of such incidents, than they will seriously address this issue.\"\nNomii, most of the peoples are victims of such wrong commitments from business team. To moot business and to attract customers, orally they used to offer various benefits and commitments. But nothing either in written or records; Later they used to deny also.\nYes the companies have a serious problem of making wrong commitments and I have also been its victim while getting my first credit card. I think this is the result of weak internal processes that they cannot restrict such misconducts. Secondly if the companies are bound to pay huge fines in case of such incidents, than they will seriously address this issue.\n\"I believe that in normal cases the call center may not have the policy to replay the recording to the customers. I know a friend working in a call center and their recorded calls are randomly picked for quality review. And they are only allowed to replay the voice if the issue is escalated to a higher level.\"\nI think the data remains unstructured until it is not in the radar of the companies. Once such data gets into radar and some time is spent over them than they start becoming structured. This stage would only come once the data and its related benefits are identified.\nThere is so much potential when we look at not only leveraging structured data, but also garnering nuggets from unstructured sources including the voice recordings. A recent IDG SAS survey showed that most organizations have a desire to increase their utilization in these areas. However, maturity levels do present challenges. I look forward to seeing how organizations move forward in this space."

        "text": "A small Russian software company learns that Adobe doesn't pull its punches when an engineer is arrested for creating a program to crack the eBook format.\nAttention, software pirates, security researchers and those out to prove a point: Adobe Systems doesn't pull its punches.\nThat's the lesson Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian software programmer, learned Monday when FBI agents arrested him in Las Vegas for allegedly publishing a program that removes the security protections from Adobe eBook files. The bureau said such activity was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nSklyarov, who has been moved to San Jose, Calif., for trial, is the latest casualty in a fight between software maker Adobe and Elcom, a 20-person company in Moscow.\nThe jailed programmer is one of the authors of the Advanced eBook Processor, an application designed to strip various security measures from Adobe's eBook format, a function that Elcom claims is necessary to allow backups required by Russian law and that Adobe claims is tantamount to software piracy.\n\"Adobe would like to make great money on the eBook market but used an absolutely improper format for that: PDF,\" Vladamir Katalov, managing director of Elcom, said in an e-mail interview with CNET News.com. That's \"really nice, but not secure. And by pushing it, they simply create a lot of trouble (for) publishers and authors.\"\nThe jailed programmer Sklyarov had outlined problems with Adobe eBook and PDF security in a paper presented at the Def Con hacker convention.\nElcom's claim that the company had benign intentions is dodging the issue, said Adobe spokeswoman Susan Altman Prescott.\n\"The truth is that piracy is not a new issue, and copy protection of digital content is not a new issue,\" she said. \"No software on the market is 100 percent secure against a determined hacker. We are not new to this business. We understand the nature of copyright violation and how to prevent it.\"\nSklyarov's arrest comes three weeks after Adobe sent notices requesting that Elcom stop selling the program and demanding that Verio, Elcom's Internet service provider, disconnect the company's Web site.\nThe notice sent to Elcom on June 25 gave the company five days to remove the software from its site, but Verio removed the site the next day. While Elcom's Katalov said the company complied with Adobe's demands--selling fewer than 10 copies of its program before the software was pulled--its credit card service was soon suspended as well.\nOn June 26, according to the affidavit filed in the Northern District of California, Adobe requested an investigation by the FBI into Elcom's activities. After several demonstrations that the program did, indeed, remove the security of eBook files, FBI agent Daniel O'Connell filed his affidavit July 11, a day before registration opened at Def Con.\nAdobe, for its part, would not confirm its role in the investigation.\n\"The issue is not one of Adobe vs. a software hacker,\" said Adobe's Prescott. \"At issue is copyright protection for artists and publishers.\"\nWhile Prescott first portrayed Adobe as somewhat removed from the investigation, she later acknowledged that the company \"brought it to the attention of the U.S. government.\" The FBI affidavit, however, shows that Adobe seems to be the only victim in the case and had at least three people working on gathering information about Elcom's software for investigators.\nOnly the second case to be filed under the criminal provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the strongest law to date supporting publishers of copyrighted content, the trial could be an important testing ground for the DMCA, said Jennifer Granick, clinical director of Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society.\n\"It's the DeCSS case but criminal,\" she said, referring to the New York case that is trying Web sites that linked to code that could break the encryption on DVD movies. \"The fact that it is someone from outside the country highlights the problems with the law, because this is the U.S. enforcing its laws on another country.\"\nGranick believes the case highlights an important weakness in the DMCA.\n\"Companies are allowed to take fair use away with our technology,\" she said, \"but we are not allowed to take fair use back with technology.\""

Capgrave is adapting the etymology of Katherine's name provided in Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda aurea.\n250 It is more sykyr a bryd in youre fyste. The first known record of the popular proverb,\"A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.\" See Whiting, Proverbs, B301. The speaker continues with two more proverbs,\"The gray hors whyl his gras growyth / May sterve for hunger\" (lines 253-54; compare Proverbs, G437) and\"The sore may swelle long or the herbe / Is growe or rype\" (lines 256-57; compare Proverbs, S504).\n260 now.

Goddys grace. Daniel's dealings with Nebuchadnezzar are recounted in Daniel 1-4. According to Daniel 6, Darius (not Nebuchadnezzar) threw Daniel to the lions.\n510-67 Capgrave is establishing Katherine's propensity towards conversion: her know-ledge of and respect for Scripture (Genesis, Daniel), her desire to know more about Daniel's god, and her purely perfunctory reverence for her own pagan gods (lines 564-67). Katherine's study of Scripture, however, might have made her a problematic example for fifteenth-century lay readers.\n580 Ovyde seyde.

Capgrave may be alluding to popular representations of Katherine of Alexandria trampling the emperor Maxentius. See Introduction, p. 2.\n825 Aristoteles Elenkes. Aristotle's De sophisticis elenchis (On Sophistical Refutations) was a standard textbook for late-medieval students of dialectic. Aristotle dissects the various rhetorical tricks employed by sophists, whom he defines as people who wish to appear wise without actually being so. In so doing he pro-vides a veritable treasure trove of rhetorical fallacies, which Katherine accuses her opponent of using.\n909 othir that have abyden long. Capgrave evokes the stories of various lovers (Troilus, for example, or Dido) whose initial resistance to love resulted in a tragic romance.\n958-59 mo wyse hedes.... the bettir is it. Proverbial. See Whiting, Proverbs, H227.\n961-93 qwy / That o man above many shall have governing.... cuntré abowte. The view that kingship results from the voluntary submission of free people to another's authority (pactum subjectionis) is found in the work of various late-medieval political theorists, including Marsilius of Padua (Defensor pacis, especially 1.8-9), Duns Scotus (Ordinatio 4.15.2), and Nicholas of Cusa (Concordantia, especially 2.21-41, 3.4). The idea goes back to Greek and Roman times, for example, Cicero's De officiis (especially 2.21-41) and Aristotle's Politics (especially 3.14). For general discussions of consent theories and related matters, see Jeannine Quillet, \"Community, Counsel and Representation,\" in The Cambridge History of Medieval Political Thought, c. 350-c. 1450, ed. J. H. Burns (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), pp. 520-72; and Anthony Black, Political Thought in Europe, 1250-1450 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 136-85.\n994 thei.

        "text": "An inmate makes a phone call from his cell at the Orange County jail in Santa Ana, California, May 24, 2011.\nThe New York City Council voted this week to provide free telephone calls for anyone held in the city’s correctional facilities. The move will save New York City inmates and their families an estimated US$8 million a year.\nUntil this law takes effect, phone services in the city’s jails will continue to be provided by Securus Technologies which, like other private companies, charges inmates and their families, the ultimate ‘captive customers’, at higher than average rates.\nCurrently, Securus charges an initial fee of 50 cents, plus 5 cents per minute for calls within New York, as well as fees for depositing funds. The cost of calls can quickly become prohibitive. With black people and Latinos making up over 86% of inmates in New York City, communities of color primarily bear these high costs. Many already lived in poverty before their arrests, and are held in pre-trial detention simply because they cannot afford to pay bail.\nThe new law will also prohibit the city from making revenue for itself on phone call fees. City government had a revenue sharing agreement with Securus, which guaranteed the city at least $5 million in income each year.\nPhone calls provide an important link between people in custody and their families. Inmates that maintain family ties have an easier re-entry process, and may be less likely to reoffend. Children also benefit from having regular contact with parents in prison. The city should not look to raise revenues by charging people for these vital connections, nor should low income families be forced to sacrifice basic necessities to pay for calls.\nLast year, a court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission cannot set caps on the cost of in-state prison phone calls, leaving it to each state and local jurisdiction to set the fees. New York City is among the first jurisdictions to eliminate fees altogether, and prohibit revenue sharing contracts. In the absence of national legislation, other cities and states should follow suit. People in custody should be able to stay in touch with their families without paying an exorbitant price."

On the first episode of Complex&apos;s newest show, Open Late, hosted by Peter Rosenberg, Rocky went into his bag and broke out a pair of Nike SB sneakers from 2005.\nThe sneakers are street artist Futura&apos;s collaboration on Paul Rodriguez&apos;s first signature shoe, the Nike Zoom P Rod 1. They feature a grey and black upper with patent leather and Futura&apos;s artwork.\nWhat makes them special is that, while they used to be insanely hyped, they&apos;ve cooled down over the years. No one&apos;s checking for Nike SB anymore, although instances of the sneakers conjure up feelings of yesteryear: a day and age before you could purchase full size runs of the latest and greatest shoe without the aide of a bot.\nThis isn&apos;t the only skate shoe Rocky has worn recently, however. He also sported an all-black pair of the Osiris D3, the signature shoe of pro skater Dave Mayhew, which first released in 2001 and that many consider the ugliest skate shoe of all-time. The shoe&apos;s from an era where many skate shoes were overdone: full of questionably functional air pockets, fat tongues, and covered in plastic. Mall kids still bought them by the boatloads, and Osiris was a West Coast movement in Southern California in the early 2000s.\nBut if Rocky can pull them off, others will try to as well.\nIf you want to hear Rosenberg&apos;s thoughts on sneakers, watch his episode of Sole Collector&apos;s Full Size Run below."

Fields had been photographed hours beforehand with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that took part, although the group denied any association with him.\nFields already faces state charges including first-degree murder. He has been in custody since the rally."

        "text": "Loss of taste sensation occurs in about 85 percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. A new Stanford study explored the problem.\nThe holidays are a time of feasting for many people. You might be thinking fondly right about now of a fantastic meal from last week (prime rib, anyone?) or eagerly anticipating a quiet lunch of leftovers. Not so for cancer patients recovering from chemotherapy. Not only can the treatment lead to nausea, many patients also lose their sense of taste and struggle to eat enough to support their recovery.\nStanford stem cell biologist Philip Beachy, PhD, and instructor Wan-Jin Lu, PhD, wondered about the role of a critical developmental signaling protein called Hedgehog in this loss of taste. Previous work in Beachy's lab showed that the Hedgehog signaling pathway is often misregulated in cancers, and treatment of certain tumors involves specifically blocking the Hedgehog pathway. They published new findings on taste last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nLoss of taste sensation occurs in about 85 percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and is a significant clinical issue because it causes loss of appetite, unwanted weight reduction, and complications in recovery. In addition to the widespread loss of taste from traditional cancer therapy, a particularly interesting manifestation of taste disturbance occurs in cancer patients treated with Hedgehog (Hh) pathway antagonists, which our lab discovered and helped develop.\nOur sense of taste relies on taste receptor cells clustered in taste buds along our tongues. They're meant to let us know not just when things taste good, but also when something is spoiled or potentially toxic (no, I don't think you can count your cousin's noxious green bean casserole). Due to their role on the frontline of our digestive system, the taste receptor cells undergo a fairly high turnover rate -- dying and being replaced within a period of just a few days or weeks.\nThese taste receptors relay the taste information they sense to the brain via connections to a cranial ganglion (a cluster of nerve cells behind the ear). But information also flows in the other direction. In fact, it has long been known that the maintenance of the taste receptor cells requires this connection to the ganglion. Why this is hasn't been clear. Beachy and Lu studied laboratory mice to learn that drugs or genetic manipulations that block the response to the Hedgehog signal delivered by the nerves stops the regeneration of taste receptor cells, leading to an eventual die-off of the cells and a loss of taste.\nWe found that sensory organs critically rely on a signal, the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein, that is delivered to the tongue epithelium by ganglion neurons that send projections from their cell bodies into the tongue. The pattern of the projections carrying the Shh signal provides spatial guidance for the regeneration of taste organs.\nChemotherapy patients do eventually regain their sense of taste after their treatment is stopped, but it can take several weeks. Beachy and Lu showed that administering drugs that amp up the Hedgehog pathway signaling in mice caused a much more rapid regeneration of the taste receptor cells on the tongue.\n\"Our findings illustrate a new biological principle, namely, that stable and robust organ patterning in tissues with a high rate of turnover can be specified by neuronal delivery of a regenerative signal to precise locations,\" Beachy told me. \"In addition, our findings suggest that pharmacologic Hedgehog pathway activation may provide a means to accelerate taste recovery in the many cancer patients who lose taste sensation after chemotherapy.\""

His two older sisters both competed in the district spelling bee.\n\"We always study the root words, origins and definitions before we start spelling,\" she said.\nParents, siblings and teachers filled the Kirby-Smith Center boardroom as each speller took his or her turn at the microphone.\nSchool Board member Carol Oyenarte said she was proud of all the students who participated and their parents for supporting them.\n\"It was so exciting,\" she said. \"I'm not as smart as a fifth-grader. Every one of them were a winner to get that far — and those were hard words.\"\nMadison Ragsdale, an Alachua Elementary School student, was the first student up. She misspelled \"writhe.\"\nAfter the round, announcer Tim McShane leaned over to her.\n\"It starts with a ‘w,' \" he said as she left.\nDebbie Lewis, former School Board member Ginger Childs and retired Principal Gladys Wright served as judges.\nOrganizer Dawn Newell said the spelling bee is just as nerve-wracking for her as it is for the students.\n\"It just kills me,\" she said. \"I'm not a speller. It just breaks my heart.\"\nCasey Jones, 11, froze on the word euphonious. Casey, a sixth-grader at Howard Bishop Middle School, said he didn't know the word.\n\"I was a proud mama,\" said Nekia Jones. \"Even though he didn't get it, I was proud.\"\nOutside the ballroom, Whyatt Warnock, 12, asked his mother, Debbie Roberts, how to spell the word that knocked him out. \"Is it f-l-a-g-e-l-l-u-m?\" he asked. This time he spelled it right. \"Of course I get it afterwards.\"\nMeenali Patel, a fifth-grader at Oak View, landed in the top three but tripped over the word tamale. \"You rushed a little bit,\" said her father, Vince Patel. \"But we made it to the finals.\"\nBoth Meenali and Alexandra Ro of Oak Hall School were runners-up.\nPierce said he didn't know the meaning of geta, a traditional Japanese shoe resembling clogs and flip-flops. Now that he has moved to the next round, there's more etymology — the study of words — in his future.\n\"I plan to study a whole lot,\" he said. \"When I get there, I just want to keep my focus.\""

        "text": "BRIDGETON - Murder defendant Jeremiah E. Monell will wait until Monday to see whether a judge will let him out of Cumberland County Jail while his highly publicized case moves through the pre-trial process.\nMonell, whose 15-day flight from arrest ended Jan. 2, was given an initial hearing at 2 p.m. Wednesday before Cumberland County Superior Court Judge Cristen D’Arrigo. The court reviewed the charges state police filed on Dec. 19, 2016 and what legal representation Monell intends to have.\nThe defendant unexpectedly did not come to court but appeared via video from the county jail along with defense attorney Lindsey Seidel for the hearing.\nMonell will get a pre-trial detention hearing before D’Arrigo at 9 a.m. Monday. The judge at the time will hear from county Assistant Prosecutors Michael Ostrowski and Brent Hopkins why he should not be allowed to leave jail. Monell, 32, of Cedarville, is charged with first-degree murder and other offenses in the stabbing death of his estranged wife Tara O'Shea-Watson in their home in the Laurel Lake section of Commercial Township.\nMonell said he would reside with his father in Pittsgrove if released. Bail was set at $1 million for him in December.\nA new state law that took effect this month allows the matter of detention before trial to be taken up at a separate hearing, and county prosecutors intend to handle it that way.\nUnder new bail reform rules effective for anyone arrested as of Jan. 1, the accused won’t have to pay bail to get out.\nThose facing lower level charges will be released pending trial. Those accused of more serious crimes will go through a risk assessment and appear before a judge.\nIf they're deemed too dangerous or unlikely to show up for court, they'll be kept in jail until trial.\nMost courtroom seats were filled for the hearing, among them relatives of the murder victim. County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae and First Assistant Prosecutor Harold Shapiro observed the hearing sitting with relatives.\nBryan Dunn, a cousin of the victim, was among relatives in court for the hearing. He spoke afterward for the family with reporters.\n\"We are happy that he is in custody,\" said Dunn, a Clayton resident. \"We're just waiting for justice.\"\nDunn said relatives and friends are in constant contact since the murder.\n\"And we are a tight-knit family,\" he said. \"Anybody can tell you that.\"\nDunn said his cousin was divorcing Monell.\nEven knowing what O'Shea-Watson was going through with Monell, Dunn said her murder was a shock.\n\"She was supposed to be in Tennessee but the justice system has failed her in that departure,\" he said. \"She wasn't leaving without the children.\"\nWebb-McRae could not comment on Monell's health. He was taken to Inspira Medical Center Vineland after his capture Monday afternoon in Folsom Borough.\nThe prosecutor declined comment on the circumstances of his arrest.\nNew Jersey State Police called to her house on the morning of Dec. 19 reported finding O’Shea-Watson unresponsive and unconscious.\nState troopers captured Monell Monday in response to a tip, ending a 15-day manhunt. Monell was found hiding in woods."

        "text": "Until now, birds got nearly all the credit for keeping organic coffee plantations where pesticides are banned insect-free, but a study from the University of Michigan has shown that during the summer wet season, bats eat more bugs than the birds at Finca Irlanda, a 740-acre organic coffee plantation in Chiapas, Mexico.\nThis is just one example of a great \"ecological service\" that went unnoticed until now. How many more do we benefit from without realizing it? Sadly, bat populations are declining worldwide, and the small flying mammals never got the love they deserve.\nBut why didn't we realize sooner that bats were doing the job? After all, we already know they're a good way to get rid of insects.\nn previous experiments, the exclosures---simply net-covered wood-and-plastic frameworks---were placed over coffee bushes around-the-clock. After several days, scientists counted the insects on the protected plants and compared the tally to totals from nearby unprotected plants. The protected plants usually had higher pest counts, and birds generally received the credit.\nBut because the netting remained in place day and night, bats also had been excluded, Williams-GuilleÌn said. And their impact went unnoticed.\nSo to examine each variable, a new experiment was devised where different types of nets were used at different times to exclude just birds, just bats, etc. Resulst: during the summer wet season, the bat-only exclosures resulted in an 84 percent increase in the density of insects, spiders, harvestmen and mites---exceeding the impact of birds.\nSo the next time you are drinking shade-grown organic coffee, think of bats."

Garrett finished higher than he was ranked. He had a great mindset going in and ran very well. I was really proud of him.

        "text": "1. REVENUE UP: Wells Fargo’s fourth-quarter revenue of $21.4 billion beat analysts’ expectations of $21.2 billion. The company’s executives pointed to signs of strength in the U.S. economy, as revenue rose in all three of Wells Fargo’s primary business segments: community banking; wholesale banking; and wealth, brokerage and retirement.\nCEO John Stumpf, speaking on a conference call with investors, gave an overall upbeat assessment of the economy. He cited, among other things, consumer confidence being at its highest level since the recession.\n2. MORTGAGE LENDING STILL DOWN: Because it’s such a large home-loan lender, Wells Fargo is seen as a bellwether for the U.S. housing market. Like other lenders, it continues to cope with overall lower mortgage originations following the drop in demand to originate refinancing loans.\nWells Fargo said it originated $44 billion in home loans in the fourth quarter, including those for purchases and refinancings, a decline of 12 percent from the same quarter a year ago. That’s also down 8 percent from the third quarter of this year. To put that in some perspective, mortgage banking fees made up 15 percent of the bank’s total fee income in the fourth quarter.\n3. LENDING PROFITABILITY SQUEEZED: Wells Fargo grew its total average loans by 4 percent from a year earlier and its average core deposits by 7.3 percent. All that deposit growth sounds good, but it has hurt the bank’s net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability. The figure represents the difference between what a banks pays on deposits and receives for loans.\nThe net interest margin of a bank can shrink when deposits grow faster than loans. Sluggish loan growth and low interest rates have been squeezing net interest margins at banks.\nChief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said Wednesday that if Wells Fargo sees more high deposit growth and lending doesn’t keep pace, more pressure will be put on the net interest margin.\n4. RESERVE RELEASES ARE FALLING: Wells Fargo, like other lenders, continues to rely less on using so-called “reserve” releases as a tool to help boost its earnings.\nAs borrowers have done a better job of repaying loans, banks have been able to “release” the money they’ve set aside to cover bad loans. But the amount that banks are releasing continues to fall and it remains unclear whether they will be able to continue releasing reserves.\nIn the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo released $250 million, down from $600 million a year earlier. Shrewsberry said it’s possible the bank could have more reserve releases in the future but also that it might need to do the opposite: add to its reserves to cover possible losses as it grows its loans.\n5. FALLING OIL PRICES NOT A CONCERN: Some analysts Wednesday asked Stumpf and Shrewsberry whether falling oil prices would hurt Wells Fargo.\nFalling oil prices have been good for consumers, lowering gasoline prices. But as oil prices have fallen, investors have wondered whether it could lead to losses on loans banks have made to the energy industry.\nStumpf said only about 2 percent of Wells Fargo’s loans are tied to the oil and gas industry. He said the drop in oil prices is “a real benefit” to Wells Fargo’s millions of customers.\nWells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, was among the first lenders to kick off the latest earnings season for the largest U.S. financial institutions, giving investors a glimpse of what they might expect from their big-bank peers.\nNew York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. also reported fourth-quarter results Wednesday. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, posted a 6.6 percent decline in profit, as its legal costs rose.\nCharlotte remains Wells Fargo’s largest employment base, the result of its 2008 purchase of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Wells Fargo grew its Charlotte-area employment by about 1,400 positions last year, bringing the figure to 22,100.\nShares in Wells Fargo fell more than 1 percent Wednesday, closing at $51.25."

If the death toll gets any worse, it will be the deadliest wildfire in California history.\nFirefighters who lost their homes must set aside their grief and work marathon hours to save other residents' lives and houses.\nBut the Camp Fire isn't the only inferno ravaging California. Farther south, fierce winds are expected to fuel two major wildfires west of Los Angeles.\n\"In fact, the strongest Santa Ana winds for the south may come on Tuesday, with gusts to near hurricane force,\" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said.\nThe Camp Fire virtually obliterated the town of Paradise, home to more than 26,000 people.\nAnd with countless homes charred, 10 coroner search-and-recovery teams are helping search for victims' remains, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said.\nBut Sol Bechtold is still holding out hope for his mother Joanne Caddy, who's been missing from Paradise for days.\n\"We learned her house was destroyed the other day, so don't know what's happened to her,\" Bechtold told CNN affiliate KRON. \"She's kind of homebound. She doesn't have a car. I need to find my mom -- I'm not giving up hope she's out there.\"\nMore than 30 Butte County sheriff's deputies reported for duty despite losing their homes, CNN affiliate KTXL reported.\nColusa Police Sgt. Jarrod Hughes told KTXL that his Paradise home had been destroyed in the blaze, but that he had donned his uniform and returned to work once he got his son to safety.\n\"It's my community, it's where I grew up. It's something I absolutely had to do,\" Hughes said. \"There was no question about it. It was get my family to safety so I can get in and get back up there and help everybody else.\"\n• Camp Fire: The largest of the three major blazes, the Camp Fire has scorched 111,000 acres across Northern California and is about 25% contained, according to the state firefighting agency Cal Fire. It has destroyed an estimated 6,700 buildings, most of which were homes.\n• Woolsey and Hill fires: In Southern California, the Woolsey Fire had spread to 85,500 acres and is about 15% contained. The nearby Hill Fire covered 4,531 acres and was 75% contained. Together, the fires are responsible for the destruction of 179 structures, but another 57,000 are threatened, fire officials said.\n• Mass evacuations: More than 300,000 people have been forced from their homes statewide. The majority of those residents are in Los Angeles County, where 170,000 were evacuated.\nAmong those to evacuate were some celebrities whose homes have been lost to the fires.\nThe homes of Miley Cyrus, Neil Young, Robin Thicke and Gerard Butler are among those scorched in the Woolsey blaze. Butler posted a photo on Twitter of the charred remains of a Malibu home and thanked firefighters for their courage.\nThicke posted a statement on Instagram thanking firefighters and volunteers who \"risked their lives trying to save our home.\"\nYoung, in a post on his official website decrying the impact of climate change, said \"I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another.\"\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown also lamented the role of climate change in driving the fires.\n\"This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal,\" Brown said. \"The chickens are coming home to roost, this is real here.\"\nResources, including dozens of fire trucks and thousands of firefighters, are pouring in from out of state.\nThough the state's drought has eased slightly, it's still abnormally dry, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. That leaves a lot of dry vegetation to feed the fires.\nCrews are combing through blackened ruins of homes in the areas scorched by the flames.\nSo far, 29 bodies have been recovered in or near Paradise, which was virtually wiped off the map by the Camp Fire. Many bodies recovered from that fire were found inside or near homes or in vehicles, officials said.\nIn Southern California, officials said two deaths in Malibu were related to the Woolsey Fire, bringing the statewide death toll to 31.\nThe painstaking process of finding the missing and identifying the dead is challenging, with some of the bodies burned beyond recognition.\n\"In some cases, the only remains we are able to recover are bones or bone fragments,\" said Honea, the Butte County sheriff. \"I know that members of the community who are missing loved ones are anxious, and I know that the news of us recovering bodies has to be disconcerting.\""

(And how much we actually grab red pens and paper calendars these days is another topic, though many of us remain devoted to the classic way of time-keeping.) Here's a riddle though: Why would you circle an empty date? For what reason? It might be your birthday, yes, because we humans have a charming way of noting our birthdays on our own calendars. But it also might be February 29, a date chock full of lore and rarity and a bit of calendar-cool cachet. We want to mark it, remember it is coming, and even if we don't have plans, we want to make some.

Quite often when \"29\" comes into play it won't cover a stay, but at both Palomar San Diego and Shorebreak Hotel in Surf City USA, that's the kick-off point for room rates. The Shorebreak is also serving up suites for $229, if that's your pleasure, while Palomar San Diego has a few add-ons at that price point, including a \"60-minute spa treatment at Nature's Spa by Jurlique\" for twenty nine bucks as well as other goodies tagged at that amount. The package at Palomar is called S'Leap, Spa and Dine for $29, while you'll just need to inquire after the Leap Day package at Shorebreak Hotel.

        "text": "Hundreds of Syrians suspected of involvement in anti-army attacks have been swept up, as refugees call raids'unjust'.\nErsal, Lebanon - To Kasem al-Zein, last Thursday was one of his worst days on the job.\nAmid a Lebanese army raid on Sept. 25, the 50-year-old former field doctor with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), who now runs a hospital in Arsal, recalled chaos inside local tent villages housing throngs of Syrian refugees. Tents were invaded and in some cases set ablaze; al-Zein said he treated several patients suffering from smoke inhalation and a young girl with third-degree burns on her leg. By the time troops left, hundreds of males, including children as young as 13, had been rounded up and taken away for questioning.\n\"The situation was very bad,\" al-Zein told Al Jazeera. \"The refugees think the raids are unjust because they haven't done anything wrong.\"\nIN VIDEO: Will the war in Syria spread to Lebanon?\nAccording to the Lebanese army, the Arsal raids resulted in the arrest of 22 Syrian men suspected of involvement in attacks against the army - bringing the total number of Syrians detained in similar raids over the past two weeks to an estimated 450. Dozens more have reportedly been freed after interrogation.\nArsal is the first stop for many civilians fleeing Syria's three-year-old civil war, but its refugee camps have been badly damaged by the ongoing fighting, prompting refugees to seek shelter in the town itself. Last month, Arsal was the scene of a deadly spillover of violence, as clashes killed dozens and rebels captured a group of Lebanese soldiers.\nThe war in Syria has divided Lebanese citizens. Security is a top issue, with skirmishes along the border, and Lebanese residents have become increasingly anxious amid media warnings and rhetoric that paints Syrian refugees as a risk to be contained. Syrian detainees are often accused of either being members of groups such as the al-Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaeda wing fighting President Bashar al-Assad's regime, or supporters of those groups.\nPublic anger towards the Lebanese army's actions in Arsal is concentrated mostly in Sunni areas, especially in northern Lebanon. A demonstration was held in Tripoli last week to protest the army measures.\n\"Resentment here [is] starting to grow,\" said Khaldoun Taleb, the mayor of Fnaydeq, a Sunni town in northern Lebanon - although in general, he noted, residents support the army. \"About 3,000 of our sons are enlisted.\"\nTaleb cited a perceived double-standard with respect to Hezbollah, which sent its men to fight alongside Assad's troops, and Sunni fighters who support the Syrian opposition. Many in Fnaydeq who went to fight with the FSA were questioned by Lebanese army intelligence about their involvement in Syria, he said, while Hezbollah fighters freely cross official checkpoints to take part in battles alongside Assad's regime with no questions asked.\n\"We are starting to question why we are being treated differently,\" Taleb said.\nAmong those detained and later released in Thursday's raids was Syrian refugee Sleiman Khaled, who claimed he was blindfolded, beaten and interrogated by soldiers at an unknown location.\n\"They took all the men randomly,\" he said. \"When we got there they asked for our IDs, and those who had them on hand were separated from those who didn't. They didn't tell us why [we were being detained], only that they suspected we were cooperating with ISIS and Nusra.\"\nAnother Syrian refugee residing in the Asaleya camp in Arsal, who requested anonymity, said soldiers had put a bag over his head when they detained him.\n\"I have nothing to do with ISIL, but that's what the army was accusing us of,\" he said. \"I can accept beatings, but they are doing more than that - they are hurting our dignity.\"\nMeanwhile, security sources said Lebanese soldiers clashed briefly with fighters overnight on Friday after raids on suspected hideouts across border areas, including Wadi Hmeid, on the outskirts of Arsal. One security source, who requested anonymity, confirmed that Syrian warplanes had also carried out air raids on militant hideouts in Wadi Rahwe and Wadi Zamran on Friday morning.\nIn an effort to mitigate rising tensions, Lebanese Army Chief General Jean Kahwagi said the military's actions in Arsal were meant to protect refugees. \"Arsal is not under siege,\" he told reporters after meeting with Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdel-Latif Derian.\nAccording to Aram Nerguizian, a Lebanese Army expert and analyst with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, the army crackdown in Arsal is a necessary measure to root out fighters.\n\"There had been an attack from within the refugee population [in Arsal],\" he said. \"You have something like 38 refugee camps and the LAF [Lebanese Armed Forces] needs to increase its intelligence.... on who's operating [in the camps].\"\nThe army is in the midst of an operation using both air power and intelligence to identify any refugees who may be collaborating with armed groups, he said.\n\"If you have a force within your own territory which could act out, the LAF has to take precautions. The LAF is not out to win a popularity contest; they want to do this as delicately as they can,\" Nerguizian said. \"It's an ugly thing and there's no elegant way to do it. You run the risk of alienating people.\""

        "text": "Local authorities in England say some parents are being “coerced” by schools into home educating their children, often before GCSE exams, and that there has been a sharp increase in the number of pupils being removed, according to the government’s admissions watchdog.\nThe annual report of the Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) says more than 52,000 children were registered as being home schooled in 2017-18, using figures supplied by the 152 local education authorities in England. But it notes that, because there is no requirement on parents to register, the figure is an underestimate of the real total.\nThe figure represents a steep increase from a similar survey in 2015-16 that estimated about 37,000 school-aged children were registered as home educated.\nShan Scott, the chief schools adjudicator, said some local authorities had reported substantial increases “of between 40% to 70% in recent years in the numbers of children electively home educated”.\nOne local authority told the OSA it had received more than 1,000 new registrations in the course of the 2017-18 academic year, and said “many of these are instantly identifiable as inappropriate”.\nCouncils reported that parents had a variety of reasons for home education, including the failure to secure a place at a preferred school. One local authority said that alone accounted for 9% of all home schooling decisions.\nBut “off-rolling” – the practice of a school shifting pupils off its rolls without using formal exclusion processes – was also said to be widespread.\n“In a story echoed by other local authorities, one said ‘it is reported by parents that they have been coerced to become electively home educated’ with some reported instances of schools preparing a standard letter for parents to sign advising of their intention to electively home educate,” the OSA report says.\nScott added: “I was told that that there tended to be an increase in moves towards elective home education during the key stage 4 years.” Key stage 4 – years 10 and 11 – are when pupils study for and sit GCSE exams.\nThe OSA report is the latest evidence of increasing concerns over off-rolling, whether for behavioural or academic reasons. Earlier this week Ofsted announced it would use data to spotlight schools that appeared to be off-rolling pupils, with schools doing so at risk of being downgraded by inspectors.\nAn investigation by the Guardian found that a high-flying grammar school in Bromley, St Olave’s, had been acting unlawfully by pushing out pupils in its sixth form whom it feared might not get top A-level grades and so damage its league table ranking.\nThe OSA also said parents opted for home education because of their child’s anxiety or unhappiness at school, especially as a result of bullying, or concerns about the standard of education. Others said they did so because their child’s special education needs were not being met.\nThe Department for Education last year called for evidence on home schooling practices, and is soon to publish guidance for parents and local authorities that may include compulsory registration.\n“It was clear to me that many local authorities believe that a requirement for home educating parents to register with the local authority would do much to safeguard children,” Scott said.\nThe report also suggested grammar schools were still not doing enough to recruit pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, despite 118 selective schools now giving priority to pupils on free school meals in their admissions process.\n“In some – but not all – cases, there is concern that the proportion of children eligible for the pupil premium securing places at the schools has not increased in the ways hoped for,” Scott said."

Nearly half (44%) of U.S. adults - 81 million people - were either underinsured or uninsured in 2010, up from 75 million in 2007 and 61 million in 2003.\nThe study finds that in addition to covering the uninsured, Affordable Care Act (ACA) reforms will also provide significant relief for those who are underinsured, potentially reducing their numbers by as much as 70 percent once the law is fully implemented.\n\"Under-insured families are at nearly as high risk as the uninsured because, while they have health insurance, holes or limits in their plans expose them to often unaffordable medical costs,\" said lead study author and Commonwealth Fund Senior Vice President Cathy Schoen. \"To reduce the number of under-insured, it will be critical for the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act reforms to keep deductibles and out-of-pocket costs low for essential, effective health care.\"\nAlthough insured all year, underinsured adults reported high rates of access concerns and financial stress. The study finds that the underinsured go without needed health care and struggle to pay medical bills or medical debt at rates at times similar to those without health insurance. Nearly half (46%) of underinsured and 63 percent of uninsured adults didn't fill a prescription, see a doctor when sick, or went without a recommended medical test or treatment, compared with 28 percent of people who had more adequate health insurance. Half (52%) of underinsured and 58 percent of uninsured adults had trouble paying medical bills, were contacted by a collections agency over unpaid bills, had to change their way of life to pay medical bills, or were paying off medical debt over time. In contrast, about one fourth (27%) of adults with adequate health insurance reported such medical bill stress and debt.\nThe study finds that Affordable Care Act reforms like premium assistance and reduced cost-sharing for lower and modest income families will provide significant support to those most likely to be underinsured - people with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or $56,000 a year for a family of four. Seven out of 10 of the underinsured, and a similar share of those uninsured during the year, had incomes this low in the study.\nThe new law will also provide sliding scale premium assistance to families making up to 400 percent of poverty or $88,000 a year for a family of four. However, the study notes that those with incomes above 250 percent of poverty ($56,000 for a family of four) could face out-of-pocket costs that are high relative to their incomes if plan designs permit high deductibles or high cost-sharing for essential care.\n\"Inadequate health insurance puts families' health and financial security at risk,\" said Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis. \"The good news is that the Affordable Care Act includes provision to improve coverage for everyone. If plans are well-designed to cover high-value care, in the future families won't have to live in fear of paying for health insurance that won't protect them when sick - families, especially low and middle income families, will have the greater security of knowing they can afford the health care they need.\"\nLow-income families were most at risk: three quarters of those with incomes below $20,000 were either under-insured (26%) or uninsured (52%).\nHowever, coverage has also eroded for middle income families. By 2010, nearly one out of six (16%) of adults with incomes between $40,000 and $60,000 a year were under-insured and another 19 percent were uninsured. In contrast, in 2003, only 5 percent of adults with incomes in this range were under-insured.\nUnder-insured adults often pay premiums that are high relative to their incomes in addition to facing high deductibles, limits on the number of visits and caps on what the plan will pay in a year. One-third (33%) of underinsured adults reported deductibles of $1,000 or more; 19 percent spent 10 percent or more of their income on premiums.\nThe authors note that the high rates of under-insured are the result of insurance plan designs. They conclude that \"to minimize the risk that newly insured could become underinsured, designs will need to take a value-based approach that ensures access and financial protection for essential care.\"\nStudy data come from the Commonwealth Fund 2010 Health Insurance Survey, a nationally representative telephone survey of 4,005 adults age nineteen and older living in the continental United States. Conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, interviews took place from July 14 to November 30, 2010. We also present trend data from our analyses of the 2003 and 2007 Biennial Health Insurance Surveys (also conducted by the Princeton group).\nThe final sample consisted of 2,550 interviews conducted by landline phone and 1,455 interviews by cell phone, including 637 in households with no land lines. In this study we restricted the analysis to the sample of 3,033 people ages 19 who participated in the survey. The resulting weighted sample represents 184 million adults in this age group.\nFund, Commonwealth. \"Under-Insured Adults Skip Needed Care, Struggle With Medical Debt: Affordable Care Act Reforms Could Have Substantial Impact.\" Medical News Today.

This island has seen a large influx of refugees and migrants, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn recent weeks, the world has been moved by the plight of the Syrians, fleeing a years-long civil war and coming to Europe in search of a better life.\nBut there are many others making similar journeys.\nMashable analyzed data from Eurostat, the EU's data collection agency, to determine where most of the asylum-seekers are coming from.\nIn 2011, Syria, like many other countries in the Middle East, seemed poised to make a revolutionary change. That year was the start of the Arab Spring — where citizens of Arab countries took to the streets to demand change and political freedom. However, the Syrian regime responded with tanks, gunfire and more violence leading to a long conflict.\nAs a result of the war, many Syrians now lack basic access to water, food and medical supplies, according to the World Food Programme. Syria now has over 4 million registered refugees. A majority of the refugees are in countries neighboring Syria, such as Lebanon and Turkey.\nDecades of conflict has given Afghanistan the unfortunate status of having the highest number of refugees in the world. Millions of people have fled Afghanistan, with many going to Iran and Pakistan. Afghanistan is still considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world — especially, for children.\nThough there is no current violent conflict in Kosovo, high rates of unemployment and poverty are driving thousands of people to Europe. Kosovo. Since the bloody conflict between ethnic Albanians and ethnic Serbs in the late 1990's, the country has struggled. The poverty rate in 2007, the most recent year for which data was available, was 45%, according to the World Bank.\nThese applicants are flocking to Germany for a better life. Many of the applicants are ethnic Albanians who cite discrimination and violence as factors for leaving, according to a 2014 report from the European Asylum Support Office.\nThe tens of thousands of asylum seekers from Russia are generally political dissidents — and a majority of them are from Chechnya, according to Jie Zong, a research assistant at the Migration Policy Institute. Chechen refugees have come to Europe since the 1990's when the country went to war with Russia to gain independence. Now under Russian control, Chechenya today is relatively stable, although the government has faced U.S. sanctions over its violation of human rights.\nMany Chechen refugees live in Russia, though others are now looking for a new start in Europe.\nIn the northern region of Pakistan, especially near the border with Afghanistan, there is violence and instability. The Pakistan government is fighting different militant groups in region, including Tehrik-e-Taliban — the group that killed 145 school children just last year. The religious militancy is contributing to rising social pressure for non-Muslims, causing them to leave the country, according to Dawn. However, the reason for a surge in applications is not entirely clear.\nThe thousands of Eritreans asking for asylum in Europe are fleeing an autocratic and violent state. Eritrea's current president, Isias Afwerki, and his administration have been running the country since 1993. The country's citizens live in a constant state of fear brought on by the states' detaining and \"disappearing\" of anyone who criticizes the regime, according to the Guardian.\nA large number of those leaving Serbia are Roma — an ethnic group that has repeatedly faced discrimination in all sectors. Forceful evictions are a significant problem for Roma, leading to homelessness in some cases. Roma also face discrimination in the labor market and in schools. Roma tend to receive refugee status, unlike other applicants from the Western Balkans who are generally considered economic migrants, Zong said.\nIraq, in addition to hosting many Syrian refugees, is also seeing a flow of its own citizens away from the country. Since the U.S. invasion of 2003, instability, government inefficiency and violence has continued to plague Iraq — most recently in the form of the extremist group the Islamic State which controls large swaths of territory in Iraq and neighboring Syria.\nMany Iraqis are making the same journeys as Syrian refugees, crossing from Turkey into Greece.\nIn this photo taken Thursday, Nov. 29, 2012, a Somali internally-displaced person (IDP) child looks out from her family's makeshift home in Maslah camp on the outskirts of Mogadishu, Somalia.\nSomalis have spent decades as refugees, with third-generation Somalis now being born in refugee camps, according to UNHCR. Somalis first became refugees following the beginning of their civil war in 1991. In the years that followed, violence ensured that there was no permanent central government until 2012.\nUNHCR records indicate there's almost a million registered Somali refugees, with 420,000 of them in Kenya.\nAlbania is one of the poorest countries in Europe. While Roma also make up a part of the immigration from Albania, a majority of the applications for asylum are from ethnic Albanians, who cite a lack of economic opportunity. The problems facing the Roma in Albania are similar to what they face in Serbia. namely: eviction, lack of protection from the police, and discrimination in education according to analysis by the European Asylum Support Office."

        "text": "YouTube videos need to keep creators, users and advertisers in mind with all video projects.\nFor the longest time YouTube has called itself a video platform that gives users access to the world’s largest content library. That started changing a couple years ago when they first began collaborating with creators to make content for the platform. Since then, we’ve seen several iterations of their content strategy, from scale of funding to the nature of content, it’s been a constantly changing vision. The launch of YouTube Red and YouTube Originals in October 2015 marked a public shift of YouTube’s narrative, moving it closer to that of a media company, and we’ve been witnessing an evolution ever since. The platform’s success in its 10-plus years of existence can be summed up in its ability to reach the largest online audience with the widest range of content. From platform pioneers John and Hank Green to comedic powerhouses Rhett and Link to prolific gamer Markiplier to inclusivity advocate Hannah Hart, it isn’t an exaggeration to say that there’s something for everyone on YouTube.\nGiven their growing focus on “premium” content, more akin to TV-style productions, YouTube’s Brandcast, it’s Newfront event, has become a larger-than-life showcase of YouTube’s influence and reach. Brandcast, like most Newfronts, is designed to wow both digital and traditional brand marketers, agencies and content makers of all shapes and sizes. At Brandcast 2018, YouTube announced its plans to double down on traditional celebrity-led content from the likes of Will Smith, Priyanka Chopra, Lebron James and Kevin Hart, with just one native creator, The Slow Mo guys, on the slate. The conspicuous absence of YouTube creators in the Originals lineup was met with skepticism and concern by many creators and users in the community. It has triggered discussions across creators about YouTube’s changing focus and how it impacts them.\nToday, the highly competitive streaming arena is led by Netflix, followed by Hulu and Amazon, and YouTube is primed to become the next big player, as far as viewership goes.\nThe primary challenge with YouTube Originals is the inability to reconcile advertiser demand with user and creator interests. Reactions from users and creators across social media are reflective of this discord. YouTube’s success is built on a vibrant creator ecosystem, sharing their authentic voices with an engaged audience. This two-way street is at the core of the YouTube experience for users, creators and brands alike.\nBrands like Squarespace, Audible, Sephora and Target have collaborated with creators to make effective campaigns that feel more personal and real than traditional celebrity endorsements. These collaborations have resulted in real upticks in brand awareness, recognition and ultimately sales. With Originals, brands are assured the comfort of familiarity, but it moves away from what makes YouTube standout in a busy content ecosystem. Originals does not play to YouTube’s core strengths of organically grown communities and that unique relationship between creators and their audiences that drove users, creators and brands to YouTube in the first place."

For the little guy?\nSmall farmers hoping to carve out a living in a tough industry are increasingly relying on agritourists to pluck apples from their orchards and wander through their corn mazes — and then post the sort of just-so photographs that will draw more tourists to the country.\nPhu Mai, a marketing specialist with the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, says 287 of the state’s 7,755 farms are offering up some kind of agritourism now — hay rides, petting zoos, or cider donuts. And the payoff is pretty good: about $12 million in annual revenue. Growth is strong, too. Between 2007 and 2012, the most recent data available, Massachusetts farmers saw a 125 percent increase in agritourism.\nSauchuk Farm in Plympton has taken a healthy slice of that growth. “People love to take pictures and post to social media,” says Scott Sauchuk, who started the farm about 18 years ago. His website is filled with photos of toddlers sidling up to pumpkins and parents playing a game called “Barnyard Basketball” — that’s rows of amusement-park-style hoops made for rapid-fire shooting.\nAnd that’s just a small sampling of the kid-friendly, Instagrammable entertainment at the farm. There’s also a 100-foot-long zip line, a car in the shape of a cow, a little roller coaster, a sandbox, a slide, jumping pillows, and fruit-firing guns known as apple blasters.\nJimmy Hunt, a sixth-generation farmer at Hunt Farm, a dairy outfit in Orange, rented a GPS and spent about 25 hours cutting a corn maze to attract visitors. An aerial view, posted on his Facebook page, reveals the words “Hunt Farm, Dairy Divine, Since 1879,” built into the sprawling pattern. Hunt has also hosted an Open Farm Day for two years running, where visitors can meet the cows and sample some of their work: cheese and ice cream. In Holden, Lilac Hedge Farm held a music and beer festival last summer and sold tickets online.\nAny successful marketing campaign needs a good logo, of course. At Lilac Hedge, it’s three little lilacs set against an orange frame. At Cider Hill Farm, it’s a golden “C” and “H,” curved into the shape of an apple.\nJenny Durocher, retail marketing manager for Cider Hill, says the logo is everywhere: on labels for jams, jellies, and apparel — and sitting atop its slickly produced website, where a gauzy, high-production-value video runs on a loop.\nKids run through a maze in slow motion, weathered hands hold a pile of fresh blueberries, and brown, sugary cider donuts beckon. “Farm, Family, and Fun,” reads the text splashed over the video.

After all, many of the athletes on Santa Cruz’s roster played in enormous arenas while in college, representing heralded universities like Duke, Kentucky and Louisville.\nThat said, feeling comfortable wasn’t enough to prevent Santa Cruz from dropping its NBA G League game to Austin 105-97 in front of 15,228 enthusiastic fans.\nCook, the league’s second-leading scorer at 24.5 points per game, finished with a game-high 28 points for the Warriors (17-15), who remain in third place in the Pacific Division.\nSeven-foot center Damian Jones and guard Damion Lee each scored 15 points and two-way forward Chris Boucher scored 12 in 15 minutes off the bench.\nJaron Blossomgame had a team-high 12 boards as the Spurs outrebounded Santa Cruz 47-33, using 16 offensive rebounds for 22 second-chance points.

Curry stood up from his chair, hands on his head in disbelief, in an animated celebration after Jones’ dunk.\nGolden State coach Steve Kerr watched the game from a courtside seat.\nIn Santa Cruz’s Oracle debut last season — a 105-96 loss to the Oklahoma City Blue on Feb. 12 — the teams set a G League single-game attendance record, drawing 17,497 basketball fans.\nSanta Cruz’s tradition of playing on Golden State’s home court will continue after the NBA team’s new venue in San Francisco, the Chase Center, opens in the 2019-20 season.\nDespite the large turnouts for Santa Cruz at Oracle, Massimo Degaudenzi, Santa Cruz’s director of public and community relations, said Golden State likely won’t host more than one game each year.\n“While hosting more than one game at Oracle Arena is possible, the team is 100 percent committed to the team’s raucous and faithful fans in Santa Cruz, who have provided the best fan atmosphere in the NBA G League,” Degaudenzi stated in an email.\nSanta Cruz, which has 45 straight sellouts at Kaiser Permanente Arena, leads the league in average attendance at 2,476 fans per game. The crowd gathered at Oracle doesn’t factor into home attendance.\nThe fans, who took advantage of lower level seats priced as low as $40, a savings of hundreds of dollars over Golden State games, were excited about the change of scenery.\nScotts Valley’s Sophia Soto, 11, seated in the front row with her friends, had a big smile on her face as the game got underway.\nHarbor High golf coach Scott Bedell and his wife, Janna, were seated a section over and 10 rows back.\nSimilar to last year, there was a bobblehead giveaway to the first 10,000 fans.\nBedell, late to Oracle for last year’s game due to traffic delays created by mudslides on Highway 17, ended up missing out on the bobblehead. He later traded a vacation at his condo in Palm Springs for the souvenir, but this year was in his seat as soon as the doors opened to get his Durant bobblehead.\nDJ Andrew Rivas handled pre-game music as well as during timeouts, Golden State cheerleaders also performed and there were plenty of free T-shirt giveaways during breaks, which brought screaming fans to their feet.\nRoughly 90 percent of Santa Cruz’s season ticket holders were in attendance, Degaudenzi said. The Warriors did their best to get them as close to the floor as possible in roughly the same seat vicinity they’d have at Kaiser Permanente Arena.\n“The bobblehead’s great but I think it’s getting to see the local Santa Cruz team in great seats,” Scott Bedell said of the top reason to make the trek to Oracle.\n“I think it’s fun to see the up-and-coming players, the new talent that’s coming in,” Janna Bedell said.\n“It wouldn’t be as special if they did it more than once a year,” Scott Bedell said."

Due to lack of funding and access, a majority have yet to be reached with aid.\nIn the Beni Territory of North-Kivu, attacks by armed groups displaced more than 2,200 people from their homes in the first week of February alone. This is in addition to the 1,500 people who were displaced at the end of January. As of mid-February, more than 12,000 displaced people were sheltering in that locality.\nSome funding has come in but not nearly enough to meet the critical needs of millions in the DRC.\nIOM says their most basic needs like food and shelter are not being met because no humanitarian actors have yet to reach the areas where displaced people are arriving.\nIn the Djugu Territory, just south of North-Kivu, inter-ethnic violence between Hema and Lendu groups is flaring up, with 28,634 people fleeing burning villages and for fear of their lives to Bunia, Ituri’s provincial capital, in the last couple of weeks.\nIn the greater Kasai region, previously considered calm, intercommunal and land-related conflicts have been escalating since 2016.

Why not set a spell and listen to the piercing shriek of a creepy old lady who thinks it’s her turn to tell y’all what to do?\nHillary Clinton has started faking a Southern drawl to speak to Southerners, just as she did during her last presidential run eight years ago.\nThe tactic drew chuckles, derision and not a little resentment when she tried it in 2007 and 2008. But she was back at it again in Alabama on Saturday, putting on a heavy twang to express her contempt for Republicans.\nOf course, all politicians try to cater to whichever group they’re lying to at that particular moment. But she’s just so terrible at it. She’s a klutz. She thinks if she borrows some tricks from people who are actually good at politics, she can just bull her way through it. But she can’t. She stinks.\nWhenever Paul Ryan said something that was true, Biden laughed like a complete loon. It was bizarre and astonishing to anyone who’d been paying attention to the issues, which is why the general public bought it. Biden got away with it because — for whatever reason — people like him.\nBiden can get away with literally laughing at the truth. He commits to it, and he’s a good enough actor to pull it off. Clinton just looks like she’s lost her mind. She’s like an inexpertly constructed android trying to mimic human behavior, right down to the fake tear-wipe. She stops short of actually slapping her knee, probably due to some programming glitch.\nOf course, she’s also inept, dishonest, paranoid, lawless, and lots of other things that people tend not to like. But it’s her clumsy attempts to approximate the ways of humans that’ll really trip her up on the road to her rightful place in the Oval Office.\nUpdate: Can Any Republican Defeat Ancient Socialist Crone Hillary Clinton?"

Following the publication of Amnesty International’s briefing, Put deeds before words: Deliver human rights for Ukraine, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential administration, Anna German, said that “the promotion and unconditional protection of human rights were under the direct control of President Viktor Yanukovych”. “The statement by the presidential administration gives a positive message for the promotion of human rights in Ukraine. This must translate into a climate of greater accountability of government structures and productive dialogue with civil society”, said Nicola Duckworth, Senior Director at Amnesty International. The Amnesty International briefing contains recommendations on how to protect people in Ukraine from torture and other ill-treatment in police custody and from racial discrimination. It also advises on how to protect the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers. It was presented at a press conference in Kyiv on 14 April.The briefing recommended the establishment of an independent body to investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatment by police officers in order to combat the problem of widespread impunity for such acts. Following the press conference, the presidential administration supported the idea of creating an independent mechanism to investigate complaints against police officers and expressed support for all initiatives aimed at bringing legislation in line with international standards. During its visit to Ukraine from 13 to 14 April, an Amnesty International delegation also met with representatives of the State Committee for Nationalities and Religion, which currently has responsibility for asylum procedures, the Ministry of Justice and the General Prosecutor’s Office. Amnesty International is also recommending concrete steps to ensure that all incidents of racially motivated crimes are recorded and monitored, and that a functioning and fair asylum system is established. “President Yanukovych has declared a strong commitment to human rights but this needs to be followed by decisive action. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities on the issues that concern us,” said Nicola Duckworth."

        "text": "There’s been a lot of attention nationwide about whether our elections would be fair and accessible to everyone qualified to vote.\nIn Illinois, elections, retirements and other developments mean we’ll have a new governor and at least 40 fairly new lawmakers taking office in January. What can they and their veteran colleagues do to ensure we have fairer elections?\nOne of the singularly significant things they could do would be to follow the lead of some other states and vote to give Illinoisans a chance to approve the creation of an independent redistricting commission.\nOne of the overlooked stories of last week’s election is that voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado and Utah approved independent redistricting in their states. Earlier this year, Ohio voters approved a question requiring new maps to garner bipartisan support to be enacted.\nIn Michigan, a nonpartisan group of citizens that led an effort called “Voters not Politicians,” first collected more than 425,000 signatures to get a proposition on the ballot that was overwhelmingly approved last week. More than 61 percent of voters approved of taking away the power to draw legislative and congressional maps from state lawmakers, according to Ballotpedia. Instead, Michigan voters gave the power to a 13-member commission composed of four Republicans, four Democrats and five independents. A majority of that commission can approve the maps after the 2020 census.\nImagine this happening here: It all started with a Facebook post after the 2016 election by 29-year-old Michigan voter Katie Fahey and grew into a multimillion-dollar volunteer effort.\nThere, Republicans in the majority drew the last maps.\n“A key selling point of the proposal has been that it would take the drawing of maps out of the backrooms and in to the light of day, with ample opportunities for the public to have input through commenting on proposed district maps,” reported the Detroit Free Press.\nIn Missouri, nearly 62 percent of voters approved Amendment 1, which made changes to redistricting, lobbying laws and campaign finance limits for legislative candidates, according to Ballotpedia. Now, a nonpartisan state demographer will draw district lines guided by “partisan fairness and competitiveness.” Existing commissions for the state House and Senate already can propose changes that adhere to the fairness guideline, but those must be approved by a 70 percent vote of those commissions, according to KMOV4.\nAfter our record-setting, multimillion-dollar governor’s race and some multimillion-dollar legislative races, you might be curious about the campaign finance limits approved in Missouri. Senate candidates cannot receive more than $2,500 per person per election cycle, while House candidates cannot accept more than $2,000 per person per cycle.\nCurrently, Democrats hold the majority in the House and Republicans hold the Senate majority in Colorado.\nIn Utah, just more than 50 percent of voters approved an independent redistricting commission appointed by the governor and legislative leaders, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. A bipartisan “Better Boundaries” group argued voters should pick their politicians.\nIt seems like such a logical concept, but here, and in a majority of states, one political party or the other within the legislature draws maps, often behind closed doors, following each census. Attempts to collect voter signatures to put an independent commission on the ballot repeatedly have been rejected here by the courts. Last year, a coalition of groups tried a different approach — pushing for lawmakers to put the question on the ballot directly — but despite overwhelming support from state senators, the constitutional amendment never was called for a vote.\nAfter the 1990 census, Republicans gained control of redistricting and drew maps that favored their party and protected their interests. Democrats have had control and drawn maps to their advantage since then.\nNow, it’s a new day. Momentum is growing for fair maps. Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker long has said he favors an independent redistricting commission. We will have at least 40 new lawmakers each of us can try to influence, along with about 130 incumbents.\nWhy so many incumbents? Because in Illinois, the parties draw maps to protect them and to take away your your vote, your voice, your choice. Think about this. Last week, there were 39 Senate seats up for election, but only 18 had more than one candidate running. In the House, all 118 seats are up for election every two years, but only 64 were competitive.\nOne reason people don’t run is because they know the fix is in. The maps are rigged. The Illinois politicians are picking their voters.\nWe’ve got another chance to change that with a new governor and scores of new lawmakers. Like our neighbors in other states, let’s fight for fairer maps and elections.\nMadeleine Doubek is the Better Government Association’s vice president of policy."

        "text": "WORCESTER – Growing up in Dana Point, California, during the 1980s, Tanya L. Brown and her three sisters spent a lot of time playing on the beach and in the ocean.\nThey were popular girls, and their home was the place that friends congregated before heading home in time for their curfew - just before the street lights came on.\nBy the time Ms. Brown graduated high school and was heading to college, six of her friends had died, mostly related to drinking and driving.\n“There was no (drug) addiction like we see today. Back then, drinking and driving was a big problem,” Ms. Brown said in a telephone interview last week. She is the baby sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J. Simpson’s ex-wife, who was murdered in 1994.\nMs. Brown, an author and life coach, will be the keynote speaker at the SHINE Initiative’s 12th annual Keep Your Mind Open gala at Mechanics Hall on Thursday.\nHer sister, who was 10 years older, was murdered along with a friend, Ronald Goldman. She said the murder, which remains unsolved, turned the family’s lives upside down. But she continued to hold in the grief, though her parents were both very supportive. They taught their children to move on with life. Grief counselors for young people, she said, wasn’t something that was popular then.\nFinally, in 2004, when her fiancé canceled their wedding four days before the event, her emotional and mental health was on overload, leading to a mental breakdown.\n“It was another loss, and I went into full self-destruct mode. I was popping pills, drinking and eating everything, and I ballooned up to 200 pounds,” she recalled.\nDuring one of her emotional episodes at the family home, she blamed her parents for everything that had happened to her, as well as for Nicole’s murder. She left the room and prepared to end her life by downing 24 Klonopin pills with a glass of wine.\nOne of her sisters intervened, and her family had her admitted to a psychiatric unit at a local hospital for two weeks. There, she was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, also referred to as clinical depression. She spent another few weeks in outpatient therapy. Ms. Brown said that led her to get a graduate degree in psychology and become an advocate for education about domestic violence and mental wellness. She is the author of \"Finding Peace Amid the Chaos: My Escape From Depression and Suicide.\"\nThe first week of October each year is Mental Health Awareness Week. Also called Mental Illness Awareness Week, it was established by Congress in 1990.\nApproximately 60 million Americans will likely experience a mental disorder in their lifetime, but more than half of people living with diagnosable mental health disorders do not seek treatment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\nThe SHINE Initiative was founded by Fidelity Bank in 2004 with input from its employees to reduce the stigma of mental health conditions, end discrimination and raise awareness and understanding about mental health conditions in children, adolescents and young adults.\nThe annual gala celebrates the accomplishments of the nonprofit while raising funds to support the expansion of programs, including Student Wellness Advisory Teams that empower middle and high school students to become mental wellness advocates in their schools. The student-led teams began in 2015, and now number about 17; that is expected to increase to 40 within the next year.\nMs. Brown is among several high-profile mental health advocates who have spoken at the annual SHINE galas. Last year’s keynote speaker was Margaret Trudeau, the mother of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who discussed her experiences with bipolar disorder, including how the stigma of mental illness helped to delay her diagnosis and treatment.\nThis year’s event also celebrates the work of Paul Richard of Worcester, the outgoing executive director of the SHINE Initiative. Also, Fred Kaelin of West Boylston will be introduced as the new executive director; he began work in September and will begin his leadership Nov. 1.\nMr. Richard, 66, was director of development for Community Healthlink for more than a decade before he became executive director of the SHINE Initiative. He said the nonprofit has impacted tens of thousands of young people and adults.\n“What makes me the most proud is the direct engagement with young people throughout Central Massachusetts … their willingness and desire to talk about mental health and mental wellness in a positive uplifting way,” he said. After retirement, he said, he plans to stay involved in some form of human services.\nMr. Kaelin, 44, married father of two young boys, said his main goal is to continue the work that Mr. Richard has done to build the agency and to get into more schools throughout Central Massachusetts and Middlesex County.\nBefore being tapped for his new position, Mr. Kaelin had served as executive director of Dynamy, a residential internship program, and more recently as chief development officer of Youth Opportunities Upheld, commonly known as YOU Inc.\nThe Initiative hopes to steer people to more resources through a $57,000 Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts technology initiative to build an interactive website. The new website should be up and running in a few months, Mr. Kaelin said.\n“The more awareness that gets out there about mental health and the more people who get support earlier in life means a community will be healthier, not just the individual who gets the individual support,” he said.\nTickets to the gala, which begins at 5 p.m. Thursday at Mechanics Hall, cost $100. For tickets or information, call (978) 870-1494, or email Mr. Richard at PRichard@SHINEinitiative.org."

It was not until he walked out of the N. Lamar Blvd. store, got into his car and looked down at the cake that he saw written in blue icing, “Love Wins F**,” according to the suit.\nAfter leaving a voicemail with the corporate office that he says wasn’t returned, Jordan called the store, his lawyers say. Team Leader Geoff Nunez was immediately apologetic and promised to do everything possible to find the bakery associate responsible and correct the situation.\nAfter two hours, Jordan’s phone rang – it was Nunez calling him back to say that he didn’t think anyone at Whole Foods had acted inappropriately, Brown recalled.\nThe team member wrote “Love Wins” at the top of the cake as requested by the guest and that’s exactly how the cake was packaged and sold at the store. Our team members do not accept or design bakery orders that include language or images that are offensive. Whole Foods Market has a zero tolerance policy for discrimination."

Small flat buttons present various ugly and cryptic icons; even the more obvious ones don’t behave as you’d expect; and there’s no bundled Help file to consult, not even any obvious menus you might browse for clues.\nDon’t be tempted to give up, though. The program is quirky in the extreme, but once you’ve learned a few basic tricks then life becomes much easier.\nPress [F1], for instance, and a menu appears for the currently-selected left toolbar option. By default this offers an impressive 26 \"Drawing Modes\": Normal, Scaled, Erase, XOR, MinMax and many more. Clicking any of these displays its related options, and you can just click and drag on the screen to see its effect.\nExploring the left-hand toolbar (with the menu displayed) reveals many other interesting tools. You can \"paint\" with various clipart objects (bushes, flowers, butterflies, marbles, beads and more); apply 20 very configurable \"warp modes\" (Explode, Waves, Splash, Twirl); twist and shift colors; set various symmetrical drawing modes, and apply a host of useful filters.\nClicking the \"Image Tools\" button on the right gives access to assorted image manipulations and tweaks: flip, mirror, rotate, resize, and various automatic enhancement tools.\nBasic? Maybe, but the Plugins button and you’ll find Pixopedia supports Photoshop-compatible filter plugins (*.8BF), so there’s plenty of scope for adding more. By way of demonstration, the program comes with 20 (mostly very good) examples from providers like Richard Rosenman, Mehdi, Redfield, Flaming Pear and Dragonfly.\nAnd the feature list goes on with various selection modes, a range of shape drawing options, a configurable text tool, and what just might be the most configurable brushes we’ve ever seen in any free paint program (or most commercial ones).\nThere are plenty of frustrations here, all kinds of rules you must learn. Even functions as simple as \"Flip\" or \"Mirror\" have quirks; you can’t activate them with a click or double-click, and must instead select the tool, and click an \"Apply\" button.\nPixopedia can do so much, though, that it’s certainly worth at least some of your time. The best approach is concentrate on one part of the program, where your efforts will be quickly repaid. We would start with the image warping tools, perhaps the Photoshop plugins; they’re easy to learn, yet probably capable enough to justify installing Pixopedia, all on their own."

        "text": "When legendary media critic A.J. Liebling issued that warning some decades ago about the corrosive effect of media monopolies on the First Amendment, media ownership was a great deal more varied than it is today.\nEven then, it was far more concentrated in a few hands than when the Bill of Rights was written, when “the press” was a low-capital venture, and newspapers were easily launched by those who had something to say. The founding fathers hardly anticipated today’s media market, in which journalism is a vehicle for mega-corporate profits, and the diversity of opinion implied in the First Amendment is threatened less by a king or the state and far more by the motives of media barons.\nNowadays, media mega-mergers are the rage, and the Bush Administration is determined to remove legal barriers to media conglomeration that long have prevented a few giant corporations from controlling all of print and broadcast journalism. But can we count on the very news organizations whose owners are zealously pursuing profit from those mergers to also objectively cover the implications of media concentration for a free society?\nThe initial signs aren’t promising. When America Online purchased Time Warner in the biggest media merger in US history, there was considerable analysis of the deal’s business aspects but meager attention to implications for a representative democracy of having a significant portion of its media controlled by one corporation.\nPreviously, one could assume that Time magazine, AOL and CNN, as well as other parts of the new conglomerate, at least reflected the voices of different owners, but that’s no longer the case. Also, with that merger, AOL went from being an outsider company demanding open access to cable to being the second-largest cable operator. Suddenly it muted its open access demand, leaving the perception that the news outlets now assembled under the AOL banner might also have had a change of heart as to what’s important in the cable controversy.\nMost recently, the new Bush FCC appointees relaxed a long-standing “dual network rule” barring one television network from buying another. The result is that Viacom, which owns CBS, will have a large stake in the UPN network. Will other broadcasters anticipating similar deals permit their news organizations to voice dissenting opinions, or launch investigations of the FCC’s abandonment of its consumer watchdog role?\nMeanwhile, Rupert Murdoch has made clear his intention to purchase DirecTV from General Motors. If he succeeds, he’ll combine the largest US satellite broadcaster with his existing satellite network, which is pervasive in much of the rest of the world. Will journalists laboring in his vast empire dare raise troubling questions about the danger of one man holding such overwhelming power in the world communications market?\nFurther, Bush’s new FCC chairman, Michael Powell, promises to eliminate the 1975 prohibition against cross-ownership–a company owning a TV station and newspaper in the same market. That might prove immensely profitable to the Tribune Co., which, in purchasing the Times Mirror Co. last year, acquired newspapers in three markets where Tribune already owned television stations. But is cross-ownership healthy for independent journalism in those markets, which include New York and Los Angeles? Will the news outlets that are subsidiaries in the deal fully examine the journalistic implications of media concentration? Or will they only report on the wonders of what the owners celebrate as “convergence” or “synergy”?\nThe answer suggested by the last election is that media have difficulty covering themselves fully when the owners’ financial interests are seriously in play. How else can one explain the scant attention paid to the difference between Al Gore–who opposed cross-ownership–and George W. Bush on this issue?\nThat’s why Dingell and others believe that government regulation to preserve a diverse media market is essential. The rules concerning media ownership were not carelessly drawn up over the preceding decades to inconvenience the media industry. Rather, they were designed to save the media business from its worst instincts.\nRegulation is a reminder that there is a public interest in the news media as in no other industry because corporate concentration threatens the competition vital to an unfettered press. The free press belongs to us all and not just to the few who own one."

        "text": "During Hillary Clinton’s first presidential campaign, Neera Tanden was described as “the wonk behind Hillary.” A close associate of the Clintons, Tanden helped shape policy for both Bill and Hillary. Then she switched to playing that role for Obama.\nWhile Hillary’s email scandal broke, Tanden was in charge of the Center for American Progress, a radical left-wing group that had been described as \"Obama's Idea Factory.\" And she was chatting with John Podesta, the top Clintonite who had founded CAP. Podesta had co-chaired the Obama-Biden Transition Project. Neera Tanden would co-chair the Hillary-Kaine Transition Project under Podesta who headed up Hillary’s presidential campaign. Podesta had helped shape the last eight years of national politics through Obama and Tanden looked forward to shaping the next eight under Hillary.\nAnd what did they think of Hillary? Did they believe their defenses of her wrongdoing?\nSince the early days of the email scandal, we’ve been treated to the sordid rituals of feigned innocence. The issue was a non-issue, Clinton surrogates were quick to assure us. And even if it was, no one did anything wrong. The flies on the wall knew better though and now we can all be the flies on the wall.\nAway from the cameras and the briefings, the Clintonites held their bosses in contempt. Neera Tanden, a supposed close associate of Hillary, blasted her instincts as “suboptimal” and described her as suffering from a character problem. And there was never any doubt as to what was going on.\nTanden ridiculed Cheryl Mills for the mess. Mills fired off an email to Podesta warning that Obama’s denial wouldn’t hold up. “We need to clean this up -- he has emails from her -- they do not say state.gov,” she warned.\nObama had offered his usual denial claiming to have only learned about the scandal from the media. The revelation that Hillary had emailed Obama from her illegal address would show that he had lied. But meanwhile his people struggled to reinvent his lie by claiming that while he knew about her illegal address, he didn’t know that it was illegal. This put his lie in line with Hillary’s lie.\nThere was only one problem.\nBut that defense completely falls apart once you prove that they did know. That is what the leaked emails have begun doing. They are establishing that the Sergeant Schultz defense is utterly hollow.\nCheryl Mills knew. John Podesta knew. Barack Obama knew. And Hillary Clinton knew.\nWhen Obama told a lie that could easily be disproven while trying to distance himself from Hillary, Mills quickly fired off a warning that he had better get his story straight. And his people did. That makes Obama complicit before and after the fact. He knew what Hillary was doing when she was doing it. And his people participated in the effort to cover it up afterward, not just to protect her, but to protect him.\nHillary Clinton was not a rogue actor. She was part of an administration that had waged a war on transparency. Even media allies had dubbed it as the least transparent administration in history.\nBizarre administration email dodges included EPA boss Lisa Jackson using Richard Windsor as her alias. Jackson/Windsor left the EPA and took a seat on the board of the Clinton Foundation.\nTanden and Podesta didn’t take issue with Hillary Clinton breaking the law, but with her clumsy political instincts, her inability to fake sincere apologies and spin scandals as smoothly as Obama. Hillary’s biggest flaw in their eyes was her clumsiness at covering up acts that were routine in in Obamaworld. They didn’t despise her because she broke the law, but because she was bad at it.\nThat made her a threat to their political futures.\nHillary’s clumsy instincts led her to the point of having to admit what she did while denying having intended to do it. Motive is simultaneously the strongest and weakest defense. You can prove what someone else did, but it is hard to prove what someone else meant to do.\nUnless you have their emails.\nThis is Hillary’s firewall. It’s what every painful trickle of the scandal was meant to drag out and delay. Every partial revelation is buying time while bringing us closer to the final breach in the motive wall.\nWhat the Podesta emails tell us is that they knew. Those around Hillary knew. And those around them knew that the inner circle knew. They knew and they hated Hillary for being a bad liar. And now, as the inside drama of Clintonworld spills across the internet, the red queen moves closer to being in check.\nBy making it all about motive, Hillary Clinton turned personal communications, particularly emails, into the key instrument of culpability. That is why Podesta’s emails are such a hot commodity. It’s why her emails are becoming an even bigger prize.\nNeera Tanden was right. Hillary Clinton’s political instincts are suboptimal. She is the member of the Obama graduating class voted least likely to be able to lie convincingly on national television. And she has a perverse knack for dragging everyone around her into her scandals while exposing their own.\nWe know that her people knew that she lied. We know that Obama lied. All that’s left is her final lie."

He's the public face of Content Marketing Institute, the upstart digital marketing company that brought more than 1,750 people from as far away as Australia and Thailand to the Cleveland Convention Center this week.\nPulizzi said his conference, which drew attendees from 40 nations, is the largest content marketing event on the planet. \"And the best part? Seventy-five percent of them had never been to Cleveland before,\" he said.\nCMWorld founder Joe Pulizzi always wears something orange.\n\"Cleveland's the center of the content industry,\" he said, shrugging. \"I started using that term in 2001 before it became hip.\" He calls himself the \"Godfather of Content Marketing.\"\nPositively Cleveland, the region's convention and visitors bureau, estimates the economic impact from CMWorld at $3.9 million over the four-day conference.\nThat includes nearly 2,500 room nights at seven hotels, dining out at local restaurants, and other spending, but not the conference registration costs of up to $2,495 per person.\nContent Marketing Institute is ranked 468 on Inc. magazine's list of America's 5,000 fastest-growing private companies for its 989 percent growth over the past three years. It reported revenues of $3.1 million in 2012. Its 14-member staff, all of whom work from home, balloons to 34 during CMWorld.\nDressed in his signature orange shirt, shoes and pocket square, Pulizzi presides over the convention like a celebrity, and even carries around a fine-point orange Sharpie to sign autographs.\nMany of those who approach him do so toting copies of his latest book, \"Epic Content Marketing: How to Tell a Different Story, Break Through the Clutter and Win More Customers by Marketing Less.\"\nOf the attendees, \"10 percent of the people have the word'content' in their titles. The others are marketing directors, social media directors, or people who in some way, shape or form are responsible for content,\" he said.\nThey're the kind of people who, when actor William Shatner took the CMWorld stage on Wednesday night, they sent out more than 1,212 tweets an hour about it.\nSo what exactly is content marketing?\nVijay Palaparty, a 1998 graduate of Westlake High School who now works as director of communications and finance writer for NACHA, the Electronic Payments Association in Herndon, Va., was a first-time attendee.\n\"We all have stories to tell, we all have content. But how do you use that in effective ways to connect with the right people?\" he asked.\nKate Eidam, a business lead at Akhia Public Relations in Hudson, put it this way: \"Consumers are accustomed to ignoring advertising. It's often just background noise. At the same time, they demand more from brands in terms of relevant information, transparency and responsiveness.\"\n\"This leaves a gap, which is, in turn, an opportunity for marketers to reach customers with authentic, relevant, helpful and engaging information and conversations,\" she said. \"Content marketing is at the core of filling this gap, as well as helping brands increase revenue, conversion and awareness.\"\n\"It's the best conference I've been to in years,\" she added. \"The idea-gathering, creation, curation and exchange has been unprecedented. It's one of those conferences you leave feeling re-energized and more excited than ever about the work you do every day.\"\n\"Who knew Cleveland was so nice?\"\nThe third annual Content Marketing World conference drew more then 1,750 people to the Cleveland Convention Center, 75 percent of whom were first-time visitors, according to organizers.\nThis is exactly the kind of tech-savvy crowd Pulizzi envisioned when he and his employees hosted the first Content Marketing World gathering here in 2011.\nThey reserved a room at the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel hoping 100 to 150 people might show up. \"We ended up getting 660, and took over the Renaissance,\" Pulizzi said.\nThe next year, they were forced to move the conference to Columbus. \"As a Cleveland guy, I wanted it in Cleveland, but there was no venue that could hold us,\" he said. \"It was kind of depressing when you think about it, for a city of our size.\"\nSo when the $465 million Cleveland Convention Center announced it was opening last month, CMWorld was among the first to jump aboard.\n\"What we're hearing from attendees is'It's so clean!\"Who knew Cleveland was this nice?\"There's so much history here\"It's so easy to get around'\" Pulizzi said. \"Of course, we only showed them the good stuff,\" he joked.\nCMWorld is the second-largest event of visitors, after the 2013 National Senior Games, that the Convention Center has hosted so far, said Dave Johnson, director of public relations for the Convention Center and the Global Center for Health Innovation.\n\"This is a significant event because it illustrates the direct economic impact a convention center can have on a city,\" by bringing back a conference it wouldn't have been able to attract before, Johnson said. \"Any time you bring people in from outside the seven-county region, they're spending money and leaving their money behind.\"\nIt also stretched the convention center's capacity to provide audiovisual, WiFi, food and beverage, custodial and other services required for a group of its size, he said. The fact that there were no major hiccups bodes well for future gatherings.\n\"As of today, there are 155 events scheduled here through the end of calendar year 2014, with 213,000 attendees and 89,000 group hotel room nights,\" Johnson said.\nJoe Pulizzi walks around the Content Marketing World like a celebrity, and even carries a fine-point orange Sharpie around with him to sign autographs.\nAmong them is the 2014 Content Marketing World conference, from Sept. 8-10.\nPulizzi said his group is only a small piece of what could be a much bigger comeback for Cleveland. \"We have so many amazing corporations, and all of them have events: Lincoln Electric, Sherwin-Williams, Eaton, the law firms.\n\"Why are they not bringing their events here?\" he asked. \"That's what I'd like to know.\""

But the truth is much more complicated, said Allison Daley, the study's co-author and a Burlington, Ont.,-native working on her PhD at Sweden's Uppsala University.\n\"Back when he found them, he thought they were all separate animals and gave them separate names,\" said Daley.\n\"It was only when my co-author, Desmond Collins, did collecting in the'80s and'90s that he discovered that all these different parts.... were actually different parts of just one animal, the hurdia animal.\"\nOnce Collins and Jean-Bernard Caron — both of the Royal Ontario Museum and the other Canadian co-authors of the study — started assembling these pieces, it became clear that they were looking at a creature unlike anything they had ever seen.\nIt has a pair of tiny claws on its head that likely were used to shovel food into its large and toothy mouth, similar to another group of predators from that time, of the genus A nomalocaris.\nBut its most distinct feature is the shell, or carapace, jutting from the front of its head. While crustaceans often have shells to protect the soft parts of the body, the H urdia shell is empty.\n\"It's very odd,\" Caron told CBC News. \"We don't understand the connection of this part to the rest of the creature very well.\"\nCaron said the carapace likely slowed the creature down, leading it to probably spend most of its time feeding closer to the sea floor.\nAlso contributing to the study were Graham Budd of Uppsala University and Gregory Edgecombe of the Natural History Museum in Britain.\nThe Burgess Shale, located high in the Rocky Mountains, has provided paleontologists with a treasure trove of fossils from about 505 million years ago. It was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981."

Merchants also weren’t asking customers if they qualify for a discount at the point of sale.\nLarky’s app gives users a consolidated view of all their memberships and, using GPS coordinates, sends a push notification to users’ phones when they’re near a member discount. The app functions as a mobile wallet for discount cards, and Bank says it’s “silly simple” to sign up—users indicate which organizations they belong to on a checklist. No membership numbers are required, he adds. According to Blank, the average Larky user has seven memberships and can save up to $1,000 per year using Larky.\nOn Wednesday, Larky announced a new partnership with the health insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan in an effort to increase BCBSM members’ participation in the Healthy Blue Xtras program, which offers discounts from Michigan merchants centered around a healthy lifestyle. Bank and his wife have been BCBSM members for about 10 years, he says, and yet they had no idea the program existed. Once they discovered it, Bank says he contacted Blue Cross to offer Larky’s services, and the two entities teamed up for a yearlong project to promote Larky’s services and get members signed up to Healthy Blue Xtras.\nSo far, Bank says Larky has “not quite 50,000” users, though he expects to see that number rise, thanks to the new partnership with BCBS, which has 4 million total members—500,000 of whom have opted in to receive e-mails about Healthy Blue Xtras.\nAs Larky continues its efforts to spread the word about its services, it has received praise from Good Housekeeping and Lifehacker. Bank says the company, which raised a $400,000 seed round from North Coast Technology Investors and the First Step Fund in the spring, is still in fundraising mode and expects to close a $2 million round in the next 60 days from investors in the Midwest, New York, and Silicon Valley.\nThough Larky’s app—available on iOS and coming soon for Android—is free for users, membership organizations pay to be included. So far, Bank says, the feedback from them has been good. After all, he points out, what’s the point of offering member discounts as a value-add if nobody is using them?"

        "text": "The first vote by a Senate committee is due over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court.\nIt follows Thursday's testimony by Mr Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault.\nDr Ford, close to tears, described the alleged 1982 attack in detail, saying it had \"drastically\" affected her life. Judge Kavanaugh angrily denied he had assaulted her or anyone.\nPresident Donald Trump has urged the full Senate to approve his nominee.\nThat vote is expected next week. Republicans currently have a majority of 51-49 in the Senate, but a number of senators on both sides are said to be undecided.\nJudge Kavanaugh's appointment would tilt the balance in favour of conservatives for years to come.\nFor this reason, Republicans accuse the Democrats of seeking to delay the confirmation until after the mid-term elections in November when they hope to win enough seats to stop it altogether. Democrats counter by accusing Republicans of trying to \"railroad\" the process.\nThe Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life - appointed for life, its nine members have the final say on US law.\nThis includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy.\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who was believed to be wavering, issued a statement shortly before the committee began sitting on Friday morning stating that he would back Judge Kavanaugh.\nOn his way to the committee room following the release of the statement, he was berated by two women who said they were victims of sexual violence and urged him to change his mind.\nAs the committee began, the bitter political divide was clear as an attempt by Democrats to call a further witness - Mark Judge, who Dr Ford said was present during the alleged sexual assault - was defeated by the 11 Republicans voting against the 10 Democrats.\nA subsequent motion to move to a vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination was passed despite vocal Democratic objections. Some Democratic senators refused to vote on that and walked out of the hearing.\nIn a letter after Thursday's hearing, Robert Carlson, head of the American Bar Association - the body representing US lawyers and students of law - urged a delay of the vote to enable the FBI to check the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.\nThe association had previously supported Judge Kavanaugh for the role.\nWhat did Christine Blasey Ford say?\nThursday's hearing, which lasted for nine hours, brought an outpouring of support for Dr Ford - a university professor - from the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault.\nPrior to Thursday, no-one had heard from the 51-year-old publicly since the allegations arose.\n\"I am here today not because I want to be,\" Dr Ford said. \"I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\"\nShe alleged he and his friend Mark Judge had locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in a Washington DC suburb in the summer of 1982, when she was 15 and Judge Kavanaugh was 17.\nDr Ford said Brett Kavanaugh had tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her. Both men were \"drunkenly laughing\", she said.\nShe added: \"Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details.\"\nUnder questioning by a Democratic senator, she said her most vivid memory was \"the laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense.... They were laughing with each other - two friends having a really good time with one another\".\nIn an answer to a question from another Democrat about claims of mistaken identity, Dr Ford said she was \"100%\" certain that Judge Kavanaugh had assaulted her.\nHow did Brett Kavanaugh respond?\nThe 53-year-old federal judge took a combative approach but occasionally became emotional.\n\"This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,\" he told the committee.\n\"The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.\n\"Since my nomination in July there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation.\"\nHe insisted he would not be \"intimidated\" into withdrawing from the process.\n\"You may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit. Never.\"\nJudge Kavanaugh said he did not doubt that Prof Ford had been assaulted, but insisted: \"I've never sexually assaulted Dr Ford - or anyone.\"\nHe admitted he had drunk beer while at high school, but said he had never got so drunk as to forget events.\nHe added that his calendars for 1982 - which he had kept - showed he had not attended a party at the location Prof Ford had described.\nThe Democratic senators on the committee have called on President Trump to \"immediately withdraw\" Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.\nMoments after the hearing ended, however, President Trump tweeted that he was standing by his nominee and said he found Judge Kavanaugh's testimony \"powerful, honest and riveting\".\nMr Trump has repeatedly defended the judge's character, saying he is \"one of the highest quality people\" he has ever met.\nThousands of protesters against the nomination took to the streets on Thursday and 59 people were arrested near the Supreme Court in Washington, DC.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation could result in a recommendation that the candidate should be confirmed or rejected, or in no recommendation at all.\nAfter Friday's panel vote, the full Senate could start taking procedural votes at the weekend.\nA final vote by the full chamber could come as soon as Tuesday.\nA simple majority of those present is needed for the confirmation. If there is a tie, the vice-president, who presides over the Senate, casts the deciding vote.\nJudge Kavanaugh denies these allegations, and on Thursday called Ms Swetnick's allegation \"a joke\" and \"a farce\".\nThe US Supreme Court: Who are the justices?"

        "text": "It's a hot-rod sedan. It's also a big deal for Infiniti's global ambitions.\nNissan's (NASDAQOTH:NSANY) luxury brand Infiniti this week gave the world more details about its intriguing Q50 Eau Rouge, a concept version of a high-performance luxury sedan.\nAnd those details got the world's attention.\nInfiniti had shown off the outside of the Eau Rouge in Detroit in January. But at the Geneva International Motor Show this past week, things got really interesting when the company unveiled the Eau Rouge's engine, one that came straight out of Nissan's GT-R supercar: a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V6 making a whopping 560 horsepower.\nThat's big-league power. That's comparable to Cadillac's mighty CTS-V and BMW's (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) all-conquering M5, two of the fastest sedans ever built -- and it makes a serious statement about where Nissan is taking its luxury brand. Just as General Motors (NYSE:GM) is making a big push to turn Cadillac into a global luxury brand, Nissan is doing much the same with Infiniti.\nAnd as Fool contributor John Rosevear explains in this video, a decision to build the Eau Rouge with that tremendous V6 would instantly bring a lot of car-enthusiast credibility to Infiniti's efforts, and it could end up serving as a much-needed flagship for the brand.\nJohn Rosevear: Hey Fools, it's John Rosevear. When we talk about automakers and profits these days, we often talk about luxury cars. Globally speaking, luxury cars are a fast-growing business, in part because of a boom in demand in China, and since they tend to be higher-profit products than mainstream vehicles, we've seen several automakers push to expand their luxury offerings.\nThe most visible one for us here in the U.S. has probably been Cadillac, GM has made huge strides in its effort to put Cadillac on the level of BMW and Mercedes, but there's a similar effort under way at Nissan. Nissan is spending big bucks to turn its Infiniti brand, which was originally launched as kind of a me-too imitation of Toyota's (NYSE:TM) Lexus for the U.S. market, they want to turn Infiniti into a global luxury-vehicle powerhouse. Infiniti has a slew of new models under development, and Nissan has big plans to greatly expand the brand's presence in China and Europe, right in BMW's backyard.\nTheir latest move was revealed this past week at the Geneva International Motor Show, it's the Infiniti Q50 Eau Rouge sedan. Now \"Eau Rouge\" means \"red water\" in French, that may not mean anything to you, but it's the name of one of the most famous corners on one of the world's most famous racetracks, the Spa racecourse in Belgium, very famous and important Formula 1 track. So this is a name that connotes serious high performance with a European accent.\nNow the Q50 Eau Rouge wasn't actually unveiled this week, we saw this car at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January, and it looked pretty good but Infiniti didn't tell us all that much about it at the time so we didn't pay all that much attention. The big news in Geneva is that they revealed the Eau Rouge's engine, and it's a doozy.\nIt's a twin-turbo version of Nissan's excellent V6, 3.8 liters, and it's got 560 horsepower. That's a lot. That's BMW M5 and Cadillac CTS-V territory, and these are among the fastest sedans ever built. So Infiniti is making a big statement here. They say the Eau Rouge will be all wheel drive, it'll have a 7 speed gearbox, and it'll go zero to sixty in under 4 seconds and top out at around 180 miles per hour.\nFor a luxury sports sedan, that's the big leagues.\nNow, assuming they build this thing, it's not going to sell in big numbers, it's not going to add billions to Nissan's global bottom line. But it's still really important. Just as BMW's M cars, the M3 and M5 and so forth, they pack extreme performance at a high price, and BMW doesn't sell all that many, but the fact that they exist makes the rest of the BMW line seem that much more desirable.\nThese are halo cars, they're an important part of the image of the overall BMW brand. Cadillac caught on to this a while ago. When they released the second-generation CTS-V in late 2008, it was the fastest production four-door car in the world, they could back that up, and it was a great product for the time, auto critics drove it and raved about it, and this was all at a moment when GM was going down the tubes, but it really was key to putting Cadillac on the map of people who weren't accustomed to looking past the German luxury brands.\nClearly that's what Infiniti wants to do with the Eau Rouge. Officially it's just a concept car right now, we don't know if they're going to build it, when they'll build it, or what it'll cost, but it seems clear that the Infiniti brand could really benefit from a car like this in terms of raising awareness with car enthusiasts around the world, and I think it's a matter of \"when\", not \"if\". Thanks for watching, and Fool on."

In 2015, Russian-linked companies paid Flynn more than US$65,000, including about US$45,000 from the state-backed Russian television network RT for a December trip to Moscow, where he delivered a speech and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner.\nIn December, a US wiretap of the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, intercepted conversations he had with Flynn discussing the Obama administration's imposition of sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election.\nThe other set stems from Turkey. Last year, Flynn's lobbying firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid more than US$500,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch corporation. Inovo is owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-American businessman with ties to the administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.\nThe work centred on research to discredit Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, and whose extradition Erdogan has been seeking.\nRobert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. But in a letter to the Senate this week, Kelner and other lawyers portrayed Flynn as being treated unfairly, saying he was \"the target on nearly a daily basis of outrageous allegations.\"\nHere is a breakdown of some of the possible legal problems for Flynn.\nInvestigators are scrutinising whether several of Flynn's statements violated a statute that makes it a felony, punishable by five years in prison, to make a false statement to the government. To convict, prosecutors must prove that the violation was knowing and willful, not merely inadvertent.\nIn January 2016, Flynn, a former three-star general who retired in 2014 after being forced out as head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, applied to have his security clearance extended. As part of the process, he filled out and signed a SF-86 form. It directed him to disclose his foreign travel, compensation and contacts.\nIt also referred to the false-statement statute as part of a certification that the information was truthful and complete.\nAfter viewing the form, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said Flynn had concealed his Russia trip and the compensation when he filled it out.\nIn February 2016, investigators reviewing Flynn's application to renew his security clearance interviewed him. According to a letter this month from Cummings, documents suggest Flynn falsely stated in that interview that US companies had funded his Moscow visit and that he had only \"insubstantial contact\" with foreigners, despite the dinner with Putin.\nFlynn's legal team has said he briefed the Defence Intelligence Agency about the trip. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, also failed to mention encounters with Russian officials on their SF-86 forms.\nSeparately, four days into the Trump administration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak in December. Several news outlets have reported that he initially told the FBI that he had not discussed sanctions on Russia but then backtracked and said he could not remember.\nThe Constitution's emoluments clause prohibits people who hold government positions from receiving payments from foreign governments without prior consent from Congress. This rule extends to retired military personnel, and Congress enacted a statute to carry it out. It says retired military personnel may accept such compensation only if they get permission from their service secretary and the secretary of state.\nFlynn apparently did not obtain permission before taking compensation from RT or Inovo. That failure is complicated by the fact that they are companies, not governments, but the US government has portrayed RT as an arm of the Kremlin.\nAlptekin has told reporters he hired Flynn with his own funds and did not coordinate with the Turkish government. But congressional investigators have expressed skepticism after receiving classified briefings.\n\"As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else,\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said in April.\n\"And it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate, and there are repercussions for the violation of law.\"\nSuch a violation would not constitute a criminal offence; a Pentagon ethics document says the penalty is forfeiting the funds through withheld retirement pay, not prison time. The acting inspector general of the Defence Department, Glenn Fine, told Congress that his office had begun investigating whether Flynn violated emoluments rules.\nThe Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, requires that people representing foreign governments or political parties register with the Justice Department within 10 days. Under departmental regulations, this rule extends to lobbyists hired by foreign companies if the \"principal beneficiary\" of their work is a foreign government.\nIn September, after signing the contract with Inovo, the Flynn Intel Group registered as an ordinary lobbyist for that firm but did not make a FARA filing, which requires greater disclosure.\nHowever, in March, after his ouster from the Trump administration, Flynn's lawyers filed a belated FARA registration about the arrangement \"to eliminate any potential doubt.\"\n\"Because of the subject matter of Flynn Intel Group's work for Inovo BV, which focused on Mr Fethullah Gulen, whose extradition is sought by the government of Turkey, the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,\" the lawyers wrote.\nViolating FARA is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, although legal specialists say the Justice Department rarely prosecutes that charge.\nSeveral congressional committees have been seeking information about Flynn's activities, and there are signs more subpoenas are coming. The Senate Intelligence Committee voted unanimously Thursday to give its top Republican and Democrat broad authority to issue subpoenas.\nThe most advanced subpoena is one the Intelligence Committee issued to Flynn on May 10 seeking all records of his meetings and communications with Russian officials, and of his communications with Trump's campaign about Russia in the 18 months before Trump's inauguration.\nOn Monday, Flynn's lawyers told the committee that he was invoking his right against self-incrimination to avoid complying with the subpoena. Although invoking the Fifth Amendment is usually associated with live testimony, his lawyers argued that it fell under a precedent for document production requests that are so broad that the act of acknowledging whether any such files exist could amount to self-incriminating testimony.\nThe committee can vote to hold anyone refusing to comply with a subpoena in contempt of Congress. If the full House or Senate chamber votes likewise, the dispute moves into court.\nThe Justice Department would have to decide whether to prosecute the subpoena recipient for criminal contempt of Congress, which carries a penalty of one to 12 months in prison. Lawmakers could also file a lawsuit asking a federal judge to order compliance with their subpoena."

        "text": "“We invent these days because we need it, because we aren’t being seen, we aren’t being acknowledged. So we take the power back and we acknowledge ourselves and each other,” Tessa Thompson told BuzzFeed News.\nFrom left: Honorees Tessa Thompson, Lena Waithe, Tiffany Haddish, and Danai Gurira onstage during the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon in Beverly Hills.\nIf you, like Issa Rae, were rooting for everyone black this awards season, you only got to celebrate a few moments. At Sunday’s 90th Academy Awards, there was Jordan Peele’s Best Original Screenplay win for Get Out and Kobe Bryant’s Best Short Film (Animated) win for Dear Basketball. (And even that win for Bryant had a problematic shadow cast over it due to the former NBA player’s past.) Earlier this year at the Golden Globes, Sterling K. Brown won for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series. And at the Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards, Oprah Winfrey and Morgan Freeman were given honorary awards respectively. But that’s about it.\nAt the Oscars, some of the nominees included Denzel Washington and Daniel Kaluuya for Best Actor, and Octavia Spencer and Mary J. Blige, both for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Granted, this was an especially unpredictable year but none of the aforementioned actors prevailed with a golden statue. While Peele made history for winning Best Original Screenplay, he did not win in the coveted Best Director category in which only four black men have been nominated in 90 years — none of whom have won. Mudbound director Dee Rees joined the list of black female directors who didn’t even get nominated in the category despite having her film recognized for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Supporting Actress (Blige). Tiffany Haddish was overlooked altogether for her hilarious comedic performance in Girls Trip, unlike Melissa McCarthy for her role in Bridesmaids, widely categorized as Girls Trip’s white-counterpart film. And finally, one of 2017’s most successful films, Get Out, failed to win for Best Picture — and this time the envelope was read correctly.\nBut #OscarsSoWhite isn’t anything new, and Black Hollywood no longer waits for their recognition at mainstream award shows. In fact, almost everyone who deserved to be honored for their work this year was celebrated in the week leading up to the Oscars — it just didn’t happen at ceremonies that air live on network television. Instead, it happened in “rooms of requirement” created for us, by us: At annual pre-Oscar awards ceremonies like the American Black Film Festival Honors (ABFF) and Essence’s Black Women in Hollywood Luncheon; intimate dinners like Common’s Toast to the Arts and Alfre Woodard’s Sistahs Soiree; and black excellence parties like the one Jay-Z and Beyoncé threw this year that shook up the post-Oscar party scene that used to have a clear hierarchy. Each of these events look like a powerful sea of melanin, and leave a current so strong every glimpse can’t help but go viral.\nLeft: Dave Chappelle, Jordan Peele, Jay-Z, Kobe Bryant, and Anthony Anderson. Right: Tiffany Haddish, Danai Gurira, Marcus Henderson, Jay-Z, Winston Duke, and Lupita Nyong'o at Jay-Z and Beyoncé's Oscars afterparty.\nThompson was honored at the magazine’s 11th annual luncheon, created to honor black women both in front of and behind the camera in Hollywood. The ceremony, which airs on Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network (notice a trend?), also honored Black Panther’s Danai Gurira, Girls Trip’s Haddish, and Master of None star and creator of The Chi, Lena Waithe, this year. Held at the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Los Angeles, the event can best be described as a huge black girl magic brunch where all of your Black Hollywood faves (and I do mean all) come together to uplift, celebrate, and fellowship with one another. Many of the women in attendance that day echoed Thompson’s feelings and noted that the luncheon is their favorite awards season event, even more than the Academy Awards itself.\nClockwise from left: Susan Kelechi Watson, Yvette Nicole Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Honoree Lena Waithe, Honoree Tessa Thompson, Sonequa Martin-Green, Edwina Findley Dickerson, and Honoree Danai Gurira attend the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon in Beverly Hills.\nThat subtle change in how Waithe framed her speech demonstrates the difference between these events and the traditional awards season ceremonies. There’s a level of comfort present in the former, a common bond formed through the struggle of being black in Hollywood, and in the case of Essence’s luncheon specifically, a sisterhood that’s formed when a win for one is a win for all.\nHonoree Danai Gurira (left) and Lupita Nyong'o onstage during the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon.\n“It’s important for us to remember who we are, and when we look into the eyes of those like us, we remember who we are, we get renewed, we get inspired, we get rejuvenated, we get revived,” Gurira told BuzzFeed News. The Black Panther star went on to explain how many of the women in attendance have broken down barriers and opened doors for future generations of black women in Hollywood to move through. Gurira herself was in the room five years ago watching Oprah Winfrey, Alfre Woodard, Gabrielle Union, Mara Brock-Akil, Naomie Harris, and Quvenzhané Wallis be honored. Since then her star has risen with a hit show (The Walking Dead), No. 1 movie (Black Panther), and a play under her belt (Eclipse). So as she stood onstage accepting her award, presented by another former honoree, Lupita Nyong’o, the newer actors in the room saw that upward mobility in Hollywood is possible for black actors, and that they are not alone in the obstacles they face while trying to achieve it.\nLil Rel Howery (left) and Daniel Kaluuya during the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon.\nThe ABFF Honors were held exactly one week before the Oscars, honoring Ava DuVernay, Omari Hardwick, Tiffany Haddish, Billy Dee Williams, and the cast of Martin while also awarding Black-ish, Insecure, Get Out, and Queen Sugar in various traditional categories. It was the only event during awards season where you could see Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell-Martin mend their rift onstage, or Issa Rae joke about being too drunk to give a proper acceptance speech, or hear about how Omari Hardwick paid for the craft services while they filmed Middle of Nowhere together because DuVernay couldn’t afford it.\nClockwise from left: American Black Film Festival Founder & CEO Jeff Friday, Nicole Friday, Omari Hardwick, Tiffany Haddish, and Billy Dee Williams at the 2018 American Black Film Festival Honors Awards in Beverly Hills, California.\nCommon took his support a step further by creating his own platform to do so, through his Toast to the Arts dinner held in West Hollywood the Friday before the Oscars. There, he honored Rees, Blige, and Charles D. King for Mudbound and filmmaker Charles Burnett.\nCommon and Mary J. Blige attend Toast to the Arts Presented By Remy Martin at Ysabel in West Hollywood, California.\nTiffany Haddish (left) and Yvonne Orji attend the 2018 Essence Black Women in Hollywood Oscars Luncheon in Beverly Hills.\nAt one point or another, these FUBU awards ceremonies rooted for everyone black: They recognized the impact black actors, directors, and producers have had in the industry and honored them accordingly; not just with nominations but with actual awards that allowed them a platform to give inspiring speeches and a trophy to take home (or more likely, give to their mama). And they give black actors a place to convene and be in the room since many are often not even invited to awards season’s darling ceremonies, as Gabrielle Union pointed out at the Golden Globes in January when she revealed that was the first time she received an invitation to attend. And when you’re constantly snubbed a seat at the table, it’s only a matter of time before you create your own damn table. That’s what these events are: a space for black artists to be fed both literally and figuratively before they’ve even stepped foot on red carpets; to know that their work mattered whether or not it was recognized by the Academy, the Hollywood Foreign Press, or the rest of the Screen Actors Guild."

ESA scientists will unveil the target landing site on Sept. 15, 2014. Philae will make its historic landing on the comet on Nov. 11, if all goes well.\nThe target drop zone for a historic landing on a comet in deep space by a European spacecraft will be unveiled this month after weeks of scrutiny to scout out the perfect location.\nScientists with the European Space Agency will reveal the comet landing site target for Philae, a lander riding aboard the agency's Rosetta spacecraft, on Sept. 15. If all goes well, the Philae lander will touch down on its target, the Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, on Nov. 11.\nRosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition. The comet has two distinct sides to it, and a shape that reminds some investigators of a rubber duck.\nIn late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions.\nPhilae will remain at work on the surface for at least a few weeks, harpooned in place to prevent it from easily leaving the 2.5-mile-long (4 kilometer) comet's low gravity. Rosetta itself is expected to transmit data through at least August 2015, when the comet makes its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars.\nThe European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles (6 billion km) to reach the comet.\nOne major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets — considered one of the building blocks of the solar system — are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun.\nPredicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult because their composition is so variable, making it hard to figure out how much gas and dust will stream away when the sun warms the comet's surface."

        "text": "In the past few weeks, senators have been so focused on squabbling over the nomination of Chuck Hagel as secretary of Defense that it seemed like John Brennan would have a relatively easy time being confirmed as director of the CIA. However, following NBC News’s release yesterday of a Justice Department white paper that outlines the administration’s legal justification for conducting drone strikes against Americans suspected of terrorism, Brennan’s nomination is quickly morphing into a showdown over the Obama administration’s drone policy. Now the New York Times has added more fuel to the controversy, revealing that the United States has a secret CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia that’s used to conduct strikes in neighboring Yemen.\nThe Saudi base, which was constructed two years ago, was first used to launch the drones that killed American-born Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki. Though much of the debate has focused on the targeting of U.S. citizens, only four Americans have been killed in U.S. airstrikes in Yemen since 2002. By comparison, at least 24 people have already been killed by U.S. drones in Yemen this year, and since the campaign started more than 3,000 militants and civilians have been killed in strikes in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.\nAs the the White House’s chief counterterrorism adviser, Brennan is the main coordinator of the terrorist “kill list” and oversees the drone strikes conducted by both the military and the CIA. Brennan was previously the CIA’s station chief in Saudi Arabia, and urged the Obama administration to take the threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network’s Yemen affiliate, more seriously.\nInterestingly, some journalists have known about the “secret” Saudi base for some time. The Washington Post says it didn’t disclose the location at the administration’s request, but it “learned Tuesday night that another news organization was planning to reveal the location of the base, effectively ending an informal arrangement among several news organizations that had been aware of the location for more than a year.” The Post reports that it’s just one of a “growing constellation of drone bases” operated by the U.S. overseas.\nFor years, critics of the drone campaign have been calling on Obama to make good on his pledge to have the “most transparent administration in history,” and with Brennan’s nomination, now they feel they finally have a bit of leverage. As Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Intelligence Committee, told the Post, “If the Congress doesn’t get answers to these questions now, it’s going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get them in the future.” It sounds like Brennan’s Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday is going to get ugly."

Only half had enrolled and most had not completed the training.\nComputer use among those who had been on the courses had increased - but rarely their teaching expertise.\n\"The need for teachers to use their own time for training, together with the lack of information about the range of training programmes from which to choose, has hindered progress,\" said Ofsted's report.\nIn response, the Teacher Training Agency said training had been provided or arranged for three quarters of 415,000 eligible teachers and librarians in England and the rest had until March next year to sign up.\nThe Department for Education said take-up of computer training by teachers had been \"unprecedented\", with more than 250,000 now having started a course.\nIt had been decided that they should attend outside school hours so as to cause the minimum disruption to pupils, a spokeswoman said.\nIn a commentary on their findings, the inspectors said there had been a flexibility in the approach to getting ICT into schools - but this had led to a fragmentation of effort, \"with training organisations, LEAs and schools independently seeking solutions to the same problems\".\nThis was \"in stark contrast\" with the more uniform approach of the national literacy and numeracy strategies, they said.\nFunding had also varied widely between schools.\nLong-term planning was also a concern, as regards linking curriculum developments to staff competence and replacing out-of-date equipment.\nOfsted's chief inspector, Mike Tomlinson, said: \"As can be seen, there are messages for all who have responsibilities for ICT, at any level, if the initiative is to have maximum impact on standards of work.\""

Investors should not worry about the somewhat strange ticker symbol for the Makita shares trading as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR); the stock provides solid, if cyclical value.\nMakita is best known for its hand power tools, and those tools generated more than 70 percent of the company's sales. The balance of sales is split between garden and household power products and replacement parts sales. Europe is Makita's biggest market, with 42.5 percent of sales in the latest fiscal year. Japan provided 17 percent of sales and North America accounted for just 13.6 percent. The rest of Asia, South America, Africa, and the Middle East produced the remaining 27 percent. Makita is truly a global company, headquartered in Japan.\nThe company's results were affected by the economic slowdown and reduction in construction activity. Total revenues declined for the fiscal years of 2009 and 2010 before rebounding in fiscal year 2011, which ended in March. Annual revenues increased by 11 percent over the previous year and net income per share grew by 34 percent.\nThe first quarter of Makita's fiscal 2012 saw revenues increase by 17 percent and net income per share jumped by 56 percent. A portion of the strong growth numbers is due to the effects of the earthquake and tsunami which hit Japan in the spring. The company has forecast second quarter revenue and income growth in a 12 percent to 15 percent range.\nMakita is not followed by Wall Street and just 3 percent of the company shares are held by U.S. institutional investors. However, the stock has produced significantly better historical performance than rival Black & Decker.\nAt the time this article was written, MKTAY was up 14 percent from the previous year and SWK was down by the same amount. Over a three year period Makita had outperformed its rival 60 percent to 6 percent. Past results do not predict the future, but that performance is something to think about.\nThe company reports next on Oct. 31."

His novels include the Edgar Award-winning La Brava, Out of Sight and numerous stories turned into big screen movies Get Shorty and Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown.\nThe latter tale, adapted from Leonard's Rum Punch, appeared perfect for Tarantino in his post-Pulp Fiction era, and he cleverly cast Pam Grier - the star of Coffy and Foxy Brown - in the lead role.\nIt's supporting cast including Robert De Niro, Samuel L Jackson, Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton, though Grier and Robert Foster were the real treats. Jackie Brown revitalized both actors' careers, with the former landing a Golden Globe nomination and the latter scoring an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\nAfter the success of Pulp Fiction, Tarantino and his long-time producer Roger Avary - presumably armed with a little more cash - acquired the film rights to Leonard's novels Rum Punch, Freaky Deaky and Killshot.\nThe director originally set about adapting one of the latter two, leaving Rum Punch to another director, though he was said to have fallen in love with the novel and penned the screenplay, renaming it Jackie Brown.\nTarantino changed the ethnicity of the main character from white to black, renaming her Brown, from Burke. Nervous about presenting the changes of Leonard, the pair finally spoke to the author shortly before the first day of shooting, though the novelist apparently loved the screenplay and - reportedly - called it the best work he had ever read.\nThe book - and movie - followed a flight attendant who smuggles money from Mexico to the United States to make ends meet. She works for a black-market gun runner (played by Samuel L Jackson in the movie).\nWhen the runner discovers that one of his other couriers has been arrested - and will speak to the police to avoid jail time - he arranges for his bail with his bondsman (Forster) and promptly goes to work on the rat.\nThe critics were enamoured by the movie, \"The tale is filled with funny, gritty Tarantino lowlife gab and a respectable body count, but what is most striking is the film's gallantry and sweetness,\" said Newsweek.\n\"Quentin Tarantino puts together a fairly intricate and relatively uninvolving money-smuggling plot, but his cast is so good that you probably won't feel cheated,\" said the Chicago Reader.\nTime Out called it, \"Tarantino's finest, most mature movie to date,\" while Entertainment Weekly described Jackie Brown as \"a scuzz-bucket film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick at his most static-mesmeric.\"\nIt was a tough gig for Tarantino to do something fresh after Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and the critical vultures were circling when the director pulled in the A-list names for Jackie Brown. However, it remains one of the director's finest and most complex works to date."

LOUIS – The question has been asked so many times over the past 16 months of this presidential election that it has become a cliche: Has anyone ever seen anything quite like this? And yet, once again, Donald Trump took Campaign 2016 to places no one could have imagined when it all began.\nIn the wake of the release of an 11-year-old video of Trump speaking of actions that, if carried out, would amount to sexual assaults of women, the Republican nominee may have stepped back, issued another apology and tried to keep his demeanor in his exchange with Hillary Clinton as restrained as possible. He chose to do otherwise.\nIt’s not that serious issues were not addressed and at times serious disagreements aired, whether it was over the Affordable Care Act or the state of U.S. foreign policy under President Barack Obama. But never has there been a debate in which the attacks, the body language or the exchanges conveyed the degree to which this campaign has reached the depths of division and disagreement, not just between the two candidates but between two Americans.\nMost of the fireworks took place in the first half of the debate. By the second half, the personal insults receded slightly and it was during these exchanges that Trump sought to press his case that Clinton is a symbol of a failed status quo and that he offers not only alternate policies but also would blow up that status quo with an entirely different style of leadership.\nThose are the arguments that Trump hopes will motivate enough fed-up voters to give him the presidency. They also could make some Republican leaders think twice before they leave him. If he accomplished that, then the night can be counted as partially successful for him.\nThat means it won’t just be reaction to Trump’s performance in the debate that will affect the campaign coming days. Voters will continue to draw their conclusions about his fitness to serve as president apart from how he looked and sounded on the stage here in St. Louis. And while a rebound is possible, further slippage, or even status quo, could prove political fatal, given the precarious state of his candidacy.\nMeanwhile, Republican elected officials will make their own assessments of his and the party’s future in the context of the lewd video -and everything else they have endured from Trump both before and since he became their presidential nominee. In the hours before the debate, the list of GOP officials abandoning him continued to grow, and there’s little reason to doubt some continuation in coming days.\nSome Republicans are saying publicly that recapturing the White House is a lost cause, that Trump is so weakened that it’s too late for him to repair the damage. Their goal will be to protect their majorities in the House and the Senate.

        "text": "After wining five in a row Bnei Yehuda has lost two and drawn one of its last three premier league games.\nIt would appear the Bnei Yehuda bandwagon is beginning to grind to a halt as Betar Jerusalem maintained its perfect record away from home with a 3-2 win in Herzliya Sunday night. After wining five in a row Bnei Yehuda has lost two and drawn one of its last three premier league games. Betar has now overtaken its Sunday night opponents and is third in the table, equal on points with Hapoel Tel Aviv, but behind the second-place team on goal difference. Betar dominated Bnei Yehuda for the entire first half and was only eventually slowed down by midfielders Maor Melikson's being sent off at the start of the second half. Bnei Yehuda, which was hosting Betar at its homeaway-from-home in Herzliya, missed its real home, Bloomfield Stadium, whose pitch is being resurfaced. The hosts couldn't take advantage of their one-man advantage and, despite creating numerous chances, didn't manage to equalize. Betar began the game well and seized the initiative from the first whistle. Ten minutes from the start striker Lior Asulin found himself totally free five meters from Bnei Yehuda's goal, but his awful shot went well wide of the mark. The hosts briefly breathed a sigh of relief, but two minutes later they were one goal down. Striker Jeff Tutuana's header was well saved by keeper Vincent Enyema, but Asulin easily headed the rebound in from the goal line. Betar continued to press forward and was rewarded with a second goal. Melikson dribbled his way into Bnei Yehuda's penalty box and passed the ball to Omri Afek whose powerful shot was deflected into the goal leaving Enyema helpless. Bnei Yehuda was fortunate to end the half only two goals behind. Thirty seconds into the half the hosts got on the board. Midfielder Asi Baldot was free inside Jerusalem's box and easily headed the ball from the corner into the net. Less then a minute after conceding the goal, Betar reclaimed its two-goal lead. Midfielder Barak Itzhaki ran clear of the Bnei Yehuda defense and beat the keeper with an accurate right-footed shot. The incidents kept coming and moments after scoring the goal, Betar found itself one man down. Melikson celebrated his team goal by jumping on the Stadium fences and, after receiving a yellow card earlier in the match, the referee had no choice but to show Melikson a second yellow and send him off. Bnei Yehuda pushed forward searching for goals, but couldn't beat the Betar defense until substitute Eli Biton scored in the 90th minute."

        "text": "Charles Glascock is no longer effective as mayor of Casselberry.\nHis running turf battles with council members, his cavalier dealings with department heads, his insistence that he pull every string, all negate his positive attributes. If Casselberry city government is to be more than a sniping ground for egos, Mr. Glascock must be replaced in next week's election, and the best choice is Owen Sheppard.\nThe Orlando Sentinel also believes that the best choices for the two council seats on the ballot are the incumbents, Al Harmon and Tom Embree.\nOn paper, Mr. Glascock, 57, makes a good mayor. In the Army he rose through the enlisted ranks into the officer corps and retired as a lieutenant colonel. Since he came to Casselberry in 1969 and opened a hardware store, he has served on a long list of city and civic boards. And, no question, he has the best for his city at heart.\nHis record, though, fails to back up the paper. While council members are not blameless for the city's current troubles, the mayor goes out of his way to fuel the conflict. He dabbles with too much detail, undercutting department heads. He talks about cooperation, but then procrastinated after the council voted this year to join a fire-rescue first response program with neighboring cities.\nMr. Sheppard, 56, is a retired naval officer who markets souvenirs. He also is a former council member and mayor, having resigned the latter office because of personal problems, which he says are behind him. Clearly while in office he was a better manager than Mr. Glascock.\nThe third candidate for mayor is John Leighty, 55, a security guard who spent 12 years on the council. He espouses some good ideas, but Mr. Sheppard's experience in that job makes him the better choice.\nMuch of the mayor-council problem stems from the city's charter, which gives the mayor executive powers but no role in policy making. It is a system made for turmoil, and that leads us to the reasons for favoring the two incumbent council members. Both favor a charter change that would place management in the hands of a professional manager under the control of the council.\nIn Seat 4, Mr. Harmon, 44, a bank vice president, has one council term behind him and service in other capacities, including as a member of a charter review committee. It was in that job that he came to favor the manager form of government. Probably his greatest strength is an open mind when it comes to running the city.\nHe is opposed by Phyllis Sheppard, 56, the estranged wife of Owen Sheppard. She wants to improve the city's recreation program and make sure Casselberry is prudent in spending tax dollars. But she has no specific ways to make those savings and says she will wait until she is elected to come up with her plans. That does not express the leadership the city should expect in its council.\nIn the Seat 5 race, Tom Embree, 49, assistant vice president of a large credit union, has been on the council for eight years and has long favored going to a city manager system. He has a healthy view of dealing with neighboring cities -- cooperate, but keep the city's identity -- and believes the city should assume responsibilities rather than shrugging them off on the state.\nHis opponent is Ed Lewis, 31, a convenience store clerk who has been outspoken against the mayor and council. Mr. Lewis must be admired for his courage and tenacity, but he hasn't the experience for the job at this point. Casselberry's city hall needs strong management with harmony. The best chance to get that, the Sentinel believes, is with the election of Owen Sheppard as mayor, Al Harmon as council member in Seat 4, and Tom Embree in Seat 5."

Ola, which also allows booking autorickshaw rides under'Auto' service, had launched the offering in Bengaluru and Chennai in 2014. Ola Auto is currently operational across 73 cities with over 1.2 lakh autos associated with the company.

To expand transportation choices for our riders, we are excited to launch AUTO in Bengaluru and Pune,\" the spokesperson told PTI. In its previous attempt, Uber's AUTO offering was available in New Delhi, Coimbatore, Indore and Bhubaneshwar. \"We are re-launching AUTO starting with two cities. Gradual geographical expansion like this is common to how we operate in cities around the world and it is something that we are looking at very closely,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson added that AUTO will include all safety features available for Uber cab rides and riders will be able to pay via cash, Paytm and debit/credit cards. Uber will only on-board licensed, existing auto-drivers who have been screened and accredited by the authorities and every driver partner on AUTO will be required to submit valid government documents before they are given access to the Uber app, the spokesperson said. For Uber, India is one of its largest markets where it has seen strong growth.

In fact, it’s part of a recent trend in which gender issues have been elevated by world leaders in international fora and integrated into mainstream policy discussions.\nConsider, for example, Canada’s leadership of the Group of Eight (G8) in June 2010, which gave rise to the Muskoka Initiative on maternal and child health and led to a commitment to invest in national health systems.\nThe foreign ministers of the G8 have also highlighted the role of women in peace and security. In 2012, the ministers called for implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security. A year later, the same group endorsed a declaration on preventing sexual violence in conflict.\nGender equality has been a focus of the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit as well. In November 2014, each G20 country set a historic commitment to reduce the gap between the share of men and women in their workforce by 25 percent by 2025.\nThe G20 commitment to increase women’s labor force participation was echoed at the Kruen summit this week in the G7 declaration that emerged. It was also augmented by a new agreement to increase women’s vocational training in the developing world by one-third by 2030. German Chancellor Angela Merkel highlighted the relationship between gender equality and economic progress in her closing remarks, noting that barriers to women persist everywhere in the world—“not only in the developing countries where a lot of work still needs to be done,” but also “in industrialized countries.” She promised to convene a conference in September to address the “structural differences between men and women” that remain.\nResearch from major international economic institutions supports this focus on gender equality by world leaders. Over the past two decades, analyses from the International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and World Bank have demonstrated the growth potential of increasing women’s labor force participation. The Bank is in the process of revamping its gender strategy, and mainstreaming the discussion of women’s economic empowerment is a core piece of its new concept note.\nRecent international commitments to advance gender equality are undoubtedly a critical step forward—but the real test of progress for women will lie in their implementation. To ensure gains for women and girls—and for the health of entire communities and economies—such declarations must be coupled with a push to implement the policies they prescribe."

However, this is the first time the company has outright solicited help from OnePlus users.\nDubbed the Product Manager Challenge, the company shared a blog post asking users to think of their dream software feature – or a feature they've jealously spotted on a rival device that they believe could be tweaked or improved for OnePlus smartphones.\n\"Every day, we get hundreds of ideas for how to improve our devices. Much of this feedback gets picked up by our bug hunters or through surveys, making OxygenOS truly a software system that we’ve built together as a community,\" the post reads.\n\"But put to the test, would your idea survive the logical hoops of implementation? For those of you who’ve seen the show Shark Tank, you know what I’m getting at. If you have a dream feature you’d like to see implemented into OxygenOS, we hereby invite you to take on our Product Manager Challenge.\"\nIf you have a genius smartphone feature that has been playing on your mind, you have until February 22, 2019 to put together your pitch.\nOnePlus has listed a number of question that you'll have to answer in your post, including \"Who are the users?\", and \"If there are existing comparable functions in the smartphone industry, how is your proposed feature superior?\"\nWhoever suggested the winning entry will be invited see their idea brought to life and rolled-out to OnePlus handsets worldwide, including, of course, the forthcoming OnePlus 7. OnePlus will also invite the winner along to their next hardware launch.\nYou can find the full terms and conditions, as well as instructions where to share your idea so the OnePlus team can find it here.\nOnePlus confirmed plans to launch a brand-new 5G-compatible smartphone before it debuts its new flagship device, seemingly called OnePlus 7 early this summer. Huawei and Samsung are also expected to unveil 5G-powered handsets in the coming months, although the former will not be the Huawei P30 Pro.\nOnePlus CEO Pete Lau has forecast that bringing 5G support is likely to add between $200 (£155) and $300 (£235) to the price of a OnePlus device. Given that the maxed-out OnePlus 6T currently costs £579 ($629), the 5G-touting successor looks likely to be within sight of the £1,000 mark. With a price tag sitting around £814, OnePlus will be asking fans to cough-up a considerably more than its previous efforts.\nFor comparison, when the OnePlus 3 debuted in June 2016, it had a starting price of just £309 and a \"Flagship Killer\" tagline that taunted its pricier rivals."

The Mariners jumped all over Boston’s ace, collecting 11 hits over the 6 1/3 innings he was on the mound.\nPorcello did a good job of limiting the damage to only two earned runs during his outing, but the reigning American League Cy Young winner wasn’t pleased with his performance Sunday.\nRed Sox manager John Farrell echoed his starter’s sentiments and credited Seattle’s success at the plate to taking advantage of mislocated pitches.\nStill, Porcello did more than enough keep his team in the game. But unfortunately for the right-hander, the Red Sox bats were stymied by Mariners starter Christian Bergman, who only allowed four hits over seven scoreless innings.\nSunday’s game marked the sixth time in his last nine starts that the Red Sox failed to score for Porcello, who’s season record fell to 3-6 following the defeat. Boston only notched five hits in the contest and grounded into a season-high four double plays.\nMuch of Porcello’s struggles this season can be pegged as lousy luck, but the Red Sox’s starter plans on keeping it simple in order to get back to his winning ways.\nHere are some other notes from Red Sox vs. Mariners.\n— Dustin Pedroia went 2-for-4 with a double in Sunday’s game and has reached base in 13 consecutive contests.\n— Xander Bogaerts logged a single in the first inning with a 3-2 count on him. The Red Sox shortstop leads Major League Baseball with 202 two-strike hits since 2015.\n— Blaine Boyer made his Red Sox debut when he appeared with one out in the ninth inning. The 35-year-old journeyman turned away both batters he faced in the short outing.\n— Porcello typically is at his best when the sun is up.

Teachers are receiving training on both trauma support and active shooter situations.\nFor some students, Monday will be the first time they've been back in class since the shooting rampage, which happened toward the end of the school year.\n\"We are going to try our best to get it all right on Monday, but I'm sure there will be things we'll have to go back and tweak to get it right,\" school board President J.R. \"Rusty\" Norman said last week, according to the Houston Chronicle. \"But we will get it right.\"\nThe school has also built a new hallway so students and staff won't need to walk in the art classroom area, where authorities say Dimitrios Pagourtzis began a rampage that killed eight students and two teachers.

        "text": "I belong to a book club of women who are all moms like me. Once a year we pick a classic to read (or reread). This year’s pick was To Kill a Mockingbird, for which Lee won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize and on Monday received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I had read Harper Lee’s classic in high school and I remembered the plot, but what I did not remember was how magical Lee’s prose was, how connected I felt to Scout Finch, the narrator, and the rhythms of her life in that small Southern town. I wonder now if I forgot all of this or if I never got the chance to feel this connection when I read Mockingbird in English class.\nI was an avid reader even back then, but I often felt disconnected from the books that we read in school. I was reading James Michener’s historical tomes and Robert Heinlein’s fantasy by the time I was in high school (OK, not classic literature, but so fun to read!). The books we were assigned were so boring! It took forever to read one, stopping after every chapter to “do something” with the book: memorize vocabulary lists, hunt for examples of figurative language, and write lengthy essays from teacher prompts. These assignments killed any momentum that might have pulled me through a book, and killed my appreciation for the book, too.\nAs Mockingbird continues, Scout’s views show that she has become increasingly disconnected from the learning she must do at school. She says, “…as I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what, I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.” To Kill a Mockingbird was written in 1960 (set in the ‘30s), I was in high school in 1984, and as teachers and parents, we are still bemoaning the lack of engagement that students seem to have in school and with reading. Much research into reading has taken place since 1960, so what has not changed for students?\nI think the mistrust is still there. Teachers do not trust students to take control of their own literacy development or their own learning. We still teach books instead of teaching readers. Students are given very little control of what they read, when they read, and how they are allowed to respond. School reading still seems to be about what teachers think students should be getting out of a book. The opportunity to fall in love with a story is denied to students who have come to view school reading as an obstacle course of comprehension assignments. Teachers are the gatekeepers of knowledge instead of the guides. Should knowledge have a gatekeeper? Until we release some of this control back to our students, they will never become independent thinkers or readers. As for students like Scout and me, who walk into classrooms already readers, we will continue to wonder why our love of reading has no place in school.\nOh, yes. I knew better than Scout. I didn't let on that I could read already in first grade. But I have a vivid memory of my first in-school reading group (and how disappointed I was that there was no reading involved), where the teacher held up a picture of ALICE in a red dress and asked us about how we would know it was ALICE if we saw her on another day, in another dress. I knew I wasn't supposed to notice that ALICE was printed in big letters under her feet.\nI hated sitting in reading group, waiting as one after another had a turn at reading the same page over and over. It did teach me how to \"read ahead\" on the sly--a skill that carried me through many boring classes throughout the years.\nAs a child who read \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" independently at the age of 4 years and 9 months the summer before entering kindergarten, I felt exactly the same way in \"reading\" class. We didn't even have reading groups: the entire class read together. The first person in the first row read the first sentence, then the second person in the first row read the second sentence, and so on to the end of the story. I would read ahead, count up to my sentence, then read something else on the sly until it was my turn. Same for the worksheet -- finish it in about 20 seconds, then read a real book under the desk. I always thought that the other kids, who struggled over decoding their assigned sentences, were BETTER \"students\" than I was, because they were able to play dumb more successfully than I could! That was the lesson I learned by the end of first grade -- school was a gigantic charade, where you were supposed to pretend to learn things you already knew, for some unfathomable grown-ups' reason that kids weren't supposed to understand or question.\nMy mother went to open house when I was in first grade and was surprised to hear my teacher say, \"We have lots of students ALMOST reading!\" My mom told the teacher I really could read already. The teacher suggested that I might have memorized a few books at home, but that I wasn't reading in class. My mom came home asked me why I wasn't reading at school, and I explained that since I knew it was the teacher's job to teach me how, I didn't want to hurt her feelings. My mother told the teacher what I said; I was taken to some little room and given a reading test; I was sent to another classroom for reading every day after that, which made me pretty sure that I'd made the teacher mad--she was sending me away!\nYears later, I was in a staff development session across the table from my first grade teacher. She introduced me to the others as \"so brilliant we had to send her to second grade for reading from the start of the year!\" I never knew the other classroom was a second grade room or that it was a good thing to be sent out.\nI continually wonder what it is we do to children to make them dislike school so much. Analyzing the heck out of a novel, drill and kill with grammar, memorize this and that....No wonder kids are taking mind trips left and right to escape the boredom that surrounds them in school. I hope that more teachers read your blogs and reflect on their own teaching practices thinking how to best engage/invite children into learning again. Children begin school with such excitement. Where does it go?\nLike Kerri, I remember being puzzled by the capstone project for my kindergarten class--a series of prereading exercises bound in a large format book called \"I Am Learning How to Read!\" I'd been reading for quite some time at that point but the teacher was very excited about it, so I went along with her. Luckily, my first grade teacher was excellent at differentiation, even back in the early 70s. I got what I needed from her.\nDonalyn and others like her, from high school reading remediation teachers--Thank you for the love of reading you instill in your students and for helping others to achieve the same with students. When I taught high school remediation classes to help students pass the graduation exams, I had students who had been \"properly schooled\" but did not learn to read for the love of it. When you love it, you comprehend it--that's what I told my students. They couldn't understand why we spent 90% of our time just plain reading books and talking about what we read and only 10% actually practicing test questions. I read with them. We read to each other. They read to me--not round robin reading but the whole class period from a book they loved and wanted to share. It was glorious! Not one of my students failed the reading grad exam after a semester of breaking the \"rules\" and reading without a test or worksheet to assess comprehension! Too many of my senior level students had never read a book even though their classes were assigned books to read and they were tested on what they read. Students too often said they didn't need to read because the teacher spent too much time analyzing the book in class--they just took good notes during that analysis of what the teacher thought they needed to remember. They could pass the test without reading the book. So, thank you Donalyn for what you do with students and for how you have agreed to inspire others to be teachers like you!\nI just found your blog, and loved this entry. I grew up in a small town in Western PA, and remember reading my sister's textbooks when I was in first grade and she was in third--it was glorious then, but third grade was an awful bore.\nIt went on being boring for several years, but then in 6th grade the entire reading class involved just sitting there every day, reading whatever we wanted. Once a week we were to take a break from reading and write a letter in our journals telling the teacher about what we were reading and what was exciting about it. She would write back, too, which made me feel really special.\nFuture classes were never as fun, as we had to stay back to the pace of the slowest reader. I was a vocal kid, and eventually the 7th grade reading teacher finally acknowledged that I had read all of the books on his list of appropriate books...so he had me read War and Peace instead. Writing a book report on that one was hard! After I finally finished it, I talked to my gifted class teacher and talked her and the principal into letting me skip 8th grade reading and go take an extra history class at the high school.\nI ended up transferring to a private school where the other kids had read Shakespeare in 6th grade and I was grateful for my reading speed in attempting to catch up to all that I had missed in my semi-rural public school.\nI'm glad to see so many others who were bored to tears with school. The best thing that ever happened to me in school was in seventh grade. I went to a tiny (60 students) private school. Someone had donated hundreds of books to the school and the headmaster asked me if I'd like to spend a few hours a day sorting them. I never sorted a single book, but I spent hours every day sitting in that \"library\" reading to my heart's content -- biography, history, fiction. That good lady headmaster never said a word about it.\nI honestly do not know how I became a reader. Well maybe I do. But by all accounts I should have been illiterate. I never read growing up. I used to play outside all of the time. Then around 12 years old, my parent's subscription of Newsweek became my weekly read. I would look for it each week and read it from cover to cover. I do not know what prompted me to read and think about everything I read. I needed a lot of mental stimulation - or to think about things, anything, It was kind of odd and I do not understand what that was all about. I then started reading books and I became so immersed in my thoughts about what I would read. I was also too impressionable. At around that same age I read Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World, and became a cynic about life. Then I read Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier (sp?). I discovered my view on that book was completely different than anyone else's understanding of it. I just felt Rebecca was not liberated enough and dysfunctional as was those in her life. Too, later I felt that the book was too single faceted. But I find many authors are that way. I guess I just accept it now and add my own spin to it to make it more interesting.\nWhat is my point???? Darn I lost track. I have a child with dyslexia. Of all things. And boy have I learned a lot about the other side of the reading experience. My question, what can I do? Everything that has ever been said to help these children is ridiculous such as \"they need to practice reading\". Correction: They need to practice ACCURATE reading, not just reading. You cannot give a student with dyslexia a book and tell them to read it over and over so that they get better because all they end up learning is how to read inaccurately. It reinforces multiple mis pronunciations or multiple incorrect decoding of the same word, it becomes an exercise in mind torture and turns them off to reading. These kids need to learn how to accurately decode words. I picked up on the pattern for decoding and it became reliable for ME. Not so for my child. She will need a few more explicit trips to such letter combinations like the trigraph \"que\" and the digraph \"sc\" before she gets it and can do this automatically so it does not interfere with the meaning and therefore pleasure or reinforcement we get in order to have the incentive to read.\n2. Lots of love and nurturing - I stand next to her and respectfully correct the mistakes she makes reading the brownie directions.\n5. Lots and lots of humor- let's face it these kids need to be able forgive themselves for making so many reading mistakes. Humor re energizes and takes away the anxiety that results from all the issues related to not having the most foundational skill needed to feel competent in school.\nSo what may have worked for me -interest and a lot of curiosity, plus the opportunity to pursue reading what I wanted to read, may or not work for these special kids who are often very bright, who are in desperate need for the same intellectual stimulation that we get from reading. The same motivation to learn is there but we need different approaches.\nParent who needs a very special teacher: You are exactly right. Kids with dyslexia need explicit instruction in decoding just like you said. Practice reading incorrectly will only cause frustration. You need to find a teacher trained in multi-sensory direct instruction - Orton-Gillingham. You also need to go to the International Dyslexia Association website- www.interdys.org. They provide a great deal of support and can also refer you to a properly trained instructor in your area. The research has proven what kind of teaching works and the help is out there.\nI'm certainly glad I wasn't part of some of the classrooms described above. I always was allowed to read my own choices; and I abhor stories I hear where children are told they can't read a book because it's not on the list. Ms. Miller and I are of one mind when it comes to getting students to love reading.\nAll is seems to take in my classroom to get students reading is to help them find what they like. I do booktalks on new books all the time, and we have to have a lottery to see who will get to be first to read each one. If we take the time to be interested in students' individual choices and talk to them about their reading, it isn't too difficult to have a reading community in the classroom.\nIf you share your love of books with kids, they will respond, especially when you offer a menu with choices that connect to their own lives. Start with their comfort zone and then nudge them towards more sophisticated, challenging books as the year progresses. I'm amazed at times at what a child will delve into when they're motivated to read something on a topic they love.\nI read all of your articles listed here and I'm so happy to see there are teachers in the upper grades who feel and teach as you do. It's one of the things other teachers in my building just don't get.\nThey cannot resist stuffing their 3 and 4 year olds with information, rather than letting them learn from a rich environment with an experienced guide (the teachers). I don't understand it, and they don't understand me. They say I don't teach. They feel the children will be more ready to succeed if they're drilled in academics, I feel like they are training the majority of the children to hate school.\nLuckily my administrators are more understanding and supportive of my teaching style. What do you say to the teachers though, who like my co workers say, oh you don't teach, you're letting the kids down? Especially when they've had the same training and workshops as I have?\nIn 1962, I moved to a small, rural school where I was so advanced in reading that the teacher said, \" Honey, you can read those books while I have reading groups and the others do their work.\" The shelf was beside my desk. There were plenty of books, like Tom Sawyer, Huckaberry Finn, and others. I read them all and loved it. Keep up the good work.\nThis is what I love about finding a group of really smart people. I can find the answers to questions I need help with. Can one of you wonderfully bright minded individuals please help me?\nIs que a trigraph in the words queen queer query quercetin question or am I dealing with a quadraph with queer and queen?\nI am working on listing letter groupings that represent specific sounds and matching the words to them.\nHowever it looks as though que makes over four sounds such as in unique, quell, queen, quercetin."

It makes it easy to find the tab you want fast, see what you have open at a glance, see closed tabs, and much more.\nFoxTab gives you controls over the 3D appearance of your tabs.\nWhen you install FoxTab, it adds a new icon to the left of the Firefox address bar. Click it and you'll see thumbnails of all of your tabs in a 3D view that looks much like the Windows Vista-Windows 7 3D Flip feature. Scroll through them all until you find the one you want, then click it to go there. You can change the angle and direction of the view, and choose the background color as well. To leave the FoxTab view, press the Esc key, or click the FoxTab icon again.\nThat's just the beginning, though. FoxTab offers far more powerful tools than just a 3D look at your open tabs. You can also arrange them in other ways, including as flat thumbnails on a variety of different grids, and in a nifty view that looks much like the Mac's Cover Flow feature. You can also show tabs that you've recently closed. And you can also search through the titles and URLs of open tabs.\nIts Top Sites feature is an excellent one as well. Top Sites works and looks much like Safari. When you open a new tab, instead of seeing a blank page, you see 3D thumbnails of your favorite sites. Just click any to get to it. One drawback to this feature is that unlike in Safari, the Top Sites feature doesn't populate itself based on sites you've already visited. You'll have to FoxTabs which to put there.\nThere's one more drawback to FoxTab: It doesn't play nice with Firefox 4's new Panorama tab-handling capabilities. If you click Firefox's Panorama icon to launch Panorama, the Panorama page launches behind FoxTab so it's not visible. In addition, FoxTab won't show you the tabs you've grouped together in Panorama.\nStill, FoxTab is a very useful tool if you're not a fan of Panorama. You'll find it to be a very useful tab-tamer."

        "text": "NATICK, Mass. -- Before a series of late-winter nor'easters covered New England with heavy snow, a small group of Human Research Volunteer Soldiers from the U.S Army's Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, or NSRDEC, practiced their land navigation skills in the woodlands of nearby Fort Devens, Massachusetts.\nDuring their voluntary, 90 day assignment to NSRDEC, Human Research Volunteer, or HRV, Soldiers spend the majority of their time supporting Army scientists and engineers with human performance-based research inside NSRDEC's unique research facilities and laboratories where they test everything from new ruck sacks and prototype ration technologies, to virtual reality-based training platforms.\nEssentially, the primary function of an HRV Soldier is to be the human in the Army's human performance focused research. It's an indispensable role within a growing and pivotal field of research that is laying the groundwork to modernize the Army's greatest asset -- the individual Soldier.\nYet, as newly trained Soldiers, the fundamental combat skills they learned in basic and advanced individual training can rapidly diminish if not performed regularly. To maintain their combat readiness while serving the Army S&T community, NSRDEC's non-commissioned officers responsible for their daily supervision began incorporating a field training regimen into the HRV schedule with the first group of young Soldiers to arrive in FY2018.\n\"It's important for HRV Soldiers to be proficient in the basic Soldier skills they'll be using when they leave Natick and get to their first units\" said Staff Sergeant Anthony Sandoval, the Operations NCO for NSRDEC's Headquarters Research and Development Detachment. \"Part of our job as NCOs is to make sure they're ready.\"\nTo accomplish this, Sandoval's team of NCOs developed and implemented a condensed field and weapons training program around the HRVs busy schedules supporting NSRDEC research studies designed to brush up on their land navigation and marksmanship skills.\n\"These are critical skills for all Soldiers to have, but especially this group of HRVs because they are all 11 Bravo's [Military Occupational Specialty 11-B - Infantry] including two female Infantry Soldiers,\" said Sandoval. \"Every Soldier needs to practice repeatedly for these maneuvers become second nature.\"\nNSRDEC's NCOs made sure the field training didn't conflict with the HRV's obligations as research subjects.\n\"We started with classroom sessions for basic and advanced land navigation before bringing them out to the [Land Navigation] course at Fort Devens,\" said Sergeant Andrew Cochran, HRDD platoon sergeant. \"We are retraining them on the M-4 rifle/carbine and crew-served weapons to maintain their marksmanship skills.\"\n\"We also arranged for them to get some time on the EST [Engagement Skills Trainer] when it's not being used for research purposes,\" said Cochran.\nAs they help Army scientists' research and develop future Soldier performance capabilities, HRV Soldiers are honing their own lethality. And it's the NSRDEC's NCOs who make it happen."

        "text": "OFTEN accused of taking on too many issues, President Obama is catching flak from some of his most ardent liberal supporters, who say he’s neglecting the paramount international human-rights crisis — the Darfur genocide.\nSo they’re fasting, writing letters and posting videos on YouTube pressing him to take a leadership role he promised he’d take on Darfur.\nThe Web site “Darfur Fast for Life” showcases the frustrations of Pam Omidyar, who, with her husband Pierre, the founder and chairman of e-Bay, was among Obama’s top supporters. Joining Omidyar in her fast are such activists as Gabriel Stauring, founder of Stop Genocide Now, and Shannon Sedgwick Davis, a supporter who calls Obama’s inaction “unbelievably disappointing.” Actress Mia Farrow initiated the fast, but was advised by her doctor to stop after 12 days of consuming only water. British billionaire Richard Branson has taken over for her.\nThey’ve watched as Obama has tackled the economy, health care, global warming, the tax system, financial regulations, education reform, embryonic stem-cell research and more. Sadly, human rights don’t seem to have made the cut. (Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shocked many when she asserted recently regarding China that human-rights issues couldn’t interfere with such other issues as solving the economic crisis).\nOn a 2007 visit to the region, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called Darfur “one of the most awful places in the world.” In March of this year, it got even more awful. That’s when the Sudanese government kicked out 13 international aid organizations that provided almost two thirds of the sustenance in the refugee camps, threatening the lives of an estimated 1 million people.\nThe White House’s response has been disheartening. By the time it got around to saying anything on the situation, the aid groups had been forced from the country. Some activists felt that had they spoken up earlier and more forcefully, it could have made a difference.\nSpeaking of Darfur during the campaign, Obama said: “As president of the United States, I don’t intend to abandon people.” Yet he is. About genocide, he said, “We can’t say ‘never again’ and allow it to happen again.” But it is happening again.\nWorse, some worry that the mastermind of all this suffering, Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, is manipulating Obama’s special envoy to Darfur, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Gration. Bashir has charmed outsiders who believe (erroneously) that he sincerely desires to work to end the suffering. Activists were especially alarmed when Gration provided an overly sunny report of Darfur’s ground situation and told some privately that it could be time to ease sanctions and remove Sudan from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nHow much longer will they have to wait?"

        "text": "The fake Chamber press release distributed to reporters Monday looked like an authentic document from the Chamber, with a logo and contact information for follow-up stories. But there were clues that it was false. The name of Chamber president Tom Donohue was misspelled, and the individuals listed as press contacts do not work at the Chamber.\nAnd the press release said that the Chamber is implementing an “immediate moratorium on lobbying and publicity work opposing climate legislation” – and suggested that high-profile defections from Apple, Nike PG&E and other companies played a role in the decision.\nIn fact, the Chamber opposes – and continues to oppose – the cap-and-trade bill passed by the House in July.\nThe fake press release said that Donohue would be announcing the policy shift in a speech at the National Press Club Monday morning. Donohue gave no such speech, but Bichlbaum and other imposters posing as Chambers officials did attempt to hold a press conference at the facility Monday.\nIt came to an abrupt end when a real representative of the Chamber showed up to confront the imposters.\nBill McCarren, general manager of the National Press Club, said that an organization calling itself the U.S. Council on Climate – same initials as the Chamber– booked space at the club on Friday. On Monday, the group asked that its contact information be changed: The new information included a number for the real Chamber of Commerce, tipping off the press club that there was a hoax taking place.\nThe group used the Chamber’s logo in staging the new s conference, and also had a sign-in sheet for reporters that listed it as a Chamber of Commerce event.\nMcCarren said the group paid for the room—the typical cost is about $500—and would not be permitted to hold future events.\nthe proper headline should be \"reuters does no fact checking and makes fools of themselves\"\nI'm sure Obama fed Reuters the story.....Chicago style politics.\nI can't wait until November 2010 to run these guys out on a rail.\nunlike what the obamanation of a president thinks, Fox is the only real news outlet and they did not fall for this garbage. MSM stupidity in motion.\nI think our president should be entered into the Guinness book of records for being the first person elected president born without a brain. Waite I guess he is second, Carter beat him to it.\nHA! I can't believe they fell for that! What a buncha morons!\nThat the NY Times and the Post accepted this ridiculously worded press release without verifying its authenticity says volumes about their inherent bias and shoddy professionalism. I say this as a lifelong journalist: If they're the \"fair and balanced\" media, we're all screwed.\nAh......The \"fair-minded\" Dem propagandists do their work!\nKeep in mind that last week CNN did a \"fact check\" on an SNL skit about Obama. Will it do an \"fact check\" on this organizations activities? Will it conclude it has engaged in \"serios erroros\"?\nDon't really care if the Chamber was victimized. They have spent their time and money victimizing American's with their motive of greed. Since they began agressive actions against health care I have listed all member in my local chamber and publically asked people to boycott those businesses. It is not about the businesses promoting their businesses but the Chamber getting into mine.\nIs Obama Poised to Cede US Sovereignty?\nFALLACY - Man is causing global warming.\nFACT - The entire history of man made climate change is full of failed theories and incorrect assumptions.\nDANGER - Increasing big gov control Dictatorship as a result of the insane (or planned) US energy policy.\nSOLUTION - Increasing energy independence by investment in NUCLEAR POWER and clean coal while increasing funding for renewable energy research. Properly dismissing as irrelevant the foolish and dangerous environmental radicals - DRILL NOW. Its freedom lovers verses the STATISTS backed by an elitist hive-minded MEDIA who seek an impoverished Utopia of Socialist Orwellian drones.\nRESULT - A safer more prosperous US and world.\nSimple solutions exist but lib/progs will always reject the obvious for ideology.\nI'm sure Reuters is a \"real\" news organization like CNN that 0zer0 schill Dunn was ranting about. Yep, love those \"real\" news organizations and their hard hitting investigative journalism. No media bias at all at Reuters, AP, CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, NYTimes, WPost, etc - just hard hitting invetigative journalism ALL AGAINST CONSERVATIVES and FREE PASSES to 0zer0 and the dumbcrat libs!\nJust like 0zer0, he and his ACORN groups and State Run Media LIES!\noh wait.... that's like asking the fox to guard the hen house isn't it!\nThank goodness for the Chamber sticking up for American businesses. I can't believe the Obama administration adds the JOB CREATORS as those thrown under the bus and added to their ever growing ENEMIES LIST. This admin. is truly SCARY!\n\"Several meeting organizations fell for it.\"\nWhat is a meeting organization?\nTom Brokaw and Tom Friedman think we hayseeds need professional filters like themselves to protect us from inaccurate informations.\nKind of like climate change legislation that cannot change the climate.\nAnd they wonder why they have such a small audience.\nWhat a joke!

        "text": "Anyone who ever doubted the transformative power of Bob Dylan&apos;s music need only look to Ke$ha.\nThe irreverent pop star known for singing about brushing her teeth with \"a bottle of Jack\" turns poignant while covering a song from one of music&apos;s great lyricists on the new four-disc \"Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International.\" The project features 75 newly recorded Dylan songs by 80 artists, including Adele, Sting, Sugarland, Elvis Costello, hip-hop artist K&apos;naan and others to support the human rights organization. The album will be available internationally on Jan. 30.\nKe$ha is one of the more unlikely stars to contribute to the compilation, released Tuesday. The pop star defined by party anthems like \"Tik Tok\" and \"Your Love Is My Drug\" took on Dylan&apos;s \"Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s Alright.\" As she found herself alone in her bedroom for the first time in months, the words of the song -- about a person bidding goodbye to a lover -- took on a new, deeply personal meaning. She realized she was saying goodbye to her carefree, former life -- before big hits and world tours brought on pressure and priorities. She broke down as she began singing, and the emotion is captured on the record.\n\"Everything has changed. It&apos;s amazing, but there are moments that are incredibly lonely. This caught me at one of those incredibly lonely moments, and it really struck home. There&apos;s a line, `It&apos;s a long and lonesome road, babe, where I&apos;m bound I can&apos;t tell.&apos; It&apos;s tragically relevant,\" said Ke$ha in a phone interview. \"I think these are all positive things for young people to see that you can be strong and you can be irreverent and you can say what you want and you have the freedom of speech, but I&apos;ve learned that vulnerability is actually an asset. It can be just as much of an asset as strength.\"\nKe$ha isn&apos;t the only eye-popping name on the compilation: Nineteen-year-old Miley Cyrus does a rendition of \"You&apos;re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\" The project has a wide range of acts, from Maroon 5 to 92-year-old folk legend Pete Seeger, who sings \"Forever Young\" with a children&apos;s chorus. Dylan waived the publishing rights to his entire catalog, and all of the artists, musicians, engineers and others involved in the recording process did everything pro bono.\nAerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, who recorded \"Man of Peace,\" describes it as \"thin ice\" to cover an artist as iconic as Dylan, because not only are his songs brilliant, but his performances of those songs have become so revered themselves.\n\"(Artists like Dylan) know where (the songs) live and breathe and where the heartbeat is. So covering them can be a touchy thing,\" said Perry, who recorded the Dylan song \"Man of Peace.\" \"Hopefully you don&apos;t make it different just for the sake of making it different. I just wanted to kind of reinterpret my take on the song and just have fun singing it.\"\nLegendary country artist and actor Kris Kristofferson considers Dylan a personal friend but says he&apos;s been an inspiration and a hero a lot longer than that. Johnny Cash introduced them while Kristofferson was working as a janitor at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville in the 1960s. At 75, Kristofferson says he has been around long enough to understand and appreciate Dylan&apos;s impact on music.\n\"If you look at pop songs before Dylan, none of them were poetry like his are. He opened up the doors for creative writers and made songwriting to me what it is today,\" said Kristofferson, who covers \"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn).\" \"Music was a whole lot different when I was a little kid. Pop music was lifted up as an art form by Bob Dylan.\"\nBritish pop singer Natasha Bedingfield recorded \"Ring Them Bells\" in Nashville during her U.S. tour last year. She said she used to listen to it as a kid with her brother and sister.\n\"To me the song is about freedom, `Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf, for the innocent,\"&apos; she said. \"For me it felt quite poignant, particularly for this album, where Amnesty is all about people who are being unjustly treated.\"\n\"Chimes of Freedom\" is a follow-up to Amnesty International&apos;s 2007 collection of John Lennon songs performed by major artists, called \"Instant Karma,\" which raised over $4 million for their efforts in Darfur.\n\"Music has been at the heart of so many movements for change,\" said Julie Yannatta, who served as the album&apos;s executive producer with Jeff Ayeroff. \"Music has a way of reminding us who we are at our essence and what we need to do to live together in a better world, and Amnesty is very much a part of that.\""

        "text": "On this 70th anniversary of independence, it is appropriate to dwell on the economic and social achievements of the nation since regaining independence in 1948. Despite the economy’s underperformance discussed in last Sunday’s column, there have been significant social and economic achievements since independence.\nThe structure of the economy has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural one to a more diversified one. We have reached middle income status with a substantial increase in per capita income. Attainments in health, life expectancy, literacy and education are impressive.\nThe seven decades have been a period of economic and social transformation. The country’s social and human development has outperformed countries with higher per capita incomes and earned the country a high position in the United Nation’s Human Development Index.\nAlthough the economy grew by only around 4 percent, it has undergone a structural transformation with agriculture’s predominance in the economy being overtaken by industrial and services sectors. Per capita incomes have risen significantly, poverty and unemployment have been reduced and the country’s economic and social infrastructure has improved considerably. The most significant achievements have been in the country’s human development that is far better than most developing countries and even some developed countries. Mortality rates are low, life expectancy has reached 75 years, adult literacy has increased to over 90 percent and education has expanded significantly. Most people enjoy far better social amenities than seven decades ago.\nLargely owing to the improvements in health and education, the country has gone through the three phases of the demographic transition in the first half century after independence and entered the fourth stage of an ageing population. The country’s population growth of 2.8 percent per year in the 1950s has been reduced to less than 1 percent (0.9). Yet the annual population growth is about 200,000, as in the 1950’s.\nOne of the most significant achievements since independence was the attainment of self-sufficiency in rice. At independence, the country with a population of only 7 million imported about half her requirements of rice and much of her other essential foods. Today with a population of 21 million Sri Lanka is about self-sufficient.\nThe seventy years since independence have witnessed profound and irreversible economic changes. The economy has moved from a pre-dominantly agricultural one to one in which both industry and services contribute more to GDP. The growth of industry for export has been a striking development of the last two decades. Not only has the relative importance of agriculture declined, but its composition too has changed.\nThe economic reforms since late 1977 had a significant impact on the structure of the economy and changed the basic character of the Sri Lankan economy. The share of manufacturing in GDP has increased. Currently the contribution of agriculture to GDP is only 7 percent. The industrial sector (including construction) contributes about 40 percent to GDP. There has been an increase in the contribution of the services sector to 55 per cent today.\nThese structural changes in the economy are reflected in the country’s trade pattern. Agricultural exports that dominated the export structure from the beginning of the plantation economy till the 1980s declined to 27 per cent in 2016. Industrial exports amounted to 77 percent of total export earnings.\nThese proportions of exports are to some extent misleading. Agricultural exports are more significant than suggested by the 27 percent as value added in agricultural exports is much higher than in industrial exports.\nNotwithstanding these compositional changes in exports and imports, Sri Lanka’s trade dependence (imports and exports as a proportion of GDP) remains high. In 1950 the country’s trade dependence was 70 per cent. It was about 45 per cent in recent years. The character of the trade dependence has altered significantly. The trade dependence is more industrial than agricultural. Manufactured goods dominate exports. Raw materials and capital goods for industries account for a larger share of imports than food and other consumer imports.\nThere has been substantial increases in incomes. Per capita incomes have increased fourfold to the levels of a middle income country, poverty has fallen to 6.7 percent and unemployment is only 4.7 percent.\nSocial development after independence in 1948 is impressive. There have been significant improvements in literacy and school enrolment, reduction in mortality rates, an increase in life expectancy and significant improvements in social amenities such as housing, potable water, sanitation and access to electricity and telephones. The country achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) set for 2015.\nLife expectancy at birth increased from around 55 years at the time of independence to 75 years today. Life expectancy at birth is higher for females at 77 years than for males at 72 years. There have been significant improvements in maternal mortality, infant mortality and under 5 mortality. Maternal mortality decreased from 560 per one hundred thousand live births at the time of independence to 100 in 2015, while infant mortality declined from 82 to 8.2 per thousand in 2013. Under 5 mortality has declined to less than 19 per thousand.\nAdult literacy increased from 57.8 per cent in 1945 to 93 per cent in 2016. Female literacy improved more sharply during this period from 43.8 per cent (1945) to 92.4 per cent and male literacy increasing from 70.1 per cent to 94.1 per cent in 2015. School enrolment of children between the ages of 5 – 19 years increased from 54.1 per cent (1945) to 75.2 in 2016.\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is at 0.743 (2015) and the country ranks 99 of 177 countries. This ranking is above those of most countries at similar levels of income and higher than other South Asian countries. However, most countries in East Asia and South East Asia, such as Singapore, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea that were behind the achievements of Sri Lanka in the 1950s and 1960s, have overtaken us.\nDespite the improvements in mortality rates, literacy and school enrolment, high rates of diseases associated with poverty and poor living conditions persist. Further, the quality of health and educational services leaves much to be desired. There are also significant regional disparities and urban rural differences. The progress in social indicators could have been much better in recent years, if economic growth was more rapid. Notwithstanding these qualifications there is no doubt that the country’s social and human development indicators are impressive. This comes out very clearly when comparisons are made with other developing and even some developed countries. Amartaya Sen has placed a very high value on life expectancy as it is a composite indicator and the basic aspiration of humans. He has pointed out that life expectancy in Sri Lanka is significantly higher than those of countries with similar, and even some countries with higher, per capita incomes.\nThere have significant developments in agriculture. Ceylon in the 1950’s with a population of just 7 million imported about half her requirements of rice. Today, Sri Lanka with a population of 21 million is self-sufficient in rice in a normal year.\nThe British colonial period of the nineteenth century introduced plantations and neglected paddy and other food crop agriculture. This process was reversed from around the third decade of the twentieth century. Paddy and food crop production became the centre of growth in the 1950′s and 1960′s. Paddy production increased due to an area expansion and increases in yields with high yielding varieties adopted by farmers. Consequently the country has achieved self-sufficiency in rice inspite of a threefold increase in population.\nAlthough the country has achieved much in these 70 years of independence, it has been inadequate to resolve pressing social and economic problems of poverty, unemployment and inadequate incomes for a significant proportion of the population. The lack of pragmatism in economic policy formulation, ineffectiveness in implementation of economic programmes, excessive opposition to reforms, irresponsible union actions, and indiscipline, deterioration in law and order, weakened public administration and inability to resolve the ethic crises have all enfeebled economic progress. Other nations that were behind us have overtaken us. The pace of economic growth cannot be accelerated adequately until peace is achieved and our vision is focused on reforming political, cultural and social values.\nThe challenge before us in the years ahead is to consolidate these achievements, make qualitative improvements, catch up with the economic development of other countries and face the serious challenges especially in our external finances. National unity, social harmony, pragmatic policies and economic and social reforms are essential to achieve the government’s vision of being a rich and prosperous society in 2025."

        "text": "Justin Gatlin says he definitely thinks he is capable of bettering Usain Bolt's 9.58 world record in the 100m, while playing down suggestions that the big Jamaican is deliberately avoiding him. Gatlin was addressing members of he media ahead of today's IAAF Diamond League meet at the Stade Louis II.\nThe American, who faces a solid field, which includes countrymen Tyson Gay and Trayvon Bromell along with Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade and Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut, is also banking on Bolt rounding into top shape by the time the 100m and 200m finals come around at next month's World Championships in Beijing, noting that he thinks that will be the ideal time to face the six-time Olympic champion and reigning world double sprint champion.\nGatlin's last loss in either the 100m or 200m came in 2013, while there has been much doubt about Bolt's readiness after injury forced him out of the Paris and Lausanne Diamond League meets earlier this month.\n\"I always believe that, if one man can do it (run a record time), then another can do it, it opens up the door and that's how humans have been for years and decades,\" said Gatlin. \"At the end of the day, I do think 9.58 is obtainable; it just takes the right time, the right day and the right opponents to push you through to such a magnificent record.\"\n\"Is he (Bolt) avoiding me? I don't think so. I think he is a great showman, he's the kind of guy that will wait until when its right, and hopefully Beijing and the 100m finals or the 200m will be the right time for us to put on a spectacular show.\n\"I think it's a great lead-up to a really good story and a really good race, so it's a highly anticipated bout that is to come. In the past, in 2012, he got beaten at his nationals in the 100m and 200m, but he went out there and prevailed in the 100m and 200m, so the guy knows how to step up,\" Gatlin added of Bolt. \"I believe that he will be fit. He is the kind of guy who knows how to show up on the day.\"\nGatlin, who also brushed aside the IAAF's recent rule change that bars athletes - like himself, who have been charged with doping offences, from winning its end-of-year Athlete of the Year award, says he has been itching to break the 9.69 American record held by Gay.\n\"I don't run for awards, I run for medals so that doesn't matter to me,\" Gatlin insisted.\nBesides Ashmeade, who himself will be looking to bounce back from a horrible 20.96 last-place finish in the 200m in Lausanne recently, Jamaica's interest will come in the women's 400m where national champion Christine Day and Commonwealth champion Stephenie-Ann McPherson will face American Francena McCorory and Brit Christine Ohuruogu.\nUS-born Jamaican athlete Aisha Praught will also feature in the women's 3000m steeplechase, where she is expected to be pacing for two kilometres, in what she considers important speed work ahead of her World Championships competition.\nThe men's triple jump will again put American Christian Taylor and Cuban Pedro Pablo Pichardo going at it in what should be another assault on the 18m mark, while veteran Dawn Harper-Nelson and youngsters Sharika Nelvis, Jasmin Stowers and Brianna Rollins will lock horns in the 100m hurdles."

        "text": "A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit.\nRecently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol.\nAn initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact. After interviewing and examining him, I recapped why he had been hospitalized and explained that hospitalized for a few more days while we monitored his liver function.\nHere was a patient with a damaged liver and little mystery about what had caused it, and yet here he was, with questions about… mold?\nThis was not the first—and certainly won’t be the last—patient to ask about mold. My patients have often wondered aloud whether mold is causing their breathing troubles, sinus congestion, overwhelming fatigue, and so on. Ultimately, I told this patient the same thing I told all the others: Mold exposure was not responsible for your health problems.\nMold worries are generally unfounded. There is no evidence that otherwise healthy individuals have any reason to fear falling ill from building mold, mold inhalation, or any other type of exposure to so-called toxic mold (PDF). Even when it comes to water-damaged buildings, any medically proven associations with health issues have come with long-term occupational exposures—not household exposures.\nIf you need more assurance, look no further than a study that examined residents of post-Katrina New Orleans: It didn’t find any increased risk of adverse respiratory effects from water-damaged buildings. This helps explain why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn’t recommend routine mold testing in households, instead suggesting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) guide to mold control to ensure indoor air quality in high moisture environments.\nThat said, mold can cause health problems in certain populations—but typically, it only seriously affects patients who have underlying health conditions. Specifically, immunocompromised patients could be at risk of systemic fungal infections, and patients prone to allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma could have responses to inhaled mold.\nThere are skin and blood-testing methods available to determine whether patients truly have mold allergies or not. Additionally, anybody who has had long-term occupational exposure to mold could develop a rare disease known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which affects lung function. But beyond these medically established connections to mold exposure and medical illnesses, much of the rest is internet lore.\nSo, unless you’re in one of those rare categories, you don’t have anything to fear about exposure—and yet mold hysteria is fairly widespread. Why?\nThe answer is a depressing case study in internet-era medical misinformation, rumor-mongering, and irresponsible online doctoring. In short, some irresponsible people are drumming up fears about mold and then profiting off of those fears. These profits come at the expense of patients like mine who use these theories as scapegoats, failing to understand and tackle the real medical issues at hand.\nOn the surface, there certainly appears to be a wealth of online information about the supposedly harmful effects of mold exposure. A quick Google search of “mold” and “fatigue” will draw your attention to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\nProponents of CFS justify the condition on the basis of one very flawed study that drew an association between mold and the syndrome, relying entirely on “urine mycotoxin” data—or the levels of fungal metabolites in urine. Not long the paper was published, the CDC issued a statement on the lack of clinical validity of urine mycotoxin tests, effectively invalidating its results.\nWhen contacted for comment, Brewer said that he relies on the clinical picture and symptoms to diagnose CFS, based on the CDC’s 1994 case definition. He still offers urine mycotoxin testing to his patients, despite the CDC’s own website clearly stating that there is no “lab test or biomarker” for CFS and no single identifiable cause.\nThe mold-CFS internet monster is nothing compared to the “Surviving Mold” empire created by Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker. Shoemaker’s website discusses mold-induced chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) ad nauseum. This disease encompasses a gamut of vague symptomatology, defined as “an acute and chronic, systemic inflammatory response syndrome” in response to mold, bacteria, and other “pro-inflammatory” exposures. The scientific evidence to back up CIRS is severely lacking, and if you search for more details on specific clinical descriptors, you will end up empty-handed.\nPerhaps inevitably, Shoemaker offers to train (for a fee) other physicians with his “Shoemaker Protocol,” a program to help them detect and treat CIRS. Online memberships are offered for all website visitors, ranging in price from $19.50 per month to $175 for a 12-month subscription. The memberships offer screening tools, email consultations with Shoemaker, and other “Surviving Mold” materials.\nDespite the fact that Shoemaker has been out of clinical practice since 2013 and has come under fire by both his state medical board and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for unregulated online portal and practice methods, the website is still thriving and propagating myths that spread to other “alternative health” websites.\nWhen asked for comment, Shoemaker told The Daily Beast “you have your facts wrong,” and declined to reply to further emails.\nIf any myth is more pervasive than that of toxic mold and systemic illness, it is the earlier mentioned water-damaged buildings and “mycotoxicosis” legend. Proponents of mycotoxicosis suggest that mold in such buildings can trigger inflammatory processes that lead to immunologic changes and a gamut of symptoms—ranging from neurological complaints to pulmonary issues. The study of post-Katrina New Orleans residents should have debunked all of this, but there still is a wealth of false information online about water-damaged buildings and the illnesses they allegedly cause.\nHere, one of the biggest figures is a Dr. William Rea, who came under fire from the Texas medical board for multiple complaints, including using “pseudoscientific test methods,” offering inaccurate diagnoses, providing inappropriate treatments, practicing in an area beyond his expertise, and failing to fully disclose his practice approach with his patients. In the wake of a settlement he reached with the board in Texas, Rea was ordered to modify his patient consent forms to note that his therapies have not been therapeutically proven and are not FDA-approved.\nBut remarkably, Rea’s Environmental Health Center is still open in Dallas, billing itself as a “complete testing and treatment facility for chemically-sensitive adults and children.” Rea is actually only board certified in cardiovascular and general surgery. Requests for comment from Rea went unanswered.\nThe bottom line: Don’t believe the hype. There’s a very real reason why doctors caution patients about information available on the internet. People who might be susceptible to mold-related health effects are usually only vulnerable because of underlying health conditions, so this is a case of the chicken before the egg—or in this case, the patient before the mold."

        "text": "Rehberg attacks lobbyists, while son represents Mongolian government in D.C.\nHELENA - U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg has made a point of criticizing Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's campaign money ties to lobbyists in their battle for the U.S. Senate, but the Republican has been less vocal about his son's position as an executive with a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm.\nRehberg's son A.J. Rehberg, who has worked at GAGE since 2008, more recently became the point man for the Mongolian government's interests on Capitol Hill. But Rehberg says there is no conflict of interest and he has done due diligence in asking the House ethics committee for guidance in the situation.\nThe congressman was told lawmakers' family members are not prohibited from working at a lobbying firm. GAGE also employs former Republican U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns.\n\"There is no law, rule, or standard of conduct that absolutely prohibits a family member from accepting employment with a lobbying firm, or even engaging in lobbying-related activities,\" ethics committee leaders told Rehberg in a letter.\nRehberg was advised to establish an office policy prohibiting lobbying of his office by his son as a safeguard, even though A.J. is not a registered lobbyist, and to warn GAGE not to advertise the relationship in attracting clients. He was also told to make sure GAGE was not given extra influence as a result of hiring his son as a vice president.\n\"But Denny and A.J. have taken it a step further, establishing a professional firewall. There's an understanding between them that they just don't talk shop together,\" said spokesman Jed Link. \"Denny also made it perfectly clear to GAGE that hiring A.J. would neither help nor hurt their standing with him or his office. A.J. being on staff has no impact whatsoever.\"\nAlthough A.J. Rehberg is not a registered lobbyist for his work with GAGE, the Embassy of Mongolia considers the congressman's son \"the primary point of contact for the firm's work with the embassy.\"\nThe embassy said in a news release earlier this year that it has hired GAGE to be its first-ever lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. GAGE says on its website that it represents Mongolia to both Congress and the administration.\nBut regulatory paperwork shows that GAGE principal Leo Giacometto does the official lobbying work for the Mongolians. GAGE did not return a call Tuesday seeking comment.\nThe Mongolian embassy counts Rep. Rehberg among about a dozen House members who are part of the U.S.-Mongolia Friendship Caucus established to strengthen relations between the two countries.\nRehberg, the Republican, is pitted against U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, the Democrat, in an intense race. Rehberg has attacked Tester for taking more campaign donations from lobbyists than anyone else in Congress, and the Republican campaign has suggested the donations could lead to improper influence.\nThe issue has attracted the attention of CREW, or Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The watchdog group recently asked the State Department, in a public records request, if Rehberg has ever written the agency on behalf of GAGE or its Mongolian interests.\n\"We are routinely concerned with the issue of members of Congress using their position as profit centers for their families. In this situation it would seem that Mr. Rehberg's son may be profiting from his father's position in Congress,\" said CREW executive director Melanie Sloan.\nSloan said that any potential clients of GAGE would know the Rehberg name and be able to quickly associate A.J. to his father even if GAGE does not advertise the association. She said it would be hard for Rehberg to claim the high ground in a debate over the influence of lobbyists.\n\"For him to holler about anyone else's Washington connections is ridiculous and hypocritical,\" Sloan said.\nThe GAGE firm has deep ties to Montana, hiring Burns after he was ousted by Tester in 2006.\nIronically, GAGE until recently also briefly employed a well-known Democratic operative and former Tester employee that played a critical role in beating Burns. But Matt McKenna, who used to work for Tester and is now a consultant to former president Bill Clinton and others, says he is no longer working with GAGE.\nTester's office, which says former staffers are banned from lobbying the office, said Tuesday it however has no control over where former staffers choose to work and has no comment on those choices.\nTester's campaign didn't offer much comment on the employment of Rehberg's son as a lobbyist.\n\"This campaign will remain focused on what's best for Montana and this nation, and Congressman Rehberg's record - not his children,\" said Tester campaign manager Preston Elliott.\nGAGE has unique ties to Mongolia, in addition to representing the country's interests in the United States.\nA.J. Rehberg is also a vice president at a Mongolian uranium mining company called Mongolia Forward, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Several other GAGE employees are directors or advisers at the company, including Burns and Giacometto, known to many in Montana as a former state legislator and appointee in the administration of former Gov. Judy Martz.\nMongolia Forward says on its website it is trying to secure permits to start the mining venture.\nGAGE also leads several other Mongolian business ventures, such as a fiber optic network company, and GAGE is part owner of a Pepsi bottling operation in that country.\n\"GAGE was instrumental in securing the exclusive Pepsi bottling and distribution rights in Mongolia,\" the company's website reads."

        "text": "The writer extolling Obamacare in Monday's newspaper is misinformed, intellectually dishonest or both!\nShe stated that the Romney-Ryan plan \"could cripple Florida's seniors\" when in fact there are no forced changes in Medicare for those over age 55.\nConversely, Obamacare will impose a radical change in the Medicare program with the implementation of its Independent Payment Advisory Board composed of 15 health czars.\nFurther, we're going to be \"gifted\" with a health care plan we are forced to purchase and fined if we don't. It doesn't add a single new doctor but provides for 16,000 new IRS agents.\nIt was written by a committee whose chairman said he didn't understand it, passed by a Congress that didn't read it but exempted themselves from it and signed by a president whose Treasury secretary didn't pay all of his taxes.\nFor all of this we'll be taxed for four years before major benefits take effect by a government that has already bankrupted Social Security and Medicare!\nWhy would anyone embrace such an alternative? I rest my case!\nFlorida's transportation system is one of the most diverse in the world from our extensive network of highways to our 3,000 miles of rail, 15 ports, 19 commercial service airports and the nation's largest and most capable spaceports.\nResearch from the Florida Chamber of Commerce Foundation shows that well-designed infrastructure investments can increase economic growth, productivity and land values while providing significant increases in economic development, energy efficiency, public health and manufacturing in the project area.\nFlorida's transportation system is under increasing demands to move both people and freight. The First Coast Outer Beltway area alone has seen a 44 percent increase in population in the last 20 years. Growth outpaces increases in roadway capacity while revenues are dwindling.\nWith the First Coast Outer Beltway project, the Florida Department of Transportation is focused on state investment in efficient intermodal connections between the area's spaceports, airport, major commerce center and commercial development in order to accommodate new growth and promote new economic development activity.\nThe Florida Chamber of Commerce applauds DOT Secretary Anath Prasad and the agency's vision and commitment to bring a comprehensive approach for economic development through sound infrastructure investments.\nI read with interest the letter in Monday's edition concerning Medicare and the choice that voters have in the upcoming election.\nThe greatest threat to Medicare is not Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan but the lack of action to make the program sustainable for generations to come. Our current president is missing in action in this most important discussion. At least the Romney-Ryan ticket is broaching this most important subject. It is generally understood that the Medicare program will be insolvent in the next 10 years.\nAlso, the writer said the premiums for Medicare have been decreased by 16 percent as the result of the passage of The Affordable Care Act. This, in fact, is not true. The cost for Medicare Part B premiums has increased from $96.50 in 2011 to $99.90 for 2012. These numbers are taken directly from my Social Security benefit statements for the years stated.\nThere is a saying that has become popular recently: \"You are entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts.\"\nI think this applies to the writer claiming the Founding Fathers established the United States as a Christian nation.\nThe Founding Fathers were likely all Christian themselves, to one degree or another. But the founding of the U.S. as a Christian nation specifically is never written in any of our documents.\nThe only place where it is referenced is in the Treaty of Tripoli in 1797 where John Adams specifically says we were not founded as such.\nAlso, \"In God We Trust\" and \"Under God\" were not added to our currency and pledge until the 1950s.\nOur lack of official religion is what makes one and all feel they can come here and worship freely without persecution.\nThe Aaron Bean-Mike Weinstein race was disgusting. The barrage of campaign rhetoric by TV, radio, robo calls and printed flyers was over the top in volume and certainly in terms of negativity.\nThe causes have many roots, but two seem to stand out.\nFirst, a Supreme Court decision allows faceless political action groups to plow unlimited funds into ads.\nSecond, the mainstream media has failed to thoroughly fact check the outlandish claims made by or on behalf of candidates.\nVoters today are besieged with misinformation from all sides. The media, especially the printed press, has a moral obligation to uncover the truth/facts and provide them for the voters.\nOf course, getting the horse to drink the water is another story."
