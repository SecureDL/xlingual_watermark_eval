Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system. A significant pressure change was measured but this did not affect the flow rate. Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals. Finally, it is recommended that further testing would be needed to ensure proper operation of the filter under all operating conditions.\nHercinger, Frank; Kidman, Beau; and Van Syckel, Seth, \"Transmission Intake Filtration System\" (2002).

For many remainers, voting for any form of Brexit will be a step too far in any circumstances. For more pragmatic remainers, though, the temptation to back a deal, depending on the softness of its content and the degree of compromise made by May, and which has also been agreed by the EU27, will be a serious option. Faced with a choice between an imperfect deal that retained significant connections to Europe, and no deal with Europe at all, many pro-Europeans may decide it is time for them to compromise too, because, like it or not, they have a dog in this fight."
