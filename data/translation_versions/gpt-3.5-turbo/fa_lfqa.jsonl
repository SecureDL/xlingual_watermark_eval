That said, the exact meaning of the 2nd Amendment and its relation to whatever type of ban you're talking about is up for debate, so the more real answer is:@@@@@@Second, because a large percentage of Americans dont want it. Probably a majority are against \"banning all guns\", but enough oppose *any* sort of gun restrictions to stop any laws about it from being passed at the federal level. In fully blue states, there still just isn't the desire in the public or in state governments to ban all gun ownership, even if it was constitutional."

It would only stop the law abiding citizens from defense against those who aren't. Unfortunately, things aren't as cut and dry as you would like to believe.",
                "For one… it’s very illegal. It’s a constitutional right, second only to freedom of the press. The only way to do so would be another amendment, and I think it would be no exaggeration to say the population would be *up in arms* about it.@@@@@@There’s also the technicality of once you’ve banned all those guns, how are you going to get them from the people? Sure some would probably turn them in, buyback programs would get some more, but what about the rest? That’d be a lot of shooting to pull that off.@@@@@@There’s also the issue that banning guns won’t get rid of them. Firearms is a huge industry, and there’s a lot of demand. Just because people couldn’t buy them in stores doesn’t mean they wouldn’t get into the country. And I’d also argue that many of the people motivated enough to carry out murders would find a way to do it without one. If they’re motivated enough for mass shootings, they’ll figure out how to get the guns anyway, or make a bomb instead.@@@@@@Finally, if you think tracking firearms can be troublesome now, imagine once they’re banned. No registries (because they wouldn’t be needed) makes it a lot harder to trace ownership and sourcing. Not something law enforcement would be thrilled to deal with I think.@@@@@@Yes, sometimes there are problems with guns. I’m not denying it. But I firmly believe banning guns wouldn’t solve very much, and might actually inflame a few issues.",

So gang crime would be unaffected. Number two, there's good arguments for their use in personal protection. Third is a bit of a two-parter. Americans have a strong sense that they should be able to do something if it doesn't hurt anyone else. Coupled with the fact that the government is Constitutionally barred from simply taking away person property without the owner misusing it first, that means the government can only legally take guns away from criminals."

For example, attempted murder might be 15-20 years, armed robbery might be 10-15 years, and illegal possession of a weapon might be 3-5 years. @@@@@@Let's say a person is convicted of 5 counts of attempted murder, 1 count of armed robbery, and 1 count of illegal possession of a weapon. Add the prison terms for all of those convictions up and you get 88-120 years. Obviously no person old enough to commit those crimes is living an additional 120 years. Now you can't just combine them all and say \"life\" because you have to sentence on each conviction separately. That way, if one conviction gets overturned later on appeal, the person doesn't get set free - they're still in prison on the other convictions. 1 conviction, 1 sentence.@@@@@@Now there are 2 ways that person can serve those combined sentences. Concurrently, or consecutively. Concurrently means the timer starts for all those sentences at the same time, so since the longest sentence in the above is 20 years, the person gets out in 20 years because they served the all the sentences at the same time. Consecutive means you only serve one sentence at a time, one after the other. So in the above example, you'd serve 20 years for the first attempted murder conviction, then another 20 for the second and so on.@@@@@@There are different reasons why someone might be sentenced concurrently vs consecutively. Sometimes, it's the judge's discretion, and they might take into account the number and severity of the charges and any prior criminal history. Sometimes, it's part of a plea deal to serve sentences concurrently instead of consecutively because it means less prison time. Other times, there's a law that says how certain types of sentences have to be served in certain situations."

                "So, everyone is right that courts determine guilt, but I think that side-steps your question. There are plenty of cases where everyone in the room already knows the person is guilty of *something* - say, because they were caught on film by a multitude of witnesses all recording the event separately and while committing the crime in clear view in broad daylight they announced their full legal name, birth date, and social security number. In these cases, the lawyer can help defend them against a specific charge. For example, let's say everyone sees you stab someone to death. You are definitely guilty of *some* kind of murder, but there are multiple \"levels\" of murder. Your lawyer would argue that you are for sure guilty of murder 3 (with a max sentence of, I dunno, 20 years or whatever), but you are *not* guilty of murder 1 (with a max sentence of life) - which is what you're being charged with.@@@@@@Which brings up the other thing lawyers do, which is protect your rights even if you're not contesting at all and are just pleading guilty. They help navigate the legal system so that, say, even if you're being sentenced to life in prison, the lawyer can argue terms like chance for parole after a number of years. Or, say you murdered three people and you get three 20 year sentences. You could serve those consecutively (20 years and then 20 years and then 20 years, so you spend 60 years in prison), or concurrently (at the same time, so just 20 years in prison counts for all three sentences). Your lawyer could argue that your sentence should be concurrent. There are myriad ways that your rights can be violated, even accidentally, and lawyers are there to help prevent that."

His kid was crying and asking “will I be reborn after I die?” And the father was at a loss.@@@@@@Both of them were entirely inside their egos, looking out. We all know that individuals die, and if our ego is what’s driving us, then that death is pretty terrifying. Because ego is “me,” the I who is speaking when we say “I think, therefore I am.” People deeply in the grip of their ego ponder death and they see endless black. Because they personally aren’t living, and they, personally, are all they really know. To them, it’s like the whole universe will blink out. This is ego. Thinking that the “you” is the frame around the entirety of reality. That when your body dies, endless black comes.@@@@@@Some believe that this ego, this attachment to your personal subjective perspective, is a delusion or a form of blinders. Sure, we each have a subjective experience of the world, but we are also all part of the great wide world and each other. As Alan Watts said: “How can I say where my self begins and ends? If my heat stops beating, I die. But if the sun stops shining, I also die.”@@@@@@Seeing yourself as part of the grand fabric of society and reality is a form of ego death. You no longer think of your skin as your boundary. The entire universe doesn’t disappear when you close your eyes, even when you close them for the last time. Life is a game of peek a boo, and only children wonder if the world is still there when you’re not looking at it.@@@@@@I’m raising kids right now and they’re a constant mind trip. I remember what it was like to be their age, and so afraid of needles that I would stress out over a shot for days. I remember so much of what I see them going through. I often get this kind of feedback wobble where I’m caught between seeing their experience outside me and remembering my own from the inside and the two seem the same for a second, and I’m no longer a dude looking out at the world but the world looking in at a dude. All of these little moments of ego death.@@@@@@At this point I look at death as calling in sick permanently. I won’t be there but work will continue. I got to see the world while I was here and, even, to learn about the cosmos. There’s so much of it, and it’s so intricate and beautiful. What’s subtracted from it by the removal of my tiny presence? Not much. Or, if you’re my kid, maybe everything. Both are true. @@@@@@In this life we get total possession of something small (our subjective self) but also a small representation in something BIG (the cosmos, reality). The fact of me is small but it’s also written, now, forever. I happened, and nothing can change that. I’m not really sure what to *do* with my participation in the cosmos… what my options even are. But so far I think just perceiving it as it really is might be enough.@@@@@@I don’t get sentimental about nostalgic things. I actually care very little for stories about my childhood, or the town I grew up in. I like some parts of the world better than others, but it’s all my home. I don’t mean that every leaf and bird is a part of me and I’m a part of them. I mean we’re all part of something greater than any of us. Not some grandiose secret power or purpose, just reality in all its glory, in all its moments. Sometimes I hear people debate “the meaning of life” and it’s just such a silly, sad concept to me. Like there’s some *answer* to that. The universe is the answer, it’s literally the response. To that question, to every question. What “meaning” does anyone need beyond that? Just drink it in.

This is the ego at work. The ego does not like to be wrong. After many years of self reflection, I was able to let go of the ego and let the criticism become positive - a learning experience to improve myself.@@@@@@In what is my favorite example of the ego, it can cause us to defer responsibility. The best example that I like to give is the woman who sued McDonalds because the cup of coffee was handed to her in the drive thru and she spilled it on herself after trying to open the lid and add cream. The coffee was extra hot and she ended up burning herself. She sued (and won) and the result was that McDonalds had to start providing insulator sleeves for the cups that clearly indicated the cup of coffee was hot. Now, I'm not arguing that either side was right (there is evidence that suggests that McDonalds was definitely using too hot of water), but what I do want to point out is that SHE spilled the coffee and burned herself. Therefore, from a purely logical standpoint, she alone is to blame for burning herself. However, her ego came in and told her that it was not her fault, it was someone else's. Again, the point of this is that accepting responsibility is what helps us grow as human beings. How can we accept risks in life if we are never willing to accept the consequences? We learn from mistakes. When we do not accept responsibility for our actions, we are preventing ourselves from personal growth.",

                "Okay, so this one is a little hard to answer, because different countries at different times have had different ideas about how society should work. The first written system of law that we know of was called the code of hammurabi. It was unique because it was the first time someone could point to a punishment for a crime, and call that punishment an abuse of power. The fact that the code was written down was important, because it ensured that everyone knew what was going to happen when they broke the code. Before written laws, rulers judged the guilty completely arbitrarily (This is inaccurate, because spoken legal codes aren't arbitrary, but they are difficult enough to verify that they might be arbitrary), and no one could say whether this was right or wrong based on anything but their own feelings or by past examples that might not actually be good comparisons.@@@@@@Prisons are just one method of dealing with crime. A few hundred years ago, you could be imprisoned for being mentally ill, or you could be imprisoned for owing someone else money and being unable to pay. You might be imprisoned for the color of your skin, or your religion. You might be imprisoned for your politics, or even the crimes of your parents, siblings, cousins, etc. Let's not focus on these, because most of these systems are very transparently about ensuring that a preferred kind of person maintains power over other kinds of people.@@@@@@Let's instead turn to what we'll call \"criminals\", which we'll mean here to be people who act in ways that are generally agreed to hurt other people, either financially or physically. The purpose of incarcerating a person who hurts others has very little to do with the person who hurts others. This is why prison is such a harsh, brutal place throughout human history. Given how we've treated them, we actually don't care very much at all about prisoners.@@@@@@Many people suggest that the idea of prison is something that grew out of state sanctioned killings and maimings and the sale of criminals into private slavery. Back in the day of Hammurabi, there were a few types of punishment for crimes: Beatings, cutting off body parts as punishment, killings, and remuneration, a fancy word for just paying for what you did to someone else with something of value. Usually money, sometimes crops or cattle. Prisoners were often state-run slave labor camps, but this became less and less true in the west over time as people began reacting poorly to the inhumane conditions in which prisoners lived, and while we didn't eliminate state slavery, we did make it appear much more like voluntary employment as the centuries passed.@@@@@@Nearly all methods of punishment for code violations serve a singular purpose: Making sure that people agree that the society is stable enough to participate in so that people can cooperate and so that trade can happen. Prisons help ensure that people feel safely isolated from criminals, even if we understand that plenty of criminals walk the street, or that new crimes are committed every day, it is enough that we have a system, and those who commit really bad crimes are kept separate from people who don't. This makes people feel as though there is justice in the world, and that we can be pretty certain that the really bad people aren't out there just waiting to beat us up and take all of our stuff. A society cannot function as long as there is fear that it is dysfunctional.@@@@@@It's no coincidence that ostracism (forcing someone to go live somewhere else) fell out of favor as countries got larger and more powerful. Instead of just making someone a problem for some other community, we can just stick them in a place and forget about the threat that they pose for a while. The point of prisons isn't to 'fix' crime. It's to make people feel safe because it gives the impression that only the people who can cooperate in our society are allowed to walk around freely. Again, this isn't really true. But it seeming true enough for people to not think about it too hard is what matters.@@@@@@Even if it's not true, the idea that society doesn't work is more dangerous than the times that society doesn't work. Prisons act as a warehouse of examples of society \"working\", and for some people, this acts as a report card on how well society feels like it is working. Research doesn't show that harsh prison sentences actually reduce crime, so this isn't an argument that prisons actually make society safer. Just that they appear to do so for many people, which is the important part: The perception of safety.",

For instance Jesse James was wanted “Dead or Alive,” but when Robert Ford just shot him in the back he was convicted of murder.  @@@@@@Bounty hunters still exist, and they can kill in self defense (as can anybody else), so they never really went away even if that specific wording did."

                "The US governmental agencies quite rarely put out explicitly worded ”dead or alive” notices; this was a custom more common to private law enforcement (such as Pinkertons). The US legal system did not deem it right to kill a suspect without trial, and hence the governmental organizations would not do this on just suspecting someone of a crime. Pinkertons, banks, and railroad companies would however do this - this is when private companies would take the role of judge, jury and excecutioner.@@@@@@However, the concept of outlawing did exist. This meant that when a person who was accused of a crime did not show up in court to defend themselves, they could be deemed to be no longer under the protection of the law - so killing them would not incur murder charges in most cases.  Thus even the government-assigned wanted posters would effectively be ”dead or alive” when the wanted person was an outlaw.",
                "One thing to note is that in reality, a dead-or-alive bounty on someone did not mean you had the right to murder that person, the way it's often depicted in movies and games. The intent was that you provided information leading to that person's conviction, or delivered that person to the nearest sheriff. The 'dead' portion refers to the fact that you could still collect the reward if you provided evidence showing that the person had already died, or killed that person in self-defense while trying to bring them to the sheriff. Most bounties did not even go this far, and would only pay if the subject was convicted, or at least stood trial. If you just went to the person and shot them, not only would you **not** get your reward, you would be charged with murder. The most famous example of this is Robert Ford being convicted of first-degree murder after attempting to claim the bounty on Jesse James.@@@@@@These bounties still exist. It is common to see a reward for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of someone. Most countries have some variation of the concept of citizens' arrest, allowing ordinary people to restrain criminals for the purpose of bringing them to police or detaining them until police arrive. So they never really went away. If you spotted Jason Derek Brown (one of the FBI 10 Most Wanted right now, a murderer and fugitive) today, duct taped him to your passenger seat and drove to the nearest police station, you would probably still get the $200,000 reward out for \"information leading to his capture.\"@@@@@@Why and when did they become less common? In the 1900s - 1920s, as federal law-enforcement agencies formed (e.g. the FBI in 1908), private agencies like the Pinkertons lost their status (in part due to their own criminal actions and hostility towards them due to their union-busting work), and detective branches became important parts of police departments. Prior to the 20th century, detectives weren't a major part of most American police departments. There might be no detectives at all for a hundred miles if you lived somewhere rural, and no federal agency responsible for investigating crimes nationwide, so offering financial incentives for private citizens to do detective work was necessary. Once you could call local detectives or the FBI, with their far better resources, powers, scope, ability to collaborate with police in different locales, etc etc, bounties became less important. (An important detail here is that most of the rewards were offered by private companies, not the government; the biggest ones were for train-robbers and offered by railroad companies.)@@@@@@Once detectives, the FBI, etc properly existed, the government far preferred that people send in tips rather than try to apprehend criminals themselves, for a variety of reasons. Ordinary citizens trying to apprehend serious criminals got themselves killed. They were were heavily incentivized to go in solo or with as little support as possible, to maximize their share of the reward, which didn't help. When they tried and failed to make a capture, the criminals would usually flee (because a killing or missing person draws attention, because they might've told someone where they were, etc). If a citizen instead told the police/FBI where the criminal was, then the police/FBI could send in a whole team of properly trained and coordinated agents to make the capture. The police/FBI can also properly surveil the target beforehand, gathering evidence that will help in convicting them or lead them to the target's fellow gang members etc. Thus instead of 'wanted, dead or alive' the not-that-dissimilar modern bounty is 'for information leading to the capture of.' And this became more and more the preferred thing as phones, cars, radios, etc came into play, and you could actually make a call and get law enforcement to show up pretty quickly after spotting someone, rather than send letters or telegrams to cities a 3-day ride away.@@@@@@Another factor is obviously the risk that vigilantes will target the wrong people, which did happen. You suspect that the strange guy you just rode past is that kidnapper-hitman you've seen a bounty out for, so you pull your gun and try to detain him. He sees some stranger pulling a gun and trying to detain him and shoots you back in reasonable self-defense, or maybe he thinks *you're* the kidnapper-hitman. It's messy and risky, and *tends to* work out better when it's a group of uniformed police or FBI agents making an arrest.@@@@@@Another detail worth noting is that the notices practically never featured photos. During the 19th century, taking and printing photos was expensive. You might go to a photo-studio and get a portrait taken every few years, and get one or two copies to display on your mantle and your parents' mantle. Most people didn't have yearbooks full of photos, boxes of snapshots of their friends, photo IDs, etc, there were obviously no driver's licenses and they weren't on passports. If you wanted to get a photo of a criminal, you'd go to their family and ask for one; if they didn't give you one (because they don't want to cooporate in getting the subject captured/killed, because they don't exist, because he never got his photo taken, ...) then you're out of luck. And if you *do* get one, it's a big expense to print out even a few dozen flyers with a detailed photograph. It almost never happened."

If you’re going to have/state an opinion about something so controversial as this trial—regardless of *which* side you’re on— you should at LEAST get the basic freaking information correct. @@@@@@During the trial, the prosecution showed/admitted that they’d had ahold of the drone-thermal-imagining video **this whole entire time** & they’d “accidentally” sent the defense a less clear/more condensed version of said video. In which the condensed/fuzzy/blurry version didn’t paint Kyle in a good light… BUT the true/full/clear version showed that Rosenbaum and his little girlfriend had INDEED followed Kyle to the car lot; they ambushed & cornered Kyle (who didn’t have his weapon raised at that point btw bc he was actually carrying a fire extinguisher to put out a car fire). When Kyle saw them approaching him, he yelled out repeatedly, “friendly! Friendly! Friendly!” bc he didn’t even know at that point that they’d been trailing behind him purposely for several hundred yards. @@@@@@He tried to let them know he was *not* intending to be a threat to them. Until Rosenbaum decided to LUNGE FORWARD TOWARDS KYLE’S GUN (this is corroborated in witness testimony, that Rosenbaum was lunging towards his gun) and THAT is when Kyle raised his gun from a 45 degree angle to shoot Rosenbaum.",
                "The situation you describe as a bouncer - \"someone threw a bottle at me so I fought them\" - isn't typically a self defense situation.  The person who threw a bottle at you no longer poses a threat or, if they do, the threat isn't that serious.  Its a much different situation than someone who is being attacked by rioters.@@@@@@You're also using the outcome to determine whether a crime was committed.  IE, you're saying \"someone died so Rittenhouse must have done something wrong.\"  That's not how the law works.@@@@@@Self defense gives you the right to defend yourself with proportional force.  If you reasonably believe that someone is going to kill *or* seriously injure you then you're allowed to use lethal force in response.  Once you are allowed to use lethal force, the outcome no longer matters.  If you shoot and kill the person, wound the person, or miss and leave them uninjured its all the same.  If you had the right to use lethal force to defend yourself then you had the right to shoot the gun.  At that point the outcome is your attacker's problem, not yours.@@@@@@I'm going to give this bit because you're saying \"I'm a bouncer and this is how I was told it works...\" - a lot of employers will tell you that the law requires you to act in an overly cautious manner because they don't trust your judgement and don't want to be responsible if you try to max out on what's legally permissible and screw up.  Bouncers are a particularly extreme example of this because your job involves hurting people - often times under legally ambiguous circumstances.  If you seriously injure someone and you weren't allowed to, your employer can be both criminally and civilly liable for that.   Your employer would much rather have you file a workers comp claim than get brought up on a conspiracy battery charge, so they tell you to act very cautiously."

In addition if a women leaves her husband she is not permitted to take her children since child custody always goes to the man in this country.   @@@@@@So this women, she has committed a crime.  This country approaches the US and says, \"She has committed a crime, give her to us, so she can stand trial\".  In America, what she has done is not a crime at all.  So they don't want to arrest her and sent her back to her home country.@@@@@@Lets use another example.  Someone murders someone in a American state.  In that state this crime carries the death penalty.  @@@@@@This murderer flees to Canada.  Now the US wants to extradite this person so they can face trial.  Canada has a problem, Canada does not believe in the death penalty but if they arrest this person and send them back to the US it would be as good as killing him themselves.  @@@@@@Canada also does not want a murderer roaming free in their cities so they offer to arrest the person in Canada the try them in a Canadian court.  Or they send this person back to the US with the agreement that the death penalty will not be used.@@@@@@So extrication is complicated because different countries have different definitions of what a crime even is.  Even in cases where we all agree it's a crime we don't always agree on punishment.  That's not even touching on who's a citizen of what country and who's laws should be enforced on who. @@@@@@Last issue is even more complicated, what if the country in question does not have a fair legal system.

The US wants his home country to arrest him and send him back to the US for punishment.

These provisions essentially sketch out that hosts cannot be held liable for infringing content hosted on their domain as long as they meet a number of reporting and compliance procedures. If they don't meet these requirements, then they *might* be found liable for infringement themselves.@@@@@@While the requirements are slightly different based on what kind of domain it is, a common feature is the notice / take down system. Any given domain has to have the ability for individuals whose intellectual property rights might be infringed to provide notice, and for the potentially infringing content to be taken down.@@@@@@The domain complying with that request is *not* determinative of whether or not the content is actually infringing. The only thing that it *is* indicative of is that whoever possesses the intellectual property rights, or their agent, has made a notice / takedown request pursuant to the DMCA with the domain. @@@@@@In order to make that request, the IP holder or agent ONLY has to verify that (1) they are the owner / agent, (2) that \"[they] have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\"@@@@@@If they certify that both of those criteria are met, then the Domain will, without determining validity, take down the allegedly infringing Content without further investigation.@@@@@@Now, you as a creator believe that you may meet the criteria of fair use. It is possible that is the case. For something to be fair use, it depends on (1) whether the use was transformative, (2) the nature of the original work, (3) to what degree and amount it was potentially infringed, (4) the effect of the use on the potential market.

                ">\tHello, I recently got my credit card info stolen and lost a certain amount of money.@@@@@@First, that should *never* happen. A credit card that is used fraudulently will result in charges on your card that *you don’t need to pay*. Report them as fraudulent and your card issuer should have them suspended immediately and after investigating remove them completely. I have had my card info stolen before and have never lost a cent from it.@@@@@@What might have happened is you were using a **debit** card which behaves similarly to a credit card but withdraws directly from your bank account. That money is just gone and you generally have no recourse to get it back. Because of this using a debit card is a very bad idea and I suggest you never use it unless to withdraw cash from your bank's ATM. Otherwise use a real credit card.@@@@@@>\tI was wondering what could even stops these people from abusing of this activity@@@@@@The use of a chip helps with this. When you just swipe a card a sequence of numbers is read off the magnetic strip. This is basically the information on the card face itself. A criminal can just write that back onto another card and use it somewhere else.@@@@@@But when you insert it into a card reader the metal contacts on the chip are used to talk to the chip directly, causing a unique code to be generated. That code can't be reused for other transactions like the magnetic strip, and the output can't be used to duplicate the chip. Every transaction produces a different code that is still able to be determined to be valid or invalid for your card.@@@@@@Unfortunately this requires the card reader to be able to communicate in real time with the credit card company's servers to check the codes. It is way more secure but more troublesome.@@@@@@>\tCould they just buy 100+ iPhones and sell them to make 100k+ each month?@@@@@@Probably not. The credit card companies have programs that look for suspicious behaviors; a customer normally only has transactions on the east coast of the US and then suddenly without a transaction with any airline there is a transaction in Italy on the border of Croatia where they are trying to buy $200 worth of cigars? Probably fraud. So huge transactions or improbable events are caught quickly and automatically, and vendors can even recall shipments in route before the criminals can obtain them.@@@@@@>\tPlus, those people must keep that money in some account right?@@@@@@Usually there is a laundering step there. Some kind of good that can be easily resold is bought so where the cash ends up can't be tracked down."

This means that most of the money to be made is being captured by the people who actually collect the numbers, which requires some combination of hacking, deception, or physical theft.

                "UK law has had a \"right to bear arms\" clause in various forms since guns were invented, but they slowly became more restricted over the years. Gun licenses came in in the 1920s, were expanded in the 60s, but up until 1986, it was perfectly possible for a private individual to own a gun - even a handgun.@@@@@@In 1987, an incident occured called the Hungerford Massacre. A young gun enthusiast went on a handgun and automatic rifle killing spree, murdering 16 people, including a few teenagers, then killed himself. Motive was unknown and will never be known - it seemed like some kind of psychotic break.@@@@@@Off the back of the Hungerford Massacre, one year later, parliament passed the snappily titled Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988. The act covered a lot of things, but the main bit we care about is that it wholly banned private ownership of the vast majority of firearms. It's an extremely specific law that lays out what you can do with which guns.@@@@@@In 1996, there was another mass shooting, the Dunblane Massacre. To this day, Dunblane is the deadliest mass shooting that's ever occured in the UK; a pedophile broke into an elemental school and shot dead 16 young children and a teacher, injured another 15, then shot himself. He used four handguns for the spree.@@@@@@Following Dunblane, there was a huge public surge of anti-gun sentiment. Hungerford was only 9 years prior and very fresh in people's minds. The Snowdrop Petition was the biggest public face of it. Following a formal enquiry, the Firearm Amendment Act 1997 blanket-banned all handguns, in all circumstances.@@@@@@As far as sentiment... My understanding is that post-Hungerford, the UK developed a modest anti-gun sentiment. Dunblane spurred that into a huge anti-gun force; many people found the killing of so many innocent children incredibly hard to tolerate.@@@@@@A gun amnesty program was set up after Hungerford, and gun owners were tracked down via the gun license system.@@@@@@Understand that UK gun culture has always been different to US gun culture. Even when the legal landscapes were more comparable, the UK did not have the culture of \"guns as a self-defense right\" like the US did and does. They were mostly used for hunting and other sport. And remember, hunting is a rich person's pursuit in the UK, not a working class one.@@@@@@Since Dunblane, there has been one more mass shooting in the UK; the Cumbria Shootings in 2010. A man used a sawn off shotgun and a bolt-action rifle to kill 12 people and harm a further 11. He also killed himself at the end. The guns were legally owned and licensed (although the shotgun had been illegally modified).",
                "The handguns in question were already rigorously controlled and existed only in the context of sport. No one (legally) had fire arms for self-defense, therefore public opinion merely had to balance the recent horrific massacre of children against the hobby of a very few people. There was no political, psychological or practical component to it.",
                "You assume the world can't cope without having one. I'm very happy about it as is rest of the UK. Our weapon of choice is sarcasm and passive aggressive comments, not portable killing devices. True we have knives, but I've rarely heard of knife attacks in the UK.

                "For context, the basic legal position in the UK regarding firearms in general changed after the First World War.  With civil war breaking out in Ireland and several European countries having had revolutions, there was a general feeling that having lots of firearms just generally in circulation was a risk to the public.  The legal position was established that if you wanted to own a firearm, you had to register it with the police and get a certificate for it, and that you had to provide an acceptable reason for wanting it (not just \"I like guns\", though at first, \"self defence\" was accepted), and the police could turn you down if they felt you were not a safe person to own a gun.@@@@@@The general position legally and in the public mind was that restrictions should placed on legally buying guns, with checks to make sure that the gun owner is a \"safe\" person, and regulations on the safe storage and handling of guns to reduce the risk of either accidental harmful use or theft as a means of guns getting into the hands of criminals.  Gradually from 1920 until the mid 1980s, the focus was on reducing the number of guns generally in society, with occasional amnesties to remove guns from circulation that were no longer wanted (there was the problem that if you had an illegal gun that you no longer wanted, it was easier to sell it illegally to a bad person than to legally get rid of it).  People generally had the view that there are legitimate reasons to own a gun, such as marksmanship, hunting or agricultural uses, if you aren't actually doing one of those things, it's probably better not to have a gun at all.@@@@@@The major change in approach happened with the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987, and then in Dunblane, in a school, in 1996.  In each case the shooter legally owned their weapons. It was felt that each of these shootings was made more harmful due to the kinds of guns that were used.  After Hungerford, things like high capacity magazines, pump action shotguns and the like were banned.  The reasoning was that those features did not provide utility for the legitimate uses of firearms but made them more dangerous in the situation where they came into the ownership of a bad person, either legally or otherwise, so the best option is just to get rid of them entirely.  After Dunblane, the same logic was used for hand guns, that there is no legitimate need for a gun of greater than 0.22\" calibre (that being adequate for marksmanship), or a few specific exceptions for things like museum pieces, and that the risk of a bad person doing another Dunblane with them was something society was not willing to risk, so on balance it was most sensible to just not have them at all.

Yes they have the power to order others to kill, but *generally speaking* there's no laws against just telling someone else to kill someone...the crime generally lies with the person who does the killing. They could probably be charged with being an accomplice or accessory or something though.  @@@@@@2) In a perfect operation the only people who are killed are considered enemy combatants. That is, a person who lawfully (or unlawfully) engages in hostilities for the other side in an armed conflict. Yes, it is still one person killing another, but there are laws that protect certain types of killing during war. If the person killed is an enemy combatant, then the person who killed them would be protected and backed by the full power and authority of the side they are on. For example, if a US soldier kills an ISIS member during a conflict, ISIS can attempt to convict the US soldier but the US isn't going to turn the soldier over to them, and the US government isn't going to convict the soldier either because they killed an enemy (of the US) combatant. However, if that soldier kills a civilian there's a chance they are charged by the US government with a crime - more-so if it can be proven as an intentional act.  @@@@@@tl;dr - Leaders aren't directly killing so an accomplice or accessory charge is the only thing that could potentially hold up, and if the person killed is an enemy combatant it's generally an excusable murder by the country who did the killing.  @@@@@@Things are rarely perfect though, and innocent people are killed all the time in war and things get swept under the rug, blame gets thrown around until your head spins, people come up with excuses as to why it happened, any rarely anyone gets charged with murder unless there's substantial proof that wrongdoing was done.",

                "A marshal is to the state or federal government what a sheriff is to a county:  they and their deputies are the enforcement branch of the judiciary.  They work for the court system.@@@@@@State or municipal police, by contrast, are the law enforcement branches of their respective executive governments.  The FBI as a federal law enforcement branch serves a comparable function at the federal level.  They work for mayors, town councils, governors, or the US Attorney General, depending.@@@@@@(This is not to be confused with the US Federal Air Marshals, who used to work for the Department of Transport but now work for the Department of Homeland Security -- they are not part of the same system as the US Marshals in any way.)@@@@@@Edit:@@@@@@Since you asked specifically in the context of the American Old West, first of all historically the US Marshals are exactly as old as the country itself, they were one of the first things the US Congress established, as part of inheriting so many English concepts about how jurisdictions should be organized.@@@@@@Wherever there was US law, there were US courts, and wherever there were US courts -- however distant the courthouse itself might have been -- there were US marshals.@@@@@@In the Old West in particular, marshals often appeared in situations where there was no other law enforcement, due to there being none by law such as in an unorganized territory, or due to there being none in practice because of corruption, long-lasting vacancy, lack of organization, lack of budget, or whatever.@@@@@@So, often, that role and title come to stand for the \"lone lawman\" concept so common in Western genre fiction.  It is as close as reality ever came to that trope.  (And in fact it often came quite close.)@@@@@@A serviceable example is in the movie *Django Unchained*, in which the bounty hunters go out of their way to breach local law, so as to draw the attention of the sheriff, with whom they have business.  It's only later that they reveal that as bounty hunters they are themselves working for the US court system, and so therefore seek to talk to the US marshal.@@@@@@(spoiler) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1beG9Y6I9c&t=77s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1beG9Y6I9c&t=77s)",

When the plane crashes, you see it's their responsibility to hold onto them. When one gets away, you see it's their job to track the fugitive down.@@@@@@You see that they're in charge of apprehending the fugitive and the local police assist them where needed. In the first movie \"The Fugitive\", the local police think the fugitive killed a cop and they interfere with the Marshal saying they're the ones going to get him (to kill him for revenge). Depending on how shitty the police actually are in Chicago, I can't imagine real cops watching the movie like that scene. It makes them appear highly unprofessional and bloodthirsty for revenge. But at least later they are able to call off the chopper that's trying to shoot an unarmed guy on the roof (but mainly to keep from accidentally shooting the U.S. Marshal chasing him up there.) Maybe a Chicago cop can correct me if I'm wrong, but the director seemed to go out of his way to make them appear incompetent.@@@@@@This movie basically has #1, #2 , #4, and possibly #5 from the top comment.

For the most part prisons in the US are built on the idea that criminals must suffer to pay for their crimes (this is why they're sometimes called penitentiaries, because you're supposed to do penitence while you're there). This was exacerbated in the 80s and 90s when Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton were fearmongering about violent crime and \"superpredators\". It turns out that most of that was about filling prisons with relatively healthy bodies so prisons could sell their labor cheaply, but most people were delighted by the idea that crime could be reduced by putting criminals in appalling conditions... just as long as they could be sure that they wouldn't wind up in prison themselves. @@@@@@You are right that drug abusers need healthcare-based treatment instead of incarceration, but unfortunately a person recieveing healthcare-based treatment for their drug addiction is harder to get to answer phones in a call center for $0.35 an hour.@@@@@@When you look at Norwegian prisons, what they're doing is trying to fight crime with a reformative approach as opposed to penitential. While neither system is particularly good at preventing crime from happening in the first place, at least the reformative system is humane."

Many Americans will disagree with that. Why? Well, to put it bluntly, and this is just the impression I get from talking with people about criminal justice and what kinds of lives they had when they were younger...@@@@@@Many people are, to some extent, just reactionary sociopaths who were treated harshly as children and were trained to be relatively incapable of empathy. As adults, they don't believe in therapy or that most prisoners even *can* be reformed. They tend to feel *the only way you can rehabilitate someone is by punishing them*. Or at least, they feel it's the only affordable and practical way.@@@@@@These kind of people favor excessive, harsh consequences for even the most minor infractions, and they feel prison should be quite unpleasant, otherwise it's being \"soft on crime\" and not creating a sufficient deterrent. Simultaneously, they complain that prisons are currently like 5-star hotels where bad people are routinely coddled on the taxpayers' dime. They're also inclined to feel that anyone who is in prison surely deserves to be there, and that American criminals are worse than other countries' criminals.@@@@@@When half (or more) of the population feels that way, it's difficult to advance any kind of prison reform-minded agenda.@@@@@@Prisons are also increasingly run by private contractors with very little oversight. They're staffed by uneducated, poorly trained bullies whose only way of maintaining control is to try to be more inhumane than the worst of the prisoners they oversee.@@@@@@All that said, American prisons are nowhere near being the worst in the world.

If we assume for a moment that a police office is doing their job in a non-corrupt way, a lot of people might still dislike that officer. If an officer comes to arrest you, you are going to be upset. The fear is that since a lot people will have negative opinions of officers, officers would get sued all the time for all forms of trivial things. If an officer arrests you, and maybe uses force that you believe in unnecessary, you could sue. An officer detains you because you match the description of suspect at large, you could sue. There are so many reasons to sue an officer even if the officer is doing their job in the least negative way possible. Since there is the possibility that police would be sued non-stop, the law gives the officers qualified immunity. This means that people are unable to sue the police for most typical things. Without this protection, police would not be able to do their jobs.@@@@@@This is controversial because it opens the door to abuse. Qualified immunity only applies to situations that are not blatant acts of police abuse. However, how do you determine what is blatant and what is not? Oftentimes, police really push the boundary of what is an acceptable policing practice, but they are still immune to civil suits."

A large asset transfer from like a bank may be flagged for fraud and frozen. Usually with large, unusual transfers you will need a manager to sign off on it and some account types strictly limit what can be transferred at one time. To clear out and close an entire account it may be necessary to be at a bank location rather than just online. But there are much more liquid assets than cash in a bank account. Even if cash is transferred out of the country it can often still be tracked if not retrieved which could lead to the arrest of the perpetrator.

This definitely reduces how successful such a crime would be.@@@@@@In addition, most basic wire transfer services offered by banks also aren't instantaneous. There's usually a period where it can be intercepted.",
                "First, someone needs to decide to commit a crime in the first place. This is a big risk/reward analysis, and typically, most people conclude this sort of robbery isn't worth it; today, there are too many cameras, too much evidence. The criminal is going to get caught, so either the robbery is going to have to be extremely elaborate, or they're desperate, and it's not about the assets.@@@@@@Second, they have to pick a victim. They have to know you're you. They have to know you have enough assets to be worth the effort. Oh, you got $50k in a 401k? If that? Peasant. If it's going to be worth their time, it better be a few million, because if you pull off this heist, it's going to be important to disappear, and that requires some financing.@@@@@@They have to find you. They have to get to you. And they have to get to you in a context where they can control you and get the assets transferred. They have to do so in a timely manner if they have any expectation to not get caught. They have to somehow make sure you don't call for help. They need to figure out how to get away from you - or how to dispose of you, it's own nightmare of problems.@@@@@@But also, a transfer across institutions can take DAYS. The criminal can't just get you to hit \"send\" and then walk off, because you can just call the bank back and cancel the transfer like it never happened. Are they going to hold you hostage for days? Feed you? Toilet you? Keep you alive? Keep you safe? Keep you under control? I mean, how many years in prison do you think most people are going to negotiate with themselves for all the criminal charges they're racking up? Once the transfers go through, how are they going to extract them on the other side?@@@@@@Once they get the assets, now they need the crime to disappear. Not only do they have to scrub their association with the crime, by obscuring their real identity in the first place, and also through the checks and validations of the banking system, they also have to launder the money. Because hey, yesterday you had a part-time job, today you have millions? How do you account for that? And money in the banking system has a paper trail. That's an audit right there, and the IRS and FBI aren't fans of crime, when it ties back to a millionaire that was kidnapped, robbed at gunpoint, and held hostage for days. You can't just take several million out in cash, large sums attract a lot of attention and take days. Several bond instruments come with serial numbers, others like bearer bonds are also shady.@@@@@@In summary, such a crime is a logistical nightmare if you have any serious interest in pulling it off. Most would-be criminals find the logistics insurmountable. You really have to know your target if you're going to attempt a brute force take. More likely are confidence scams, where someone will work you for months or years and get you to give them a large sum, then disappear. Or pettier theft like an ATM robbery, because the cash is untraceable. If they're going to get away with it it's because contact is brief and they're otherwise as forgettable, as their victims are.

Grades are well within the control of the students. It’s one of the few things students do have control over.@@@@@@As for why a school would expel someone over grades, low grades across multiple classes shows that the student is unable or unwilling to put in the work to learn the material. Maybe the student can’t put in the work for reasons out of their control, but if that’s the case, expelling the student forces them to address those reasons instead of allowing them to continue wasting time and money taking classes that they will not pass anyway. Once the problems are dealt with, the student can apply for readmission."

But he was a very smart man, so surely that lends some gravity (no pun intended) to the position, yes?  Well, no.

An appeal is a fallacy if it relies on nothing more than \"this guy knows what he's talking about.\"@@@@@@For a more nuanced Einstein example, he was very much against the implications of Quantum Physics, even going so far as to hypothesize experiments that would have absurd results.  Those results were then shown to actually be true.@@@@@@Even though Einstein was brilliant and well regarded in physics, citing his opinion in the face of the real physical evidence is an appeal to authority, because it places his opinion ahead of actual experimental evidence.@@@@@@Citing is a short hand for \"insert a whole sub-argument here.\"  If that argument stands on its own merits, great.

Collusion is not unknown to legal systems, and unlawful conspiracies with all sorts of motives have occurred.  Initially the jury was established in England to be independent of the king, as the lords writing the document had just won their rebellion and didn't want him to have absolute power over the legal system afterword.  @@@@@@@@@The point is essentially that a jury has no stake in the outcome of a trial, an independence a judge doesn't necessarily possess.  Take elected judges or those seeking increasingly politicized appointments to higher circuits, who have political concerns clouding their decisions. It would be a disaster.  @@@@@@@@@Jury selection process is deeply flawed in many places, but well structured it can prevent systemic abuses.  Juries have immense power, and are isolated from the temptation to use it fairly effectively.  @@@@@@@@@Often you will also see bench trials mentioned, these are often used when no facts are contested or the case is **very** unsympathetic to attempt to remove the possibility of a outraged jury over-convicting, or in civil law to speed the process up substantially (as it can be done mostly through written filings with only brief arguments in court).

                "Let's talk about political philosophy. It's not as scary as it sounds.@@@@@@The people who wrote the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution were real interested in the philosophies of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes (also a few others). Dramatically oversimplifying hundreds of pages of dense theory, let's imagine what \"true freedom\" looks like. Nobody can tell you what to do. Not even if you want to kill someone. This is what's called a \"state of nature\", meaning it's what people are like when there is no government. Anarchy. I like your laptop, I have a gun, so I shoot you and the laptop's mine. Do you like it?@@@@@@Most people don't. It means warlords have all the power and rule by force. We generally don't want to be murdered the moment we gain wealth, and we don't want to spend our lives defending ourselves against warlords.@@@@@@Philosophers at the time used this to point out we form a \"social contract\" with governments. That means we agree that some rights we have in nature are actually bad for society, and we shouldn't be allowed to do them. Murder is one of those rights. So is theft. We give governments the power to enforce this contract. Our hope is that if people see and believe acts like murder are punished, they will be less likely to commit them, and society as a whole will benefit. @@@@@@Freedom of speech is a thorny issue. Do you think false advertising should be legal? Probably not. But isn't advertising a form of speech? We've decided it is, but that it's harmful to society so it should be prohibited. There are a lot of other ways we limit speech like this. It always comes back to someone, somewhere, deciding that allowing the speech would be more harmful to society than restricting it will be. @@@@@@Contempt of court doesn't allow a judge to broadly restrict bad language in a courtroom. Sometimes that's just the way a key witness communicates. Other times the crime being described can't be described without bad language. @@@@@@But sometimes that bad language doesn't need to be used. The judge may believe it's being intended to disrespect the court, influence the jury, or otherwise cause problems with the court proceedings. Thus the judge has the power to demand that a person refrain from using that language again. If they continue to do so, they've ignored an order from the judge and can be held in contempt. @@@@@@This is allowed because:@@@@@@* We think allowing a trial to proceed fairly and without disruption is more important than one individual's right to free speech.@@@* The judge MUST issue a warning before a person can be held in contempt (ignoring some very excessive disruptions.)@@@* In general the punishment for this kind of contempt is you are barred from the courtroom until you agree to comply with the judge, so the person is seen as \"holding the keys\" to their punishment.@@@@@@There are some other forms of contempt that can result in more severe punishments, but you have to do worse things than use coarse language to get charged with them. Those are more for if the court orders you to pay a person damages, you have the money, and you refuse to pay the damages.@@@@@@Anyway, the point is the kind of freedom guaranteed by the Constitution is NOT unlimited freedom. It's a social contract. Your speech can be limited if it can be proven that your speech is more harmful for society than the harm caused by limiting it.",
                "Society is a sort of game, we have rules (laws and precedent) and referees (judges). The referees are expected to understand the rules and instruct both the players and officials how to enforce those rules. Now we as players decided it was a good idea nor to just let the referees decide everything by themselves, so we play a game within a game, we call court. In this gameception the referee sits in a fancy chair while two special players (the defense attorney or defendant counsel and the prosecutor or plaintiff counsel) debate who is correct and who is mistaken. The Referee then decides who has the better evidence and argument, then makes a decision on how the rule will be enforced this time. Of course, court has its own rules separate from the society game in order to solve arguments about the society game with as little fighting as possible. If players don't want to obey the rules of court, you can't resolve the dispute about the society game without fighting. To discourage players from throwing a tantrum in court, we told the referees if players are disrupting the court game, they can be punished. One of they ways players disrupt court is by using upsetting language, words that are aggressive or offensive. In the society we tolerate it because there are non-violent ways of dealing with that language and we are concerned that restricting offensive language makes it easier for players or officials to cheat or abuse the game. However, we tolerate the restriction in court because if players can be disruptive in court, the way of solving arguments breaks down and we eventually have to resort to violence."

As a result there are a number of safeguards and processes to prevent the execution of innocent people.@@@@@@When a person is convicted in a criminal case (in the United States of America) they can go to a higher court, called an \"appeals court,\" through a process called an \"appeal\" and argue that there were legal issues with their conviction. In the United States most States have a \"Superior Court,\" which is where a person would have a trial. Above that most states have an intermediate appeals court, a court between the Superior Court and the Supreme Court, which would hear an appeal initially (there are 9 states which do not have an intermediate appeals court). Above *that* all states have a \"Supreme Court.\" There is also a federal Supreme Court (as well as federal district and appeals courts). If you appeal a case you can keep going to higher courts if those courts decide they want to hear the case. Appeals can take years. For example the Boston Marathon Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was convicted in 2015 but his case, specifically issues regarding the death penalty being imposed (not his entire conviction), is just about to go before the Supreme Court this year.@@@@@@A brief note is that if your experience with the court system is watching Law & Order things will sound slightly strange because in New York the lowest court is called the Supreme Court and the highest court is the Court of Appeals.@@@@@@In cases where the death penalty is imposed many of the appeals are automatic or mandatory. Because of the number of legal groups opposed to the death penalty there are usually legal organizations willing to pursue just about any avenue, which would not always occur in many other cases. Basically you are fighting in court from the moment the death penalty is imposed until the moment of the execution using e every available avenue.@@@@@@In addition a number of states have the death penalty, but don't actually use it. In most cases the governor of the state (or the President in federal cases) makes the final call and is often unwilling to execute people. For example New York had the death penalty, on an off, until 2004 but the last execution was in 1963. From April of 1963 until June of 2020 the Federal Government only executed 3 people, all of them under George W. Bush. There was a period (from roughly 1972 to 1988) where there was not a federal death penalty, but there were no federal executions under George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama even though the federal death penalty existed and there were people on death row. Joe Biden is opposed to the death penalty and has halted executions as well, so it is unlikely we see any federal executions in the next few years."

Rather than rescind the death penalty as the plaintiffs were hoping, they implemented a fast-track execution process."

During the inmate's stay an extensive and expensive investigation is performed to ensure in absolute certainty there is no shade of doubt that this person actually did what they're being executed for.@@@@@@If you want to see what happens when this process is NOT implemented, look into the case of John Christie and Timothy Evans.@@@@@@In Great Britain, in January 1950, Timothy Evans turned himself in to the police, claiming he had accidentally caused the death of his wife by giving her medicine that was supposed to cause a miscarriage - Evans' wife got pregnant again soon after the birth of their daughter and the two could not afford the second child and abortion was illegal at the time. Evans claimed to have initially panicked, hid the body in a nearby sewer, gave his daughter to relatives, and tried to flee the country, but then, overcame with guilt, has turned himself in.@@@@@@Police arrived in the sewer where Evans claimed to have hidden the body and not only didn't find any but realized a single man could not open the hatch to get down, as it took two officers to lift. Pressed Evans admitted to omitting the truth - he wasn't the one who gave his wife the medicine, it was his downstairs neighbour, John Christie. Christia informed Evans of the tragedy and convinced him it would be better if he disappeared for some time so no one connects him to his wife's death. Christie said he will hid the body in the sewers and make his relatives take care of Evans' daughter. Evans was covering him out of gratitude, understanding his wife's death was an accident.@@@@@@Christie denied everything and suggested Evans may have hidden the body in the small garden adjacent to their apartment complex - he has found a part of it where it seems someone uprooted the earth. Quickly digging the cops found bodies of Evans' wife and daughter, both strangled.@@@@@@Pressed again Evans signed a testimony admitting to having murdered his wife and child but later claimed he was forced to do it under threats of violence. In the court, he tried to accuse Christie but as someone who already has changed his testimony multiple times and had a shady past, his word could not stand to the word of respected former police officer Christie was. Evans was found guilty and executed in March of 1950.@@@@@@In 1953 Christie moved out of his apartment. The new tenant immediately began renovating the place. And behind wallpaper in the kitchen found the bodies of three women. After informing the police someone looked into Evans' case and realized they never searched the whole garden, despite reports of dogs finding human bones in it. They never bothered to ask how Evans accessed a garden only Christie had the key to. They never looked into reports of Christie's violent behavior, including an assault on a woman. Digging through the garden revealed more bodies, from before and after Evans' case. Christie was apprehended and among his possessions was a newspaper clip of Evans being found guilty, as if it was something he was proud of.@@@@@@@@@John Christie was put on trial and found guilty of the murder of at least 8 women but the story doesn't end there. His sentencing made people question whenever Evans was not innocent and just framed by Christie. At the time government of Britain was very supportive of the death penalty and argued there is no way such a sentence would be accidentally performed on an innocent person. To avoid losing face the government called not one but two committees that both tried to claim they believe Evans was indeed guilty. Of course, it was a lie as no one would believe two people were living next to each other, killing the same type of victims at the same time and hiding them in the same spot and somehow did not notice each other. Meaning that defending the death penalty caused the spread of corruption among government officials of all levels. the case made a mockery of justice and is seen as one of the reasons why Great Britain abolished the death penalty."

But a long time ago some juries and judges ruled that if someone got hurt on your property, then it was your duty to pay.  Some makes sense.  For example:@@@@@@If you have a tree that has dug up part of your walk way, and you don't take care of it, and a person comes to visit you and trips and hurts themselves, then it makes sense you are liable because you didn't take care of the problem.@@@@@@However, when you apply that to people doing illegal things is where it gets bad, which is why laws were passed to protect that.  Nowadays, in many places, if you are committing a crime you cannot sue to the landowner if you get hurt.@@@@@@Pools are a sticky situation though.  As a pool owner, you have the duty to make sure that it's not just open for any child to walk into and drown.  You need to have some type of safety measure.  That could be a fence.  Or a cover that locks in place.  Etc.  But lets say you have your pool in your back yard, and you have a fence around it, but somehow the child gets in anyway and drowns, you will likely not be found responsible since you took reasonable precautions to keep your pool safe.@@@@@@I was actually watching a court program a while ago about just this.  It was a public pool, that required a key to get into.  No lifeguard on duty.  The pool was locked after dark.  Some teens got into the pool area after dark and went swimming, one of them drown.  The family sued the pool owner saying that they were negligent. They lost.  The owner of the pool had the fence, and the lock, and the lock out at night.  They also had signs up that indicated no life guard, and signs up indicating when the pool was locked (after dark).  The teens jumped the fence to get in (well one of them did) then opened the door for the rest.  So it was determined they were trespassing, and therefore the owner not liable."

At any point in the next 10 years, if the true owner decides to challenge your provisional ownership, the land reverts to them. If, after 10 years, the true owner doesn't challenge your ownership, you can apply to the land register to have your title made absolute. But they need to see evidence that you've occupied the land openly, without challenge. For the whole 10 years. @@@@@@So yes, it's possible to take over someone else's land in Scotland.

My decade-plus in criminal law has never shown me that the absurd sentences given out in the US actually has any real effect on crime reduction or prevention. @@@@@@The really interesting theory is just that the crime increase and crime decrease track as 18 year delayed indicators of what happens when you give an entire population lead poisoning via lead in gasoline.

As you guessed, it can harm the poor more, and that’s a reason many places have reduced bail to more nominal amounts for lesser crimes or even done away with it. In other cases, bail may not be offered or is set at A huge number.@@@@@@While the alleged parade killer was out on $1000 bail for previous arrest, he almost certainly will not be granted bail after what he did this time.",
                "The goal of bail is to make sure someone shows up to court. For any given person accused of a crime they have some level of risk of not showing up.  @@@@@@If they have a low risk of not showing up, maybe the crime is minor, or they have strong reason to believe they won't be found guilty, the penalties for not showing up are not worth it, so they show up.  These kind of people can be allowed to go home until their trial comes.  @@@@@@If they have a high risk of not showing up, for serious crimes, or crimes where they will probably found guilty, you don't want to give them the chance to get away, so you hold them in jail until their trial. This can also be done for people who are judged to be strong potential risk if they are let out, like a potential murder or rapist, maybe someone who has already been found guilty of crimes before and thus likely to commit a crime again.  These too you want to keep in jail.  If found guilty that jail time can be credited as part of whatever punishment they eventually receive.  There are also laws that might limit how long you can keep someone in jail before giving them a trial.@@@@@@But what about the in-between cases?  People who you have some concern about showing up, but maybe not so much concern you want to lock them up?  Or maybe their crimes are non-violent (say embezzlement) so they aren't a risk to society if they wait for their trial at home.  For situations like that, the idea of bail can be applied. @@@@@@Bail is basically an incentive for them to show up.  Its like a security deposit.  If you show up, you get it back, but if you don't you sacrifice it.  Ideally the amount of bail would be set such that the person doesn't want to give it up and therefore shows up to their court date.  Judges can also impose other limitations such as a monitoring device, or seizing someones passports to keep them from fleeing.@@@@@@Unfortunately there are many potential issues with the use of bail.  For one, if its set low enough a person may decide its worth losing to run away.  Or it might be low enough that they can get out when they really shouldn't.  Or a judge may allow bail when they shouldn't because the person is too high a risk (as this case seems to be).  Additionally, as you have guessed and others have raised, it can be discriminatory.  A person with little means might have a low average bail set, but for them its extreme and they can't afford it.  Since that means they stay in jail their situation can get worse, such as losing a job, having kids taken away, etc.  A person who is wealthy might easily be able to pay the fine or have collateral to get a loan to pay it and thus be allowed to remain free.  Even the application of bail can be discriminatory with non-white defendants more likely to have bail imposed for the same level of offenses that a white defendant is not required to pay bail.  This has led to some groups wanting to end or modify the bail system as it is used in the us.@@@@@@Finally, as others have mentioned, paying the money doesn't allow you to get away with the crime (in theory), you still have to show up for court and could be punished.  If you show up you get the money back guilty or innocent.",

This is what bail is. So instead of spending maybe months in jail awaiting trial because the judge things they will flee if released the judge say that they would be comfortable enough if they left 1000 euros to be returned when they show up to trial.

                "Hello! Competitive shooter here.  Let's see what I can do - these won't be every discipline out there, but will cover the bulk:@@@@@@ - Air rifle, air pistol, smallbore rifle, smallbore pistol: you see these in e.g. the Olympics, and they were once popular in high schools all over the country.  A huge number of high schools and colleges have (now mostly unused) shooting ranges in the basement.  The scoring is purely accuracy, usually from standing and using very, very sport-specific rifles/pistols, funny jackets that support your arm, etc.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - High Power: a popular accuracy discipline shooting military-caliber rifles at long distances without optical magnification (using \"iron sights\").@@@@@@@@@@@@ - Trap, skeet, and sporting clays: The shotgun sports, in which you break clay \"pigeons\" (frisbees) with shot from the shotgun, under different conditions.  In trap, the clays are launched from generally in front of you, but you stand in different locations to slightly change the angle they're flying at.  In skeet, they're launched from a \"high house\" and a \"low house\" that are opposed to one another, and you stand at various places to try to break the two clays launched at the same time from the different houses.  In \"Sporting Clays\", the clays are launched from every which way, including ones that go up in the air in an arc, some that roll along the ground (the \"rabbit\"), etc.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - IPSC/\"action pistol\"/USPSA in the US: This was the handgun sport that initially launched tactical-esque shooting sports, following the teachings of Jeff Cooper to try to combine speed, accuracy, and power into a single sport.  Participants shoot at vaguely torso-shaoed targets (although those are being phased out) and steel targets of different types, drawing from the holster and using one of a variety of categories of handguns which range from out-of-the-box unmodified duty pistols to specially-designed \"race guns\".  Importantly, in this sport, the points you accrue through accuracy are divided by the number of seconds it takes you to complete the course (from starting buzzer to last shot), so your ultimate \"score\" is a quotient of points per second, and you are then plotted against other shooters on identical courses nationally.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - IDPA (and similar disciplines) - people training for concealed carry or police work often criticize IPSC/USPSA as having been turned into too much of a \"game\", and so various disciplines such as IDPA have been developed to help keep things more realistic and incentivize better tactics.  For example, in IDPA, you are generally required to only shoot from behind cover rather from out in the open, you are generally required to retain magazines when reloading, etc.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - Practical rifle: like the above two disciplines, but with rifles.  Targets will range from 5-250 yards rather than 2-50 yards, but otherwise you're still competing based on points per second.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - \"Three Gun\": Organized under the USPSA in the US, Three Gun is very much like IPSC, except that in a single course of fire (between the start buzzer and the last shot), you will combine use of your rifle, pistol, and/or shotgun to engage the various targets.  Again, points per second are the metric upon which you're compared.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - Precision rifle: A less formalized discipline, precision rifle is practiced among various unrelated matches that involve shooting at distant targets with rifles.  Targets are typically steel plates, and may range from 100-2000 yards, depending on the match.  Generally these are scored based only on hits, and not against time (but using a par time to keep things moving along reasonably).@@@@@@@@@@@@ - Silhouette: A benchrest discipline using mostly black powder rifles (possibly also .22s?) in which competitors shoot targets on a range with fixed distances, I believe from 100-500 yards (I'm a little unfamiliar with this discipline).  The steel targets are silhouettes of various animals, and fall down upon being hit.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - Cowboy Action: A popular action shooting discipline which recreates Old West aesthetics.   Competitors are judged not only on their speed and accuracy, but also on their costumes.  They often shoot black powder, and typically use either low-power ammunition with soft lead slugs on stylized steel or cardboard targets, or sometimes cartridges loaded with cornmeal used specifically for popping balloons.@@@@@@@@@@@@ - Biathlon: In the winter Olympics, the biathlon is essentially a combination of smallbore rifle and cross-country skiing.  Compatitors ski between shooting positions, and then engage targets with typically .22 rifles.  They famously manage their pulse and respiration in order to ski hard but then shoot accurately.@@@@@@I'm sure I missed some things, but these are the general types of shooting disciplines I'm familiar with.  I've mostly shot IPSC/practical rifle/precision rifle, but they're all fun and challenging in their own ways.@@@@@@I would say that \"tactical sports\" could really be several of these, and it depends how you approach them.  I shoot IPSC with the same equipment I carry concealed every day.  So is it more sport or more training?  It really depends on how you approach it.  Precision rifle has a lot in common with hunting, but also it's pretty different.  Various police and military outfits or training schools will have competitions that resemble IPSC, IDPA, and 3-Gun, but may have proprietary rules to make them as \"tactical\" as possible, or match the sport to their training doctrine."

If you can make $2,000 USD in a day and get a 5% cut, that's $100 USD a day. In India, the average *monthly* wage is 16,000 INR, or $215 USD, so you an see why they're still a thing.@@@@@@As for how they fund these, I mentioned they use laundered money. When you hand over money (which is in the form of gift cards or Bitcoin, which is hard to trace), the scammer goes on to a forum or speaks to an acquaintance or something and says \"I have a $200 Target gift card. Give me $150 and it's yours\" and the exchange is made, allowing the scammer to put more money in to the VOIP account and scam more people.@@@@@@And the sort of people who are scammed, are usually people who aren't savvy enough to look on Google to see if something is a scam or not. If you've ever received a scam email that says \"hello sir give me $1,000 and ill will give u $1,00,000,0,000\" and thought \"ha that's stupid, who would fall for that?\", then you're not the sort of person they're targeting."

                "Guns are old tech, all the core features of modern rifles are over a century old. When a country is looking for a new service rifle, the main considerations are how it fits into their doctrine, how it fits into their logistical system, and how well it works. How well it works is partly a function of design, but it's also got a lot to do with how well it's built. The AK-47 was famous for being rugged and reliable, but Czech built rifles were significantly better than a lot of Russian built rifles because of the quality of work done in their factories and some small variations on the specs. @@@@@@Logistically, you need a weapon _and_ ammunition that your suppliers can provide in large enough numbers to keep your army running. Existing ammunition stockpiles have been enough to prevent the adoption of new rifles on more than one occasion. Furthermore, adapting an existing rifle to a new cartridge can take nearly as much engineering work as building one from scratch, so stealing a rifle and adopting it to your local calibre might not be a work saver.@@@@@@Doctrinally, different countries focus on different features. The US is notorious for over-emphasizing accuracy. The Soviets focused on simplicity and ruggedness in a lot of their decisions because they depended on a conscript army for a lot of their work. A lot of design choices were made based on those preferences, so it wouldn't make sense for one nation to adopt the other nation's weapon.@@@@@@And then there's the fact that the vast majority of countries _don't_ develop their own weapons and instead buy or license someone else's. The benefit of that is you have a vast range of already proven weapons to choose from, so you can match your logistical, doctrinal, and quality needs without paying for the development costs.",

It's the exact same technology that they use in car mufflers. It doesn't make the weapon silent, it just reduces the noise.@@@@@@The boom of a rifle is distinct. People who have never heard a gunshot in their life won't mistaken it for a backfire or thunder or fireworks. It just doesn't sound the same. Even if they don't know what it was for sure, they'll know what it wasn't.@@@@@@Even a .30-06 is only going to give you an effective range of 1,000 yards. You're not going to be out in the forest shooting into a downtown urban area unopposed. The further out you get, the more inaccurate you become. It takes real, serious skill to shoot accurately at range to hit a small, stationary target that far away, let alone further. Even with expensive optics and training, a skilled civilian can only be expected to hit a target at maybe 2,000-2,500 yards - and be damn proud. So no, someone without experience isn't going to acquire a rifle and suddenly be a mass murderer. At best, they'll spray bullets down a city street and hit things only incidentally.@@@@@@Nevermind if you want to shoot people, you have to go where the people are. That means dense urban areas. You know what's in dense urban areas? Buildings, cars, light posts and street lights, etc. Lots of things to obstruct your shot. Where do you think you can go where you can shoot like fish in a barrel from so far away? From 1,000-2,500 yards away, you'll hear the first couple gunshots, even suppressed, then everyone will scatter - clearing the town square, and you're not going to be curving bullets around corners to hit targets you can't see and don't know if they're even there. Your killing spree is over.@@@@@@If you're going to be killing people like that, you have to be close quarters to ensure the greatest chance you're going to hit your targets at all - and I'll tell you, most people can't even hit a stationary target with a handgun from 25 yards away, let alone if both you and them are moving, especially if you have effectively no training.@@@@@@And it's a real shame for the people down range, but as the shooter, you'd be advertising to everyone your location. You're in a dense area with lots of people, and you're not going to be the only one with a gun. I hear of gang violence where people get away, but a shooter like this? Who was the last one you've heard get away unknown? This is typically a one-way trip for the shooter.@@@@@@You don't hear about shootings like this in the news because they don't happen, because they don't work for the shooter's agenda, because it doesn't work."

The main barrier is a sniper rifle with very good optics is very expensive. While I could easily obtain one, that doesn't mean I could easily pay for it. To give you an idea, I could buy a hunting rifle for $150-$200 if I'm skimping on a lot of quality, but looking at military-grade optics I'm seeing prices that start at $1800 for JUST the scope, and the guns are even more expensive. @@@@@@If you want to murder someone, there are cheaper ways to do it than buying $5,000 worth of guns.@@@@@@Also: that kind of sniper rifle is rare. Not a lot of people buy them. A forensic investigator will figure out pretty quick they're not dealing with a Wal-Mart rifle and if you're a suspect AND you own a fancy sniper rifle, you're going to rocket to the top of the list. @@@@@@Also: it takes a lot of training to use these guns. I've shot at targets with normal rifles out to 400 yards, and even at that distance you have to adjust your aim a little bit. At the kinds of distances you need to evade detection as a sniper, everything from the wind to the humidity can affect how you aim. Ideally, snipers have a \"spotter\" who uses a sophisticated array of sensors and tables to tell the sniper how they should account for all of these factors. @@@@@@Most people who commit acts of violence do so on impulse. So they tend to use what's on hand or easily available. Sniper rifles meet none of those criteria, and don't make it any less likely you'll be caught. If we're talking about a killer who is determined to spend a few thousand dollars and months of effort, it's safer for them to try to engineer something that looks like an accident than it is for them to perform a spectacular shooting with an exotic gun that requires an accomplice and a lot of training."

Of the 14,000 or so murders known to the FBI in 2019 they know the weapon used in about 10,000 cases. Of those 10,000 murders handguns were used in over 6,300 cases. Long guns (rifles, shotguns, and \"other guns\") were used in about 600 murders - roughly as many people were beaten to death with hands and feet.@@@@@@The issue boils down to two things: concealability and ease of transport.@@@@@@Based on what the [FBI knows about the circumstances around the recorded murders](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-11.xls) most (where information was available) were related to arguments, followed by drug related, robbery related, and gang killings.@@@@@@In the case of arguments it's less \"wild west quickdraw\" and more \"storm off, storm back with a weapon\". While it's possible to have a rifle or shotgun in your car most states require it to be visible in a gun rack or locked in the trunk. Having a handgun in the trunk or (usually illegally) in the glove compartment is a lot easier, hence handguns are more likely to be what people storm back with.@@@@@@For the other most common circumstances concealability is important. Someone committing a robbery, selling drugs, or pulling off a gang hit doesn't want to arouse suspicion before or after committing a crime. A pistol can be tucked into a waistband or jacket pocket, a rifle can't. Wearing a baggy hoddie won't get you stopped by the cops, but having a scoped rifle slung over your shoulder absolutely will."

                "It is a great question.... There are several answers.@@@@@@Ability to be concealed. First is that most gun crime is related to gang or other criminal activity. These types of crimes favor small concealable weapons and close range. They are often spur of the moment and you can't carry a long gun around all the time for the one chance you will employ it. But you can carry a handgun.@@@@@@Look at the FBI homicide table: [https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls)@@@@@@13-14K total murders and about 10K from firearms. But 6,368 are from handguns and only 364 from rifles and another 200 from shotguns.@@@@@@Rifles are rarely used in crime and not even the weapon of choice by mass shooters: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/)@@@@@@Handguns are almost double rifles for mass shootings.@@@@@@Next, the further away from your target, the harder it is to hit your target. At 1M you can jerk the trigger and still have a pretty good chance of hitting the target. At 100M that trigger jerk could cause you to miss, at 300M, you have to be pretty darn good to hit a man sized target and any trigger slap is going to make it difficult if not impossible.@@@@@@Then there are factors that you can ignore at short range that you have to account for at long ranges... Elevation and wind. If I fire a weapon level, that projectile will start to drop the second it leaves the barrel... Gravity will start to pull it down. So the bullet will start at say 3 feet above the ground, but will then drop to 2 feet, one foot, and then finally hit the ground. The distance depends on the round, load, and a bunch of other things but the primary factor is the angle of the barrel. As a rough example, for me to hit 200M out I need to have a point of aim (POA) about a foot higher than where I want the bullet to hit (point of impact or POI).  As an example for 300M that might be a theoretical 2 foot shift in POA/POI. Now with a scope, I can dial in that drop out and make POA/POI the same AT THAT RANGE, but that takes an entirely separate set of skills.  I don't have to consider drop when three feet from my target.@@@@@@BTW, once the scope is adjusted for that range, it is only really good at that range.... You can make it good at two ranges, you have the arc of the bullet travel up and when it reaches apogee, it starts to come back down. So if I zero at 300M I will have POA/POI at say 30 feet and 300. POI will be low before 30 feet, then start to rise till apogee, then start dropping and be equal again at 300M then low till it hits the ground.@@@@@@Next we need to be able to adjust for wind for long shots. The wind will move my POA/POI. The higher the wind, the more adjustment I need to make. I don't have to make adjustments for wind at 10 feet.@@@@@@Knowing how to adjust your scope is a science all to itself. But you need to be able to adjust for wind, drop, even temperature and humidity for really long shots. I could take a person with decent fundamentals of marksmanship and have them hit targets out to 1000 feet if I set up the gun. But just hand someone a firearm and expect them to do it? It would be hilarious to watch.@@@@@@TL:DR -  long distance shooting is not as easy as you think. Criminals act impulsively.",
                "\"Sniper\" rifles and silencers do not work the same way in real life that they do in movies/video games.@@@@@@In movies/video games, you line someone up with a scope right in the middle of some crosshairs, pull the trigger, and the bullet goes in the middle of the crosshairs. In real life, the optics are much more complicated - yes they're used for spotting your target, but more important they're used for determining the distance to target. In order to actually hit something or get anywhere close, you need to take into account drop due to gravity over distance and wind.@@@@@@Silencers are more like \"mufflers\" (or their proper term, suppressors) - Yes, they reduce noise some but it's still going to be absolutely loud as hell.",
                "First off, it’s likely down to the fact that people committing gun crimes are likely going to use what is most easily available to them. Hunting rifles and handguns are by far the most prevalent types of gun. That being said, I want to clarify something about what a “sniper” rifle is and is not. There are two important designations for high prediction shooting in the military. A Designated Marksmen is a member of a squad who carries a high precision, longer range scoped rifle compared to the standard assault rifles of their squad-mates. The DM still conducts operations with their squad, but they are there to hit targets that are too far for the standard rifles. A sniper is someone who uses a spotter and a highly specialized precision rifle to engage key targets like you’ve seen in movies. Not all long range rifles with scopes are true sniper rifles. The [Barrett 50 cal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_M82) is a rifle that is often incorrectly called a sniper rifle, despite looking the part.  It might be able to shoot a bullet 1000+ yards, but the rifle and the 50 BMG round aren’t built with enough precision to consistently hit a target that far away. The other thing is that even if you had a state-of-the-art sniper rifle yourself, doesn’t mean you can start hitting targets at super long ranges. The training and knowledge needed to do that effectively you could really only get from the military.",

The .22 long rifle and a subsonic .223 didn't even penetrate the propane tank and the normal .223 went clean through both sides.@@@@@@On top of all that, suppressors are insanely expensive and hard to acquire. A decent suppressor will run around $600-$800 and then there's a $200 tax stamp you have to pay and the process could easily take a whole year to just to acquire one. @@@@@@Other than that, long distance shots are extremely difficult. I'd wager the average person would have difficulty hitting bullseye at 100 yards with the gun already sighted in. Even the average gun enthusiast would have difficulties at 300 yards or greater."

Even if you're on the losing side, you're better off escaping with your life rather than fighting to your death, because the former gives you another opportunity to try again later, and maybe mate with a less contested female or find a less contested watering hole.@@@@@@As such, there is nothing fundamentally contradicting about wanting to hold back in a conflict, and usually both sides are better off if such agreements can be made.@@@@@@In the context of nations, you are better off fighting an economic or cold war than you are fighting a hot war, and you are better off fighting a proxy war than you are fighting a direct war. You are also, for the same reasons, better off fighting a war with rules of engagement than a no-holds-barred war.@@@@@@Obviously, in practice we see all of the above happening *some* amount of the time, but the point is that the concept of war crimes is in no way more ironic than, say, wanting to resolve a conflict via words rather than violence.

(Most obvious example are atrocities carried out on the Eastern front in WW2 - while fighting on the Western front was relatively \"gentlemanly\", the nazis did not shy away from atrocities in the east since they didn't see their eastern opponents as fully human. Likewise, the Soviets dehumanized the Germans as mindless evildoers in response to Nazi atrocities and committed a lot of warcrimes themselves once the tide turned.) Both sides in WW2 also kept stockpiles of chemical weapons around in order to use if the other side did.",

Of course these rules get broken all the time, but if you break them *a lot*, and you lose the war, then the winner is going to prosecute you afterwards.@@@@@@Generally war crimes are actions that don't really make you any more effective in war, but do cause lots of extra suffering.  Chemical warfare is relatively easy to counter -- you just wear gas masks and protective clothing.  But it causes horrible injuries to people who aren't prepared.  It won't win the war for you, because your enemy has a bunch of gas masks in a warehouse somewhere, and he just has to go get them.  So the best you could hope for is a surprise attack where you maim a bunch of soldiers in one battle, and after that everybody has to be prepared for chemical weapons and it never makes a difference again.@@@@@@Compare this to thermobaric weapons (fuel-air bombs).  Some people have tried to claim that these are \"chemical weapons\" because they have chemicals in them.  But the real purpose of it is to make an Earth-shattering kaboom.  It has a definite military use, it makes the user far more effective, and it's basically just a really powerful bomb.

                "As others have said, \"slumlord\" is a derogatory name.  But I'm going to take up for the slumlord a little bit.@@@@@@It works like this.  New construction is expensive, and generally poor people can't afford to live in brand new places unless it gets subsidized somehow.  Over time, yesterday's new construction becomes today's dated building, and tomorrow's run-down place.  As that happens, wealthier renters move to newer, nicer buildings.@@@@@@By that point, the construction loan has been paid off and so you don't have to charge as much in the way of rent.  So as your apartment building or rent house starts looking kind of run-down, you can either spend a bunch of money to fix it back up, or you can rent it to people who need lower rent prices.  People who take the path of the slumlord take the second option.@@@@@@Eventually you own a building that is at the bottom of the area for rent prices.  It's one of the cheapest places around and you're renting to the people who have the least amount of money.  But then there's a problem -- as buildings get older, stuff breaks.  But since you're renting to poor people, they can't pay you very much.  And a lot of times they aren't exactly prompt with their rent payments.  A busted water heater, a leaky roof, or a broken air conditioner might cost way more to fix than the guy is paying you in rent.  So the slumlord puts off fixing it as long as he can because he's hardly making any money on the place as it is.@@@@@@Repairing everything and fixing it up nicer will cost a lot of money, and it'll also justify higher rent prices.  So you can do that, but then you're kicking out the poor people who can't afford anything but the cheapest place.@@@@@@\\--@@@@@@I looked into buying a few piece-of-crap properties in my city.  I was thinking of fixing them up and flipping them.  I looked at Zillow.  \"Oh, here's a house for ten thousand dollars!  All it needs is a new roof... new plumbing... new electrical... oh the inside is half burned down... and it has serious problems with the foundation.  And it's in basically the worst neighborhood in the city.\"@@@@@@I could have done it, but the house would probably require $50K worth of work before it was really habitable.  And houses next door that were livable (but not nice at all) were selling for like $40K.  So fixing up that house would be a money loser, which is why no one had bothered doing it.@@@@@@The slumlord's property is technically livable. but it's probably in a poor area and nobody wants to move into that neighborhood even if he fixes up his building."

This is sometimes done when the alleged crime was committed for personal reasons and isn't supported by the diplomat's country.  On the other hand, allowing diplomats to get away with serious crimes will often cause a diplomatic incident, including breaking of diplomatic relations, withdrawing the ambassador and closing embassies and consulates.@@@@@@There can't be a limit on the crimes covered by immunity because it's so easy for a country to fabricate charges against someone.

So basically, if a top diplomat commits a crime, they can't be arrested without potentially really pissing off another country, possibly starting a war.

They wouldn’t know I was lying about manhatten until either the LA event happened, or they see the manhatten event didnt.",
                "Let's group this into a few categories.@@@@@@* Victim A knows a password to a phone that the torturer is holding in their hand.@@@* Victim B hasn't done anything wrong and the torturer needs to close a murder case quickly.@@@* Victim C was in the general area of a terrorist attack.@@@* Victim D was the terrorist in that attack.@@@@@@Victim A would be tortured to reveal the password to the phone. After some time, he would reveal the password which can be easily verified by the torturer. The first password is incorrect so the torturer escalates the violence with a good chance of A revealing the password later on. The torturer can immediately verify this. Torture in this case works.@@@@@@Victim B hasn't done anything so they will not admit to the murder. However, after enough pain has been inflicted, B will relent and admit to the murder. They will sign papers, give recorded testimony, and do anything to accept the blame so the torture will stop. This includes the case where a conviction leads to death because death is better than torture since it would mean the end of pain. The torture here has resulted in a positive outcome for the torturer who wanted to find the killer but, in reality, it didn't result in truth coming out and an innocent person has now been convicted.@@@@@@Victim C is also innocent and can't admit to anything or share any information about the attack because they don't know. They are subjected to torture where, ultimately, they could make up lies to escape the torture. These lies are hard to verify. For instance, say another terrorist was involved and C is asked about their location. They lead to them to location X and, when raided, there was nobody there. C could say they moved and the torturer could accept this explanation and continue with the torture. Information will be coming out but nothing will be truthful because C is innocent. The torturer once again is \"successful\" at extracting information but the information is absolutely false.@@@@@@Victim D is guilty and will eventually admit to the crime and give out information. They face the same possibilities as C where if they give out location X, the other people could have moved. So it's hard to actually verify the information and the longer you torture someone, the less that information will be reliable *presuming* the information was originally correct. For instance, if you torture someone for a decade, what up to date information are they going to have that could possibly be verified?@@@@@@Does torture work? Torture works for things that are easily verifiable, like account credentials. However, for emergencies, torture doesn't really work. @@@@@@Here's another example. Let's say there's a bomb threat where the bomb will explode in an hour in a market. The terrorist is caught and is tortured to get the location of the bomb. The victim knows that they just need to hold out for an hour until the bomb explodes and the torturer knows this as well. Here's a way for the torturer to not actually harm the victim but get the victim to release the information: they could try to appeal to humanity and mention that the bomb will kill people. They could promise air time or a conversation with a higher up about some injustice. They could also go a bit gray and say that the victim's close friends and family has been arrested and has been spread out throughout the market so the bomb will take them out too. That, other than inflicting pain, will likely do a better job getting the correct information than not.@@@@@@As far as long-term incarcerations and torture, it won't get any more information. It's simply the state taking personal revenge on someone, no different than those stories you hear about various monsters locking people up in basement and torturing them for decades. They're no longer there for information, it's just petty revenge that's just conducted by the state. Whether the US or some dictatorship, the methods are more or less the same and so is the reasoning behind them.@@@@@@If you go back to World War II, there was a famous Nazi named [Hanss Scarff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Scharff#Technique) who wasn't a torturer but he did get a lot of information from Allied prisoners and he did it without harming anyone. This is how you should try to get information from people, not waterboarding them like the US or shoving a broom up their ass like Russia, or various other atrocious methods conducted by many other countries.",

                "Well the main reason is the obvious in that u can force a person to not only confess but in some cases actually start to believe false information because physical anguish causes psychological distress that can in extreme cases potentially induce psychosis or a state of delerium. Ironically this happens just as often with psychological torture in absence of bodily harm with things like sleep and sensory deprivation, look up white room torture and sonic torture is one method the US employed where a detainee would be kept in a confined space with no light at all and they would turn a stereo up as high as it could go and play slayers reign in blood on repeat for 24 hrs, then Britney spears oops for 24 hrs and after 3-4 days with not a minute of sleep not seeing an inch in the darkness with songs in a foreign language screaming \"let the bodies hit the floor!\" repeating over and over they would then rip them from the container and try to interrogate but the captives mental state would often be incoherent and unintelligible. The person subject to torture is mentally unfit to fully realize the situation and often be in a semi dreamlike state which could make them admit or remember events and details that were really only just happening in the person's head and not real life. So it's not just that u can cause a person enough pain and distress that they lie to make it stop but the person will begin to actually believe the falsehoods because their subconscious is trying to create an avenue of relief from the torture. @@@@@@Second reason why it doesn't work is simply legitimacy, once the torture is known by the public then the moral high ground and sovereign authority that grants that power the right to detain and imprison someone becomes diminished from a breach in confidence and credibility. Torture is a violation of social contract regardless of the situational context because anyone can understand and relate to pain and suffering and even a victim can understand and have empathy for a person under conditions of torture even if they feel the person deserves it or the method is nessecary in context to the circumstance. Nobody likes torture and no matter how much you suppress feelings of empathy and dehumanizing the subject and justifications you make to legitimize it, the human mind simply is against suffering. Cognitive dissonance is a coping mechanism not a behavioral adaptation mechanism. The inability to empathize with human suffering and segregation of ones consciousness from the human condition/humanity is a pretty much universally recognized mental illness/disorder known as antisocial personality disorder and characteized as being a psychopath or a sociopath. (These characterizations are very broadly applied and loosely defined in our society these days and used to brand unpopular people but antisocial PD is a actual clinical diagnosis that a psychologist would give to a person exhibiting very specific behavioral symptoms) ex. pol pot, green river killer, Ted Bundy, these are all examples of charismatic, popular and well liked people whose individual conscious identity had no mental link with humanity or the society/communities they existed in, and their terrible crimes were carried out because of their dissociation with society and their inability to understand that the people they harmed we're actual individuals who feel and share a common human experience with instead of simply animated objects that they interact with and manipulate. @@@@@@And finally the third reason torture doesn't work is for legal reasons. Any intelligence gained by means of using torture methods or abuse generally won't stand up to any internationally recognized judicial body. Even 3rd world dictatorships need to have a minimal level of legitimacy that without, would become a domestic threat to the countrys sovereignty. If a nation lacks a legit legal system and judicial process then that nation will become known as a failed state which would lead to either a foreign government using military force to come in and secure that nation or a domestic group organizing a coup or challenge to take over government powers. If the government cannot enforce rule of law that is observed and followed by its citizens due to a lack of legitimacy, it means the ruling power has lost its power that grants it the right to be in charge. And yes torture happens in every corner of the globe under every form of government from communist to democratic nations. However evidence, statements and testimony gained by use of torture is rarely used in criminal prosecutions by judicial bodies because those judicial bodies will harm the nation by allowing evidence obtained under duress to be used as official court findings. So torture is commonly used to obtain information and that information can then be used to collect evidence, but if it becomes common knowledge that evidence obtained under duress is being directly used to convict people then international scrutiny will increase, which leads to pressure from outside governments to reform or replace state institutions or leadership, which if not adhered to leads to economic sanctions and restrictions, trade embargos and tariffs meant to punish and discourage international trade, leading to shortages of food and resources and surpluses of domestic resources that cannot be sold thru international markets, causing gdp to crash and currency exchange valuation to drop and that's how a nation with ample territory and healthy stable population and resources to exploit turns into an ostracized blacklisted semi failed state on the brink of imploding like north Korea or Venezuela. Neither of those nations are in their current state simply because of the practice of torture and human rights abuses, however those practices and abuses did lead to the delegitimization of state institutions which contributed to the decline of those countries. ( To be fair most western powers kinda fell in line with the US standard foreign policy of total intolerance, hostile relations and discriminatory political and diplomatic treatment of any socialist/communist government during the last century, which has had a significant and undeniable causal effect on the prosperity of any communist nation that's still around today, but thats far outside the scope of the topic)@@@@@@I didn't even realize how deep I was going into this thread until now. But yah that's pretty much my multilateral take on why torture is an ineffective and self harmful tool for a nation to employ. I kinda just wanted to highlight the underlying circumstances and aspects of torture that aren't as obvious and are tangibly a bit more abstract but contribute to the fundamental reasons/shortcomings of the practice that are obscured when the argument is distilled down to simply torture is wrong and it's bad if you use it. And it's also important to point out that my positions on the subject are fairly generalized, and exceptions exist. (As sad and unfortunate as it is, a pragmatic approach is sometimes going to be the right way to think about employing torture methods esp in cases that have urgent and dire national security and public safety consequences, sometimes as horrible as it may be as a leader or person in charge of public safety/defense you may be faced with a situation where harming a few individuals in a barbaric and inhumane practice is the only way to prevent harm from happening to a large group of people, and when public safety and security and maintaining defense of your nation is your responsibility, the moral and ethical considerations may have to be dismissed in order to save lives.) And under no circumstances do I condone or advocate any form of torture, however it's irrational to believe that a situation couldn't possibly manifest where torture has to be an option on the table when realistically considering the unpredictable and chaotic qualities that are inherent to human nature and society.",
                "Torture works if you know what answer you want, regardless of what the truth is. For instance, if you really want a woman to admit she's a witch, you are totally gonna get her to admit it through torture. But if you don't already know the answer you're looking for then you have no way of knowing if the torture is working. I feel like the thing you're probably tripping up on is \"the torturer can easily verify an answer\" cause there are probably not many easily verifiable answers in these scenarios. You might imagine the situation is usually that there's some hardened terrorist defiantly refusing to talk, but I'd wager the vast majority of suspects never even admit they're terrorists and the interrogation stalls out at that point. So if every suspect begins by claiming they're not terrorists and then every piece of info they give the torturers is wrong, well you still have no evidence whatsoever that they're terrorists, even if you're \"easily verifying\" their responses",
                "So what you’ve done here is set up a very narrow set of circumstances where it does work—discrete, immediately verifiable piece of data in a situation with no ticking clock.

But the reason we say it doesn’t work is that that set of circumstances almost never happens, but your logic of that particular circumstance is actively used by defenders of torture as evidence that it works in general. @@@@@@Torture isn’t used for those circumstances because it almost never happens. Instead, torture is used for confessions (you can get people to confess to anything under torture), and for more vague answers like names and locations and plans and structures, which torture doesn’t work for.",

They're after specific information. That means they often ask leading questions that lure the torture victim into giving the answer that is obviously desired, regardless of whether it was true. \"*you weren't acting alone were you*?\", \"*you're a homosexual, aren't you?* *Admit it*!\"@@@@@@Finally, torture is immoral and immoral interrogators often care little for the truth. A case closed with an innocent conviction is still a closed case. If you got a hunch and you want to raid, all you need is an excuse. Torturing people into saying what you want them to say is an easy way to get what you want. That's not really how we want interrogators to behave.@@@@@@Ultimately, if you torture someone badly enough they'll start to make up sins just to try and give you anything to get you to stop. The victims might even believe the imaginary sins they conjured up."

But this is much harder to prove because they intentionally used vague language in their speeches and they can argue that they were being misinterpreted and they did not mean for people to actually commit treason. So the investigators needs to find out how much they knew and what they were thinking and they need to find indisputable evidence of this which will hold up in the court of law.

And we generally do not punish innocent people unless there is an important reason for it. People are not arrested and put in jail if we can avoid it because they are considered innocent until the trial verdict. Some of the terrorists have been proven to be flight risks or to show signs to continue their rain of terror, and these have been put in jail.

                "Separation between church and state comes from the 1st Amendment’s “Establishment Clause”, which says “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”. This has been interpreted to include “state action” as well (e.g., school prayer). Under current law, the Lemon test from the case *Lemon v. Kurtzman* is the binding rule for determining whether such a law or state action is prohibited under the first amendment’s Establishment Clause. This test says that for a law to be considered constitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the law must (1) have a legitimate secular purpose, (2) not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion, and (3) not result in an excessive entanglement of government and religion.@@@@@@So applied to your question, the first argument would be that merely referencing a religious point in an argument in a government proceeding is neither a state action or a law since the state never actually took any action. Second, if I were representing that defendant, I would argue that the *primary* effect of my argument neither advanced or inhibited a particular religion. Third, I would argue that even if it did, the argument was nearly sufficient to constitute “excessive entanglement of government and religion”. I’m sure I could come up with other arguments based around immunity, but I think the other arguments are a better teaching tool for your current question.@@@@@@As a side note, I’m a lawyer and strong believer in the separation of church and state and a big supporter of the FFRF (Freedom From Religion Foundation) and lawyers like Andrew Seidel. I highly recommend looking into them if you’re genuinely curious about this area of the law as Andrew’s book on the topic, called [The Founding Myth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1454933275/), is excellent.",

To make this make sense, you have to remember the that they had just fought a war against England, a country in which the king was also the head of the Church of England. Jefferson felt that such an intertwining of social and religious interests could not sustain a free society. In the end, if the Church had influence over the government then what prevented it from growing the state on the backs of other religions or from taking steps to remain the dominant religion, thus influencing a persons choice in religious exercise.  He felt that the United States should not also have a Church of the United States, whether by law or practice, in which the President or other elected officials held religious office. @@@@@@This was never meant to mean that a duly elected official could not act inline with his religious beliefs.

                "The key thing that gets overlooked for Occam's razor are that the two theories need equal explanatory power. Too often, people go \"Theory A has less parts. Therefore, it's simpler, and Occam's razor says to choose it.\" @@@@@@A good example would be the flat Earth. It's true that a ball of fire circling above a flat disk would cause some of the changes we see throughout the year as seasons. However, the globe model explains that as well as disappearing over the horizon, night and day, precession of equinoxes, retrograde motion of planets, etc without adding anything to the model. For the flat Earth to explain all the additional stuff it needs to pile on so many additional changes to how physics work that it ends up with far more assumptions and it's taken to be the worse model.@@@@@@Occam's razor isn't a base property of reason or anything though and can't override observation. In the above example, it didn't prove the flat Earth wrong. It just said the globe model was better and more likely to be true. If the first rockets came back with pictures of the Earth being flat and evidence of all the wacky physics to make it work, then we'd have to say it's flat no matter how elegantly simple the globe model is. Naturally, that didn't happen and we got the pictures of a round Earth we expected."

                "During the BLM protests last year, Kyle Rittenhouse, a 15 year old kid from (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong) Minnesota, convinced his mother to drive him across state lines to Kenosha, WI, with an AR-15, ostensibly to \"protect property\" at the protests.@@@@@@It is unclear what happened between then and the video we have of the incident on trial, but what we do know is he wound up shooting three protestors, killing two of them. The video shows him being run off, arguably being menaced, by the protestors, and though this was not caught on camera, the guy who survived being shot has admitted in court to pointing his own gun at him...@@@@@@After Kyle started shooting. You know, when he himself would have a good argument for shooting in self defense. That's what a concealed carry permit is ostensibly for.@@@@@@After the shootings, we have video of Kenosha police patting him on the back and letting him walk away. He was only arrested after public outcry.@@@@@@So now we get to the trial. The whole thing has been a circus because the alt-right (fascists, basically) latched onto the event and used it to justify all the rest of their barbarism. \"See, here's the *urban thugs* we need to defend ourselves from!\" And the like.@@@@@@And the problem is, if you remove all the context from the situation (as the trial has done), it does look like Kyle has a good case for self defense in the moment. He was being chased by a crowd of people of ill intent who could have hurt him, of that there is no doubt. But because of the way self defense laws are written in this country, it's still considered defense even if you deliberately put yourself into a situation where you might need defending. Which he very clearly did.@@@@@@I tend to think of the circus as just a circus and take the larger view, though. What happened before the moment where a 15 year old kid armed with a submachine gun opened fire on a crowd of people chasing him? What could have been done to prevent this, and why is the trial only focusing on that moment and none of the ones before? Make no mistake, this was no accident. This was *allowed* to happen by a system incapable of, or perhaps entirely unwilling to, prevent it. It is not an isolated tragedy, but a consequence of larger tragedies happening behind the scene.@@@@@@So Kyle is probably getting off scott free on this one. I would be entirely unsurprised if he winds up in court again some day for much the same reason, and on thinner pretenses than this time. But nothing is going to change to prevent this from happening in the future. Because frankly? The people with the power to change it like the way things are."

                "Answer:@@@@@@Keep in mind this is coming from someone without any formal legal background. This is a write up with facts from the trial. @@@@@@Rittenhouse is a 17-year-old dude from Illinois. I forget what city, but it is quite close to the IL-WI border. He's worked in Kenosha, he has family and friends who live in Kenosha. I believe he said he gave money to an older friend of his (Dominic Black) to buy an AR rifle. This firearm never left the state of Wisconsin and was only ever possessed by Rittenhouse when Black was also present. On the 25th, Rittenhouse was given the rifle by Black.@@@@@@Rittenhouse was not an EMT, however was an EMT cadet with his local fire department and had some basic EMT and medical training. He and several friends went to Kenosha essentially to look after the community after seeing the destruction the night before due to riots occurring because of the Jacob Blake shooting. An owner of a used car lot called Car Source asked for protection (from people he knew and ultimately became Rittenhouse and his friends) of his business after seeing every car burned at another location. They agreed and mostly remained around this location.@@@@@@During the day, Rittenhouse got a sling for his rifle so it was attached to his body. This made it so he would not have to set the rifle down or be able to be stolen while he gave someone medical attention or handled a fire extinguisher. Later, a police line essentially moved them from the Car Source. During the night, Rittenhouse and his accomplices put out dumpster fires and gave medical attention to some people with minor injuries.@@@@@@A man, Rosenbaum, was seen being very aggressive towards Rittenhouse and his accomplices. Rosenbaum even made threats at Rittenhouse twice. One time where he said something close to \"if I catch you alone I'll kill you.\" He also yelled (as a white man) \"shoot me n•••a! shoot me n•••a!\" At other similarly armed men. Rosenbaum also becomes angry and aggressive when a dumpster fire is put out. Later, Rittenhouse believes he is walking with a friend, but loses him, making him alone.@@@@@@The first shots: Rittenhouse, alone, finds himself being chased by Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum yells \"fuck you!\" at him and throws what I believe is an empty plastic bag in his direction. A man nearby shoots 2 rounds into the air. Rittenhouse reacts, unsure where they came from, he turns towards Rosenbaum, who is charging Rittenhouse, and Rittenhouse points his rifle at Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum does not stop. Rittenhouse runs again, to find himself somewhat cornered because of some parked cars and other protestors. Rittenhouse stops when cornered and turns around, once turned around, Rosenbaum lunges at Rittenhouse, grabbing for his rifle. Rittenhouse fires 4 rounds very quickly one after another. These rounds killed Rosenbaum. You may hear that Rosenbaum was shot in the back. Although true, this is misleading. This round goes into his back entering his body closer to his head and the bullet goes down his body as if he was shot from above. This shot goes into his back this way because Rosenbaum is horizontal as he lunges at Rittenhouse and his body is lower than the rifle when this bullet is shot. I hope that makes sense. Rittenhouse stays for a brief second, and calls his friend, Black, for a few seconds to tell him he shot someone because he had to. His call was cut short when a mob begin to chase him while threatening him and throwing things at him. Of course, Rittenhouse runs away. Rittenhouse begins running towards the police line to turn himself in.@@@@@@After running down the street followed by a mob of angry, aggressive, and threatening demonstrators, Rittenhouse trips and falls due to being lightheaded from a combination of running and being struck in the head by a concrete rock. When having fallen down, an unknown man kicks Rittenhouse in the face. Rittenhouse fires 2 shots at him as he is being kicked, both miss, this man runs away.@@@@@@Very shortly after, Rittenhouse is struck in the back of the neck/upper back with a skateboard by a man named Huber. Huber sort of runs over Rittenhouse's prone body after this, while also grabbing for Rittenhouse's rifle. Rittenhouse fires a round into his chest as Huber is on top of him, proving fatal for Huber.@@@@@@Simultaneously, another man, Grosskreutz is running after Rittenhouse as well. Grosskreutz also has an illegally possessed handgun in his hand. Grosskreutz stops advancing towards Rittenhouse (once he is around 3-4 feet away) because of Rittenhouse's shot at Huber. This causes Grosskreutz to stop and put his hands up, still keeping his handgun in his hand. Rittenhouse sees him quickly after shooting Huber and points his rifle at Grosskreutz, which is also why Grosskreutz put his hands up. However, I believe (based on video) that since Grosskreutz stops and puts his hands up, Rittenhouse begins to slightly lower his rifle. Grosskreutz testified that Rittenhosue \"reracked\" (also known as rechambering) the rifle at this time. Rittenhouse disputed this in court and I believe video evidence shows that this never happened. Once Rittenhouse sort of slightly lowers his rifle, Grosskreutz (to his own admission and testimony) lunges at Rittenhouse and points his handgun at Rittenhouse's head. Rittenhouse is quick enough to shoot Grosskreutz before Grosskreutz is able to advance any further. He hits Grosskreutz's bicep, damaging his arm severely. Grosskreutz runs away seeking medical attention and lives to tell the story. For this shooting, I want to emphasize (because this is pretty key) that Grosskreutz admitted in his testimony that Rittenhouse did not shoot him until he lunged at Rittenhouse, dropped his arms, and pointed his handgun at Rittenhouse.@@@@@@Rittenhouse gets up and advances towards the police, putting his hands up when he approaches trying to turn himself in. The officer (who is in his squad car) who is being approached by Rittenhouse, orders Rittenhouse to stay back, pepper sprays Rittenhouse, and tells Rittenhouse to go home. Rittenhouse goes home in Illinois where he explained to his mother what happened. Rittenhouse goes to his local police station to turn himself in, driven by his mother. He arrives at the police station less than an hour after the shooting.@@@@@@The big thing part comes in protecting self defense as this case could cause precedent.",

While this is somewhat faulty logic, since the lawyer is being paid to defend the client, things sound more convincing if they say it than the defendant, who will likely be somewhat emotional. @@@@@@For example: a lawyer might say something like \"my client did not kill his neighbor, Joe Smith, on the night of march 3. We have a solid alibi and witnesses who will testify to his presence at Jim's Diner at the time the crime was committed.\" The defendant, telling the same story but being upset after the opposing counsel gave their opening statement accusing him of murder, might say something like, \"I didn't kill him! I swear I didn't kill him! I was just eating dinner with my girlfriend, she'll tell you so, just ask her! And other people saw me there, ask them! I told you, I couldn't have killed him.\"  @@@@@@One sounds a little bit like excuses that a guilty person could say just as plausibly as an innocent one, while the lawyer's statement sounds much more professional.",
                ">relying on someone else to argue on your behalf.@@@@@@Importantly, we're talking about arguing *legally* on your behalf. In court, you don't just make an impassioned speech stating your case and hope the jury/judge believes you. It's more like presenting a research paper: you have to lay out the relevant laws, cite previous examples (aka legal precedent) from past cases, and craft meticulous logically-sound arguments.@@@@@@In that scenario, someone who has a formal education in arguing on people's behalf - and then made a career of arguing on people's behalf every day for their livelihood - is probably going to do it better than you will on your first try.@@@@@@A good lawyer can bring up things like: \"but in the XY case from Texas in 1974, this law being used against my client was found to not apply in this same context\". How the heck are you going to know about that if you're representing yourself? Lawyers have access to resources and know how to use them from their lawyer training. You googling for relevant case law examples isn't going to be as good.@@@@@@Plus what others have said about knowing what to do/not do / how to act in court is important. It has been proven that judges give more guilty verdicts in the last bit of time before their lunch - so how the judge is feeling absolutely can affect the case and therefore the rest of your life. A lawyer to prevent you being dumb (even accidentally) can make a difference. Just shut up and do what they tell you.@@@@@@Remaining objective and unemotional is important too. In a court case, both sides are examining the exact law, its phrasing, its grammar, its past history of usage, and determining how to apply it to your case. The process is methodical and rigorous; there's no place for emotion or subjectivity. If you're defending yourself and get emotional, everything you say gets less rational and your position gets weaker and weaker. An impartial lawyer to law out a factual case is way more persuasive to a judge than you raising your voice or crying or something."

In the episode, we @@@@@@In the episode, we see the character Holden recording himself explaining exactly what he is about to do and why right before he begins his killing spree. He murdered because he was angry he didn't have a girlfriend so his targets were women he deemed to be sluts because they were sexually active but didn't give him attention and sexually active men out of jealousy that they were getting sex while he wasn't and he considered himself to be far above them intellectually. As far as his parents go, IIRC there was a scene where his mother was insisting that he wasn't a bad guy but she had done all she could to get him any help he needed, sort of trying to make excuses for him while his step-father was the one being open with SVU about how his step son had always been. @@@@@@In the real life event, the parents Elliot Rodger had done literally everything they could to get their son help, even after their divorce. His parents were in contact with his therapist, and after Rodger emailed his manifesto and posted his video on YouTube about all the people he planned to kill, it was his Therapist who called Rodger's mother immediately after seeing those materials. His mother then immediately called his father and separately they took off from L.A. on their way to Santa Barbara, both calling the Isla Vista police while they were on their way, hoping to stop him. @@@@@@Now, if SVU had put up a card saying that the episode was inspired by true events, that would have put them at risk of being sued by his parents, his grandfather, the Isla Vista police or any others connected to the case for anything that didn't implicitly happen in real life. @@@@@@If one of the victims was cast, named and dressed to look like one of Rodger's actual victims, the family of that victim could sue the network if they didn't specifically ask for permission to use the victim's name and likeness. They could sue if the show had in any way written the character in a negative light like if they had implied any of the girls were *teases* or somehow at fault for being targeted. @@@@@@There have been plenty of episodes that were very obviously pulled from the headlines; one based on Larry Nassar, one based on Epstein,  and [plenty of others]( https://screenrant.com/law-order-svu-episodes-based-on-real-life-cases/) but Law and Order (any of the installments) aren't laying out a documentary on the cases, just a fictitious television show. @@@The disclaimer that none of the episodes are based on real people or cases protects the network from any litigation for details being changed, words put into victims **AND/OR** the accused or convicted."

In those countries, it is a normal part of the democratic process and part of the peaceful transfer of power.@@@@@@There are lots of major differences between a parliamentary republic and a presidential republic, such as the following (although this is just a generalization, different countries have different laws and political norms, although I'll be focusing on the difference between the US and Westminster countries like the UK and Canada).@@@@@@1. A prime minister is not usually elected directly by the people. Instead, whichever party has the most seats in parliament forms a governing coalition, and they nominate one of their sitting MPs to be PM, e.g. Boris Johnson is MP for the constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. In a presidential system it is not unusual for the presidency and the legislature to be controlled by different parties, but in a parliamentary system this is impossible.@@@@@@2. In parliamentary systems there are usually more than two parties (even if two parties dominate, e.g. in the UK the largest two parties hold 86% of seats) and it is not uncommon for the party with the most seats not to have a majority. In this case they must form a governing coalition by inviting smaller parties to join their government, usually by giving their members cabinet positions. If they can't get enough other parties to join their coalition to get a majority, another party might be given the mandate to form a government. Sometimes a minority coalition is allowed to form a government, but it means that they won't be able to pass any legislation without some opposition support. Meanwhile in the US, it is sometimes said that the two dominant parties are themselves more like coalitions, with something of an ideological spectrum within them.@@@@@@3. In parliamentary systems elections do not necessarily have to be held regularly (although in many cases there are constitutional rules which say they must be held at least once in X years). The governing coalition can usually call new elections whenever they want. The legislature can also usually call a vote of no confidence, which if it passes will require the government to resign and call new elections. In the US, elections are held on a specific schedule, and presidential elections are always held exactly every four years. Even if the president dies, there's no way to move the date up. Prime Ministers also do not typically have term limits, and can theoretically remain in office as long as their party holds a legislative majority. Presidents almost always have well-defined term limits.@@@@@@That's the basics, but there's a lot more."

Mostly this happens by two or more parties forming a coalition.@@@@@@It also means that if at any point in the term that majority falls apart and enough people no longer support the current government they can vote to kick the governmnt out. Usually this is called a vote of no confidence or similar. the exact mechanics vary from system to system.@@@@@@In some system the current government can only be voted out if there is a replacement that has the support of a majority in other it is enough if a majority doesn't support the current candidate. sometimes it means that the parliament itself has to be reelected.@@@@@@At some point if the current parliament can't agree on a government no matter what the head of state may decide to call for new elections in hopes of getting a parliament that can do abetter job.@@@@@@Sometimes the current head of government can call for a new parliamentary election to, if they think it would help them.@@@@@@There is usually some sort of balance of power between the parliament, the government and its head and the head of state, where the head of state is the one who formally dissolves the government or parliaments.

Genetically speaking, the difference between 2 skin colors is wayy smaller than the genetic difference between any 2 individuals.  So the science says that color is nearly irrelevant in terms of our differences and similarities except only as related to melanin and absorbing vitamin D. There is no use for it other than designating someone as being in a certain group because of their color. But in modern society the groups we form are not based on race. The groups are based on a hundred different reasons, so why is race or color seen as an important descriptor?- habitual ingroup outgroup dynamics i.e. racism. For the skeptics, think about it this way- would you say a phrase like- \"According to statistics, 90 percent of wall street crime involving massive scale theft is committed by people who don't absorb vitamin D as well as some, and they have a less than 1% chance of being convicted\". No, you wouldn't because its irrelevant unless you're trying to associate a trait or behavior with a skin color- which they're NOT associated with skin color. In your example of crime- some crime is correlated with socioeconomic conditions. I.E if you're poor you are more likely to do crime because you need to eat etc. Some crime like wage theft and wall street corruption is associated with greed. Neither has anything to do with race. However, how those 2 different categories of crime are punished or not is a whole different can of worms. @@@Race is a human construct that is not useful except in making people \"other\" than yourself -That is the foundation of racism and from there is rooted the fear of the other, and once people are fearful a whole other boatload of issues can present. That being said, it should be acceptable to ask or discuss a persons Ethnic heritage as that is a respectful and meaningful category that is not skin color. I also don't find it offensive to describe a persons physical appearance. I know that might seem hypocritical but you just have to monitor the context and ask yourself if it is really relevant or are you codifying a negative thing as being linked to skin color- because the negative or positive thing is NOT associated with skin color.

There are legal consequences to this, but they take time and often must be pursued by the plaintiff even further. Which takes more time and money to pursue through the courts.@@@@@@Another issue is appeals. Just because a verdict is rendered initially doesn't mean the defendant has to immediately pay up. They can appeal the decision, which like above, takes more time and money on the plaintiff's part to pursue. The appeals court can overturn the initial decision or reduce the awarded amount."

                "This is complicated because it varies from state to state. I'm in this current situation.@@@@@@The debtor can get a judgment to collect the amount and garnish wages, subject to limitations. Generally, the maximum amount is 25% of the person's gross pay. Some states have a means test, for example, 25% or whatever a person makes over minimum wage in a 40-hour work week, whichever is less. The one exception to the 25% rule is child support. In the case of child support, they can garnish, depending on the state up to ***60%*** of the person's gross wages. The courts DO NOT mess around with that anymore.@@@@@@If the person owing the money cannot pay and fails the means test (for example, earning minimum wage for 40 hours), that person becomes what is known as judgment proof. Judgment proof simply means that the debtor can still try to collect, but good luck because no money will be given.@@@@@@If worse comes to worse, the person can declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy laws can vary from state to state but in California for example the law is that you're allowed to keep one car, a house if you own it and $25,000 in assets. The assets are considered auction value. If they took it and sold it for whatever someone would pay for it, then that cannot exceed $25,000 in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.@@@@@@A Chapter 13 bankruptcy, on the other hand, is a little different. A chapter 13 bankruptcy was created to keep  cheats from hoarding millions of dollars in assets and then declaring bankruptcy and not paying for it. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the court mandates that 25% of all the debt the creditor owes must be paid over 60 months with 0% interest. Again the percentages and time frames can vary. @@@@@@For anyone making less than $47,000 a year (as of 2016, inflation has increased this amount) a Chapter 7 bankruptcy basically allows you to walk away with clean hands from your screw-up. There is one exception and I will get into that. Was the reason for the debt intentional (for instance, a sexual harassment verdict?). If the court rules it was intentional, it cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy. If it's unintentional (such as you racked up $70,000 in credit card debt over time) then it's totally dischargeable.   @@@@@@@@@There are other exceptions that can't be discharged (such as student loans) but this is solely focusing on your example. Any sort of intentional tort is not dischargeable. @@@@@@Source: I studied finance and have a Master's Degree.

Bankruptcy may not be the best option for either of them, if they proceed with bankruptcy they will get a chunk of money faster, or they can arrange a payment schedule that will ultimately lead to the defendant not losing their assets and the prosecutor getting more money over time. @@@@@@Theres a few ways that it can be resolved.

                "There are many ways to collect a judgment. The most common include taking money from bank accounts, taking part of someone’s salary, and sending sheriffs to their home to seize and sell property.@@@@@@A judgment is valid for a certain amount of time. I know NJ used to be 20 years (when I did debt collection work about 15 years ago). You could ask a judge to extend it another 20.  If that person ever got an inheritance, better job, or won the lottery, you can get to all that money. @@@@@@The reality is lots of judgments go unpaid. Even with net assets of 100k, it’s hard to lose everything to a judgment. If you want to try to force someone to sell their house, you are not the first to get paid- the mortgage holder is, then everyone else that has a judgment against that guy, then you. So that’s probably where someone’s main assets are, and forcing a sale gets you nothing. @@@@@@Bank accounts are a good hit, but you have to find the bank the guy uses and hope he has all his money in there. Some money you can’t touch, like social security and disability. So even if you find a bank account, that’s not 100%.@@@@@@Wage garnishment works up to a certain %. If the person that owes you money is already being garnished, say for child support, you get nothing. A persons salary can only be garnished up to a certain %. I don’t remember how much, but it was under 20%. So if the person that owes you makes 50k/year, you can get around 10k a year that way. If they get a new job, you have to find out, serve them, and start the garnishment all over again. @@@@@@If the person owns property and collects rent, you can collect that rent. Good luck getting a tenant to pay you and not their landlord. Yes, you are in the right, but they don’t know that and you better bet the landlord is gonna tell them to pay him.@@@@@@Sheriffs auctions often have the stuff seized to pay debts. Clothes, tvs, computers, furniture, cars, tools, jewellery- you can have it all taken and sold to pay you  off. People really hate when the cops come into their house and make a list of their shit. It’s a big motivator to get them to pay you, but if they don’t have it, the term is “you can’t draw blood from a stone.”",

                "Once the creditor has taken all of the debtor's property it can legally take (as a society we've decided that it's not a good idea to let creditors take the clothes off your back or force you to live in a box down by the river, so states have enacted exemption laws to protect certain assets from creditors) then the judgment just stays there until the statute of limitations on the judgment expires, the debtor dies, or the debtor files for bankruptcy. Before any of those, if the debtor obtains any non-exempt assets the creditor can try to have them seized to satisfy the judgment. If the debtor dies then the debt becomes a claim against the debtor's estate, and will either be paid from the estate or not. At that point the creditor can't pursue the debtor anymore. If the statute of limitations runs out, then the creditor can no longer enforce the judgment against the debtor, although many states provide ways the statute of limitations can be extended or renewed, potentially indefinitely. Finally, if the debtor files bankruptcy the judgment's treatment depends on two things: whether the judgment is secured by property and what the judgment was for. If the judgment is secured by property (most often by becoming a lien on real property [land] the debtor owns, but also, depending on the state's laws and procedures, if the creditor has had the debtor's personal property [not-land] to satisfy the judgment but hasn't received the funds from the property's sale yet) then to the extent there's value in the property for the creditor after other claims against the property are paid (if the judgment is a lien on $200,000 worth of real property but there's a prior mortgage of $250,000 then there's no value in the property for the judgment creditor) then the judgment lien survives against the property. If the judgment lien isn't fully secured by property then the question turns to the reason for the judgment. If the judgment was for certain types of debts (e.g. fraud, willful and malicious injury, family-law debts) then the debt is non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy, either automatically or after the creditor makes a request and the court grants it. Regardless of all of these, in the bankruptcy the judgment will be receive payment in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code's payment scheme, and if at the end the judgment hasn't been paid, then to the extent the judgment is neither secured by property nor non-dischargeable it will be discharged, and the creditor will not be able to collect from the debtor on account of that judgment."

So, we use precedent to ensure that things don't change too drastically when new people are making the decisions. @@@@@@Imagine a new supreme court justice gets appointed and decides that the constitution of the US doesn't have separation of church and state anymore. This change would cause many problems and leave people wondering if it would just change again when another supreme court justice comes in. This is not good or stable to have the future unknown. We would prefer if the decisions made now we're going to apply to the future, so we know what to expect. That's why it's such a big deal when decisions get overturned.

That could take decades, if it happens at all). When a court fills in one of these blanks, we call it a “precedent”. @@@@@@Now, one of the driving principles of the law is that it should be the same for everybody (we can argue about whether that’s actually true, but in principle, it should be). When a court sets a precedent, that precedent should apply to all the other courts too, at least within that jurisdiction. It wouldn’t really be fair if two people get into nearly identical circumstances, but only one of them gets to go free.

The courts have the responsibility of dealing with those cases and doing their best to apply the spirit of the law to cases not covered by the letter of it.@@@@@@It is equally difficult to go back and amend existing law each time one of these novel cases is decided.  Congress would spend all of their time just adding in edge cases, which is as time consuming as it is unnecessary.  @@@@@@Instead we use case law and precedent to deal with those edge cases.  Once a judge has made a ruling, other judges respect that ruling as the accepted way to handle that particular edge case.  If it is a peer ruling the judge isn't bound by it and can decide differently, but most try to respect the ruling for the sake of consistency; as others mentioned,  people need to be able to reasonably predict if their behavior is going to be legal/illegal, so a specific ruling to that effect has to be respected as guidance for that action.",

That's been interpreted in different ways at different times -- for example, in the 1960s and 1970s stations would broadcast opposing views after an opinion piece, under the \"Fairness Doctrine\". @@@@@@So regulating what can be broadcast, and at what hours, is just part of managing this public resource.@@@@@@When I was a kid certain \"mature\" themes and language could only be on the air after 10 pm, when kids were likely to be in bed, for example.

But with a second life sentence it is much harder to fight both of them and you are probably never going to get out.

If/when you quit, they have to cash that out for you - and no company likes liabilities on the balance sheet or having to pay money to employees that just quit/got fired.@@@@@@Unlimited PTO **doesn't** accrue a liability.  Since you don't _earn_ a fixed amount of PTO per period, there is nothing they have to pay out to you when you leave.  It can reduce payroll related liabilities by hundreds of thousands of dollars.@@@@@@---@@@@@@Now, you ask why people don't just take a ton of vacation.  Well, they still have to do their work at the end of the day, and US business culture rewards workaholics.  If you don't get your work done, you'll get fired - unlimited PTO or not.@@@@@@With a fixed amount of PTO, you have an anchor point of how much you should take every given year - if you earn 3 weeks, you expect that you'll take 2-3 weeks off because that is what you earn and everyone else takes about that same amount of time off.  With unlimited, **there is no anchor point** and many folks [end up taking less](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/4-lessons-about-unlimited-vacation.aspx) PTO than they did before.  It becomes a race to the bottom, with employees jockeying to show how little time off they will take.@@@@@@So, from a company perspective it is all upside - employees take less time off, there is no PTO liability, and it is a great recruiting tool for candidates.  In reality, unlimited PTO is terrible for the employee.  If you are ever given a choice, opt for accrued PTO every time.@@@@@@---@@@@@@_Source:  Worked as a Management Consultant for many years and helped deploy several 'unlimited vacation' programs to companies.

The software tagged itself in the audio meta-data and that wasn't removed prior to distribution. Eventually someone noticed. I don't recall if anything came of it.@@@@@@And that's usually how it's done. Lots of data has meta-data embedded in it, and if the software and license information is a part of that data, then there's your smoking gun. The easiest thing to do, then, if you're trying to commit a crime, is strip that information out. But you have to know its there, and you have to know how to find it and remove it.@@@@@@Otherwise, it gets harder to tell. Speaking abstractly, sometimes programs that produce or modify data can leave tell-tale patterns in the data due to the algorithms used, if the algorithm is unique to that program. This is very mission-impossible shit, but it has been demonstrated before that software can leave unintentional fingerprints and that positively identify the software used. Now, regarding the licensing of that software, that's a different story. Can you tie the file to a person, a computer, a time, and correlate that with licensing provisions?

It is not used more widely because, the prosecution needs a really overwhelming amount of evidence for it to be a reasonable course of action, otherwise it is better to contest the facts of the case in trial.@@@@@@This is not something the defendant just does, but something that would be offered as part of a plea bargain after discovery."

                "Because Alford pleas are usually used in the context of a plea bargain. In exchange for the plea by the defendant, the prosecution will agree to drop or lessen some of the charges against the defendant.@@@@@@In most cases, the prosecution has no incentive to accept an Alford plea as part of such a deal. If the prosecution has a strong case, or simply is able to pile on a bunch of charges that the defendant cannot or does not want to all defend against in court, then they won't settle for anything less than a full-on guilty-plea.@@@@@@If the prosecution's case is relatively weak, then the defendant will want to fight the charges in the hope of being found not guilty (at least on some counts). So then there's no plea bargain at all.@@@@@@Alford pleas only make sense in a select few cases that are in between these scenarios. Somewhat disturbingly, a common use case will be if the defendant knows they are ~~guilty~~ innocent, but they also recognize that there is a lot of evidence that suggests their guilt, and no other suspects. E.g. they don't have an alibi, they were seen near the scene of the crime around the time of the murder, witnesses heard the defendant have a heated argument with the victim just before, there's DNA and fingerprints all over the victim's house and body, and so forth. Typically an innocent person will fight a murder charge, but in some extreme cases like that they may feel forced to enter an Alford plea. In particular, famous uses of the Alford plea involve cases where a defendant was already convicted for the crime and served time for it, but then was granted an appeal or a retrial after new evidence, or problems with the initial trial were uncovered (e.g. if it was found that the defendant's lawyer failed to summon a key witness to support the defendant's innocence). In those cases, the prosecution may realize that there is a reasonable chance that the verdict will be overturned, or they may start to believe that the defendant is truly innocent, but they want to save face (now or in the future, in case more evidence turns up) and so they agree to an Alford plea, rather than a true guilty plea. The defendant on the other hand knows that they were already convicted once and that this could happen again, and they are already in prison so they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by entering an Alford plea in exchange for their freedom.@@@@@@(Edit: innocent, not guilty...kinda crucial)"

                "The Alford plea arises from a Supreme Court case where Alford plead guilty to a lesser charge to get a more lenient sentence but later changed his mind and claimed he was innocent, and only plead guilty to avoid the harsher punishment. The Supreme Court ruled that since Alford was informed by his lawyers of the consequences of accepting the lesser charge, he could choose the lesser charge and face those punishments, even while claiming he was innocent.@@@@@@The importance of Alford case is that the Supreme Court approved the idea of a supposedly innocent person taking a lesser charge, assuming there was enough evidence against them, to get a lesser punishment. Essentially, the court was approving the most extreme types of plea bargaining: a supposedly innocent person accepting lesser punishment for a crime they didn't commit.@@@@@@That said, a plea bargain is an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor. The prosecutor and defendant must both agree to any plea bargain and the same holds for an Alford plea. However, most prosecutors will not offer an Alford plea because it looks bad: \"Hey! We're punishing an innocent person!\" So, Alford pleas are generally pretty rare.",

Effectively it's a way for a defendant to receive the benefits of an early plea (lesser sentence, lesser charge) without formally admitting guilt.@@@@@@Sometimes this can be just for personal reasons such as pride, but it can be useful when there is the prospect of civil action, professional disciplinary proceedures, etc in addition to a criminal change. @@@@@@E.g. a grossly culpably negligent surgeon kills his patient on the operating table. They might be facing manslaughter-based criminal charges, but they would almost certainly also be sued by the patient's family, as well as facing strong formal disciplinary action from their relevant medical board. Pleading 'guilty' to the criminal charge would effectively mean the civil suit and disciplinary hearing was automatically lost. An Alford plea would allow the surgeon to maintain an official position of 'not guilty' to contest the civil and disciplinary charges.",

Just like with sub-prime mortgages in the 2008 recession, lenders aren't free from blame in this situation. Someone who needs money for what many consider a basic right such as education or healthcare is going to sign more or less whatever terms you put ahead of them. Just look at people who take out payday loans when they're pretty explicitly just scamming you out of money. The blame doesn't just fall on the debtor, it also falls on those who offered the loans and the government that allowed these unfair practices.@@@@@@3. Is the debtor an \"adult individual with agency who is expected to make the distinction between the reasonable and the unreasonable?\". We're talking about 17 or 18 year old kids here. Many of these kids have never experienced debt before, with the vast majority of them living with their parents and having all of their expenses catered for.

Let’s just say that it’s a very political matter, and both that state and a lot of other states really really want to have that law on the books.  So the Alabama “no abortions unless 12 doctors have signed off as saying it’s medically necessary” law gets struck down, and so does the California “the only guns you can have are muskets made in the 17th century” law.  The Supreme Court says they’re both too restrictive.@@@@@@So what happens next?  The states involved really want those laws, even though the Supreme Court says they can’t have them.  So Alabama will go back and pass another law that now says you need 11 doctors to sign off on the abortion, and California will pass a law allowing guns made as recently as 1852.  “See?  It’s legal now,” they say.  “We’ve complied with the court’s order and made it easier.”  And then the process starts all over again.@@@@@@Normally a case will begin in a lower court.  Somebody will sue over the new law, and they will say that the Supreme Court’s previous decision affects this new law too.  A judge somewhere will review it and decide whether the new law should be overturned or not.  People can then appeal that decision.  Not every judge is unbiased, and despite what you might think, they have rooting interests and aren’t always that good at hiding it.@@@@@@I’ve seen courts bend over backwards to try to find some tiny distinguishing characteristic that lets them say a Supreme Court ruling doesn’t apply.

                "Well, its pretty common around the world actually - here in Canada we have provincial laws and federal laws. Although in both cases (Canada, US) there is a clear distinction of responsibilities between what kinds of laws the federal government can legislate vs. what the states can legislate; also, both constitutions lay out rules for who's laws take precedent if there is overlap. @@@@@@In both cases, the states and provinces started off as distinct, somewhat independent colonies of Britain and France. Within reason, they were allowed to form their own legislatures and impose self laws that matched their respective beliefs that could - and did - differ significantly from colony to colony.  For example the Puritan founders of Massachusets might have different viewpoints on things from the Quakers of Pennsylvania. Allowing the individual states to maintain the majority of their legislative self-determination (vs. overbearing federal government) was a key concession in obtaining their membership in the union during all the Continental Congresses. @@@@@@The Provinces of Ontario and Quebec were granted provincial legislatures mostly as a carrot to keep then from looking sympathetically south of the border at what those Americans were doing (you know, going and becoming a separate country). @@@@@@But, in general, the federal government gets to have jurisdiction over laws that affect business and trade between states, anything to do with other countries, and anything involving money. The states get to retain jurisdiction over \"moral\" issues - which are gonna be personal, and change according to demographics - like whether abortion should be allowed or not, and that goes all the way back to the ethnic makeup of the original founders of each colony or state. For example, in Utah, polygamy is allowed (or it was until recently I think) because the founding Mormans thought it was ok.@@@@@@I think the distinction between North America and say Europe, in that perhaps European countries don't have such independent state or provincial legislatures or laws is because they're older and more culturally and ethnically uniform. Like, yes, Im sure northern Germans might look at Bavarians and go \"ugh. they're so redneck\" and vice versa, but fundamentally they're all German; pretty consistent legal, moral and ethical outlooks. Meanwhile, an average Alabaman might have wildly different views on teenage pregnancy or abortion rights from a New Yorker. An Albertan feels very differently about fossil fuels and climate change than I do in Ontario. @@@300 years from now after cultural migration and amalgamation has had a chance to work, there might be a more \"uniform\" American attitude, and most state laws will be more consistent. But for now, strong independent states rights remains a pretty significant remnant of American founding.",

Concurrent sentences all start on day 1 on imprisonment. Consective sentences are served back to back. Charge 1 will start on day 1 and run its time. Only when Charge 1's sentence is complete does Charge 2's (and 3 and 4...) sentence begin. @@@@@@So what does this mean for life sentences? Wouldn't multiple life sentences have to run consecutive? Life sentences aren't necessarily to the end of one's natural life. In most US states, \"life\" is a conditional sentence. Sometimes \"life\" is really an indefinite sentence with an eligibility for parole in a set amount of years. Some states have an option for life with no possibility of parole, sometimes called \"natural life\". In the first case is where consecutive sentences matter. If eligibility for parole on \"life\" comes after 40 years, then the consecutive life sentences adds another 40 years before being considered. @@@@@@Consecutive and concurrent aren't just reserved for life sentences.

                "There are two major reasons:@@@@@@1) If the prosecution were allowed to use illegally obtained evidence, it would incentivice the police to break the law more often, and basically harass the civilians. That goes for vigilantes as well. Basically, we don't want vigilantes so we don't encourage them.@@@@@@2) Many of the rules for how to obtain evidence are in place to make it harder for the prosecution to fake evidence. For example, the police can't enter a home without either a warrant or the express permission of the resident. That way, the suspect has some level of control over what the police do. It is still possible for police to fake evidence and unfortunately it happens all the time, but not as much as it could do.",
                "The reason is that the laws are intended to keep the society functioning, not necessarily to punish criminals at all costs. This means that the state should be discouraged from acting in a manner that hurts innocent people even if it results in less crimes being solved. @@@@@@For example, use of torture will greatly assist police in solving crimes. And I am not just talking about confessions (which are unreliable since innocent people would also confess under torture): torture would compel criminals to provide police with evidence of their crimes, proving guilt beyond doubt. However, allowing torture would result in innocent people getting tortured. Even worse, allowing torture would allow state actors to attack political opponents and with outright financial extortion: threat of investigation alone will compel innocent people to submit to state actor's will and/or offer bribes. See Inquisition for details.@@@@@@Same principles apply to other means of illegally obtaining evidence.@@@@@@&#x200B;@@@@@@Also, evidence bcomes inadmissible as a result of the state actor committing inappropriate actions to obtain it. So, if someone else commits illegal act, the evidence is not necessarily inadmissible.@@@@@@For example, there have been cases when burglars found child porn during commission of a crime and then gave a tip to police. This is a perfectly admissible evidence and pedophiles have been convicted that way. Now, if it was discovered that police bribed the burglar, then evidence would become inadmissible.",
                "I only know about the US - and how it's supposed to work at that (not how it actually works in practice: laws vary a lot from place to place).@@@@@@...@@@@@@The first thing to understand is what is called \"chain of custody\" - which is basically \"who had this thing\". One of the ways to get evidence thrown out of court or to get a jury to doubt it is to show a break in the chain of custody, meaning that someone could have tampered with the evidence. For example, with your blood-stained t-shirt, the defense is going to claim that you planted the t-shirt in the room; possibly even claiming you're the killer and are just trying to frame the person. This can even get police-obtained evidence thrown out: if you can show that it was out of police custody for long enough, that evidence can become worthless.@@@@@@And there are major court cases that have been won and lost on this. Computer files that got changed after the computer was confiscated; lab samples that weren't sent by verified mail; \"drugs\" that were left out of sight long enough that someone could have switched what was in them, and the defendant claims it was something else (herbs like oregano rather that marijuana; baking soda instead of cocaine, etc.); and so on.@@@@@@...@@@@@@A second thing is the area covered by the Fourth Amendment in the US - and there are similar laws in many democracies. In this area, in the US, if the government or someone acting on behalf of the government searches another person, or that person's house, papers, or effects (bags, boxes, etc.) without a legal reason to search; all evidence obtained by the search can not be used in a criminal case - and if it is used, the defendant can call that out \"on appeal\" (asking another, higher-level, court to review the trial) and either get another trial without that evidence, or get the charges dismissed entirely. A \"legal reason\" either means that the government agent either believed that there was something in that moment that the search would uncover that would not be there later (and a key part of that is \"that would not be there later\"), or they gave evidence to a judge and obtained a warrant (legal permission) to search.@@@@@@In your case, since you don't have a warrant, the police would be hard-pressed to accept your evidence for a criminal trial - especially because you'd have to admit you broke the law. If you had a reason to be there, and found the shirt; you could then call the police and give them a reason to enter - but even that might be an issue if it's your friend.@@@@@@...@@@@@@As for why these rules exist:@@@@@@The government is a lot more powerful than individuals. Before these rules were in place - and even with these rules in place (see some of COINTELPRO's actions against Martin Luther King Jr, Vietnam War protestors, and the feminist movement; among others) - governments would lie about evidence they found, make up evidence, plant evidence, etc.: whatever it took to get a jury to say that the person did the thing the government said they did.@@@@@@To make that abuse of the system harder, rules were put in place to make things harder for the government to go after whoever they wanted. The founders of the United States thought that this was important enough that five out of the first ten amendments to the US Constitution were about the court system: the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments."

Pot is a plant, and modern agribusiness can produce ginormous amounts of plant with extremely high quality and consistency.  It's one thing for a Mexican pot cartel to compete with a criminal pot enterprise operating in secret; that's relatively fair \"criminal vs criminal\" competition.

This philosophy changed over time, to the points now where the courts do accept federal bills against substances. @@@@@@Back in the early 20th century, the courts interpreted the Constitution differently. The Constitution provides enumerated right of Congress. This list essentially says what the federal government has control of. It is implied that what is not listed as an enumerated right is not controlled by the federal government, but the states instead. In the early 20th century, the courts generally agreed that nothing in the enumerated rights allowed the federal government to control the sale and consumption of any particular substance. This meant that the courts would have deemed a federal ban on alcohol as unconstitutional. States could individually ban alcohol (many did) but the federal government could not. In order to make banning alcohol a constitutional thing to do, they had to change the Constitution to explicitly ban alcohol.@@@@@@In modern American law, the courts no longer have the same point of view. One of the enumerated rights of Congress is called the Commerce Clause (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3):@@@@@@> The Congress shall have power to...To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.@@@@@@Nowadays, the courts interpret this clause in a way that allows the federal government to ban a substance because it is a type of commerce. The commerce of narcotics in the USA is illegal. Since a lot of drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, come from abroad, the federal government has the right to stop it. It might seem like drugs that stay within the state should be legal, because then it would not meet the requirement of being \"among the several states.\" However in Gonzales v.

Someone serving concurrent 2-year sentences for burglary and weapons possession should in theory be out of jail in two years.  Someone serving a consecutive sentence for the same thing would in theory be out in four years. @@@@@@Now what people don’t know is that in some areas you get “credit” for every hour you don’t cause trouble in jail. So if you don’t cause trouble for an hour, you get credit for an additional hour of jail time.  So in the previous concurrent example the convict would be out in just one year and in the consecutive example he would be out in two years. @@@@@@How the sentences are handed down is often dictated by state sentencing guidelines. The judge has a series of checks that determine the length of sentence and how it is to be served. If there is a prior criminal past that pushes the sentencing one way and if there is no history then it pushes it the other way. Things like employment, family in the community, job, home ownership, etc. can also play a role in sentencing.  @@@@@@For most serious crimes parole or early release is also possible if a percentage of the sentence has been served (I believe like 75-85%).   So after 8.5 years of a 10-year sentence someone could be eligible for early release.  In particularly heinous crimes, or frequent convictions, the sentences are designed to prevent early release by assigning more years to a sentence and making it a consecutive sentence rather than concurrent.  @@@@@@So a child rapist who accidentally kills their victim might only have gotten convicted for second degree murder, or maybe even just manslaughter.  Those would have significantly fewer years of potential punishment than first degree murder.  So for the rape the guy might only get 5-years and for manslaughter he’d get maybe 10-years. All total he could serve as little as just 5-years (remember he gets an hour of credit for every hour he serves with no trouble) and if the 5 and 10 year sentences are served concurrently then he would be out in no time. @@@@@@By making the sentences consecutive he would serve as little as 7.5 years and as many as 15. @@@@@@But a lot of it has to do with prior criminal history."

However, they must work within the prescribed length of punishment determined in the penal code law. @@@@@@Judges will also take into account such as what the victim and convicted have to say at sentencing, prior history, the convicted person's background, and threat to society.@@@@@@Most important take away is that it's up to the judge and what they feel is proper. Sometimes, it's like you said, \"a punctuation\", to redress the victim. The overall premise of the courts, all lawyers are taught, are about equity, give back what you take: balancing. (Layman's symbol: lady justice). For criminals, it's their time for the crime committed."

A serial killer may be suspected and tried for multiple murders - you want to ensure that they are tried and convicted fully for each one, and not have one botched investigation or unproven crime jeopardise a separate case that is a pretty safe conviction."

        "gold_completion": "You can serve time “concurrently” or “consecutively” for multiple convictions. Someone serving concurrent 2-year sentences for burglary and weapons possession should in theory be out of jail in two years.  Someone serving a consecutive sentence for the same thing would in theory be out in four years. \nNow what people don’t know is that in some areas you get “credit” for every hour you don’t cause trouble in jail. So if you don’t cause trouble for an hour, you get credit for an additional hour of jail time.  So in the previous concurrent example the convict would be out in just one year and in the consecutive example he would be out in two years. \nHow the sentences are handed down is often dictated by state sentencing guidelines. The judge has a series of checks that determine the length of sentence and how it is to be served. If there is a prior criminal past that pushes the sentencing one way and if there is no history then it pushes it the other way. Things like employment, family in the community, job, home ownership, etc. can also play a role in sentencing.  \nFor most serious crimes parole or early release is also possible if a percentage of the sentence has been served (I believe like 75-85%).   So after 8.5 years of a 10-year sentence someone could be eligible for early release.  In particularly heinous crimes, or frequent convictions, the sentences are designed to prevent early release by assigning more years to a sentence and making it a consecutive sentence rather than concurrent.  \nSo a child rapist who accidentally kills their victim might only have gotten convicted for second degree murder, or maybe even just manslaughter.  Those would have significantly fewer years of potential punishment than first degree murder.  So for the rape the guy might only get 5-years and for manslaughter he’d get maybe 10-years. All total he could serve as little as just 5-years (remember he gets an hour of credit for every hour he serves with no trouble) and if the 5 and 10 year sentences are served concurrently then he would be out in no time. \nBy making the sentences consecutive he would serve as little as 7.5 years and as many as 15. \nBut a lot of it has to do with prior criminal history.",

Debates go back and forth, and when it's your turn to speak you can speak for as long as you want.  @@@@@@So if you REALLY don't like the bill being debated, you can filibuster.  That means you go up there, you tell everybody why the bill is bad, and you keep talking, and talking, and talking, and talking....  you don't even have to talk about the bill, you can talk about your life, what you had for lunch, what's a good way to make apple pie, or you can literally read the phone book.  You can stay up there as long as you want (for hours or days even) and nobody can force you to stop until you decide to yield the floor.  The result of course is that the Senate grinds to a halt and nothing gets done until you stop.  @@@@@@The only thing that can stop a filibuster, is the Senate as a whole can vote to end debate on the bill.  But that takes 60 out of 100 Senators to agree that debate should end and the bill should be voted on.  @@@@@@The problem, IMHO, is that to filibuster a bill you need not sit there and talk constantly anymore.  You can simply announce that you are filibustering a bill, and the Senate will move on to other business until either 60/100 votes force the bill to be voted on, or you announce you are no longer filibustering that bill, or the bill is dropped entirely. @@@ Thus you can filibuster a bill indefinitely (for days/weeks/forever) without having to ACTUALLY filibuster.  @@@@@@This means that if one party is united to stop a particular set of bills, they can simply filibuster ALL of them, and the practical result is that it now takes 60 votes to pass a bill instead of 51 because everything gets filibustered.  @@@@@@In practice, the Republican party has used this frequently, especially during the Obama years.  The semi-official Republican agenda was 'stop Obama' so a great many bills that Republicans didn't like were filibustered and didn't pass, even though a majority of both Representatives and Senators were in favor (51/100 would vote to pass the bill, but 60/100 Senators wouldn't vote to end debate / stop the filibuster and allow the bill to be voted on).  @@@@@@That's the controversy now- on one hand the filibuster probably should exist as a last-ditch way to stop really bad bills, but on the other hand perhaps it shouldn't be quite so easy to use, perhaps if you have to actually stand up and talk for 8+hours at a time it'd be used less frequently."

In a non-death penalty case you cannot typically introduce new evidence on appeal.  The only thing your appeal can concern is some error that occurred at trial.  You also only get one (1) appeal.

To keep executions from being “cruel or unusual punishment” which is unconstitutional, there are only a few ways they can be done that is considered humane. Most common nowadays is Lethal Injection, which typically put the person to sleep and then kill them.  But, what happens when you run out of those medications/chemicals?

Or if you kill someone while robbing a bank, you'll get murder time and not robbery time. @@@@@@@@@As other said before me, in other systems, if you kill 10 people, you get 10 life sentences, which makes your sentence 300 years, and if you kill someone during a bank robbery, you get like 40 (30 for murder, 10 for the heist).@@@@@@@@@The longest prison time given to someone was 4000 years, in China, to a serial killer terrorist.

But there's no obvious reason for us to bother.  It's not necessarily the case that anything positive is accomplished by assigning someone a 1000-year sentence instead of a 100-year sentence (though other posters have mentioned a few things to consider: expression of society's outrage, controlling what happens if the criminal is later exonerated or pardoned for some of their crimes, interaction with parole rules, controlling what happens if there's a medical breakthrough and everyone's life expectancies go way up, etc.), but there's no harm in it either, and no reason for us to make the law more complicated than it already is."

(Short explanation there are things that cannot be asked. The commonly known one is the 'rape shield' which prevents the victim's character from being attacked. In addition to this there are different rules for 'my' witness and what I can ask vs what my opponent can ask. Even with this there are 'bait' tactics to trick the opponent into asking something to 'open the door' to me being allowed to ask certain things.) Yes this is very complex and jurors cannot be expected to know this. There is a part of the bar exam dedicated to this one thing for a reason.@@@@@@Fourth, basic order (as opposed to chaos). We know the simple rules. One person speaks at a time, and if more than one person is talking something is wrong. IF the judge starts talking SHUT UP, this is not a debate, we are not having a conversation if the judge opens his mouth everyone else stops talking. (Seriously as much as people want a zealous advocate and everything else the number one rule to every lawyer is candor to the court. Sanctions and everything else can be ordered for a reason)@@@@@@&#x200B;@@@@@@Fifth, your job is to listen and think.

For a vastly oversimplified example, the odds that I share a particular marker with another person is actually very high, but as the number of markers checked increases, those odds decrease dramatically.@@@@@@Different labs and jurisdictions have different limits on the number of markers that they need to test, and some jurisdictions actually have scarily lax standards for how many markers need to be tested to constitute a \"match.\" In some cases. the odds that the DNA is unique to a suspect that are required to convict someone have been as low as 1 in 13  (as in in the case of Charles Richard Smith).@@@@@@ In the case of Chen Long-Qi, he was convicted of rape after DNA evidence matched him to the crime. The problem is that the investigators only tested 17 genetic markers in a sample which included multiple people's DNA and ended up producing a false positive. A later test was performed on 23 markers which totally exonerated him. DNA is a really powerful tool when it's applied correctly, but it's not the magic bullet that a lot of people think it is.@@@@@@[The innocence project](https://innocenceproject.org/overturning-wrongful-convictions-involving-flawed-forensics/) is a great organization that reruns DNA tests at a higher accuracy (in addition to performing DNA testing on other cases) to attempt to clear the names of the wrongfully convicted.

If someone is sent to prison for 10 years, that means that after 10 years the government *has to let them out* and leave them free to do whatever they want, unless the person has been convicted of something else.@@@@@@But just dumping people on the streets after they've spent a decade in prison isn't that great. It tends to put former prisoners in a place where they may feel re-offending is their only option. And that's not good for anyone. Instead we have parole systems.@@@@@@With a parole system, rather than waiting to the end of a sentence to release someone, prisoners are released early - but with restrictions or conditions. That might be \"you have to report to your parole officer once a week\" or \"you have to let us know where you are living\", or \"you have to stay in an approved shelter/hostel for the first few months.\" Ideally a system designed to help the former prisoner integrate back into society, while also letting the authorities keep an eye on them if they fall back into crime. And with the threat that if the person misbehaves or breaks the rules (or commits another crime) they can be brought straight back to prison for the rest of their sentence, without needing a new trial.@@@@@@So a life sentence means just that; the person is under a prison sentence for the rest of their life, and at any time (subject to normal rules on use of government power) they can be brought back into prison. However, parole means they have a chance of redemption; of getting out of prison, and of trying to make a better life for themselves - better for them, better for society.",

When someone gets life in prison they may not always actually stay in prison for the rest of their life. It is possible that through good behavior and other factors that they are ready to be reintroduced into sociaty at some point. And the laws do support this to some degree.

                "In the broadest sense, decriminalization can mean any process that reclassifies a certain behavior so that, either on paper or in practice, it is no longer considered a crime. This includes legalizing the behavior - that's one way to decriminalize it. However, often the term *decriminalized* is used in contrast to *legalized*, to distinguish something that, while technically still against the law, is in practice no longer treated as a crime.@@@@@@One way to decriminalize something is to adopt a policy of non-enforcement. See, in order to get convicted of a crime, you need a prosecutor to charge you with that crime first. Without charges, there can be no conviction. And prosecutors work for the state. So the state can instruct its prosecutors not to prosecute certain offenses. And if prosecutors ain't gonna prosecute, then it also makes sense for law enforcement not to arrest people or write them up for the same charges. Thus, you completely eliminate any enforcement of the law. @@@@@@For instance, in the Netherlands, possession of marijuana is illegal. There is a law that says so. At some point, some of our politicians wanted to change the law to legalize it. Others resisted this, either on principle or because they feared the response of the international community. So they came up with a compromise: keep the law the same, but stop enforcing it. And so these days, in the Netherlands, you will not be arrested or prosecuted for having a certain amount of weed on you or in your house, even though technically it's still illegal.@@@@@@The practical difference is mainly that a policy like this can be very easily changed again, since it doesn't require any laws to change. Any government can just decide to do change the policy. Whereas, if you actually legalized weed, then you would later need to find a majority in parliament again in order to change that law and make it illegal again."

                "The main reasons for suspension (at least in my experience in the UK) is to get the pupil out of the environment that's causing the issue, or if they're a danger to other pupils. Yes that pupil is out of school, but they should always have work set to do at home. The pupil could also be such a distraction in class that the entire class isn't learning anything. It is a bit outdated as a concept, especially since a lot of pupils that are being suspended don't do work inside OR outside of school.",
                "Suspensions are given to students who are so disruptive to class that they prevent other students from learning. They literally have to be removed from the class to allow others to learn. In school suspension will have you go to a different room, or the principal's office and do their work under more direct and strict supervision. Full suspension is removing you from school grounds. It is the step before being kicked out of the school permanently and your parents being forced to find you a different school.@@@@@@You are still responsible for all homework and tests that you miss so your workload is not reduced as you seem to think.",

                "> I have never really understood why would someone be sad/angry about being suspended@@@@@@Typically a suspended student is going to be subject to further consequences from their parents for their misdeeds. A suspended child must have other accommodations made for them since they aren't at school; does a relative need to be contacted to care for them, does a parent need to adjust their work schedule, etc? It is likely to be a big hassle even beyond the expected punishments.@@@@@@> also I have never understood why would school want to suspend let’s say a troublesome student so he misses even more classes. @@@@@@Suspension is supposed to be a last resort. The school cannot deal with the problems the student is creating and so suspends them for the protection of all the other students. It would be ideal if the student in question could attend all their classes, but their behavior prevents that from being workable. Whatever they are doing is too disruptive to allow to continue.@@@@@@So yes, the suspended student's studies will suffer. But everyone else is better off.@@@@@@> I always saw suspension as a free time off from school, you wouldn’t have to get up early and do homework.@@@@@@Presumably this is because your parents weren't doing their job, imposing consequences at home and the discipline required to prevent you from being an ongoing detriment to others. Ensuring that your time suspended wasn't more pleasurable than your time attending school would have been one factor of proper parenting, but the reality is that poor parenting is fairly common."

Basically countries have a connection of other countries where they basically tell each other, “hey if you find this bad guy in your country please return them to me so we can charge them”. The US currently partners with over 100 countries for extradition. For your second question, it really depends on the country. If the country with no extradition captures you then they can decide to send you back or not. Take Edward Snowden for example. He is known as an American whistleblower who exposed some of the United States spying methods on its own citizens. In order to not be jailed he fled out of the United States and is currently residing in Russia. Since the U.S has no extradition policy with Russia, they are not obliged to send him back so he can be charged. It all depends on the country and it’s policies."

Bottom line though, unless otherwise specifically prohibited by local laws (possibly on human rights or asylum seekers etc), no country needs to justify asking a non-citizen to leave their country. Even without a formal extradition treaty, the country might decide that someone is no longer welcome and deport them (although in most circumstances back to the country of their citizenship) Also bear in mind, there is usually some form of \"understanding\" between the judicial and executive government. In many cases, absent a compelling reason, the judicial will give precedence to the executive in cases involving international politics, foreign policy or national security."

In general the wealth increase over time, there is more population, better technology make use more efficient, etc.@@@@@@There is a relation of supply and demand between wealth (that's the demand because the more wealth we have the more we want to trade it away) and currency (that's the supply because you need currency to trade wealth). So if wealth increase overtime and you leave your number of currency stable, the value of that currency will go up. That's deflation and it's bad for the economy on long term. If you add more currency than your wealth increase, the currency value will drop and that's inflation.@@@@@@Basically all countries consider that 2% of inflation is the optimal situation. It's high enough that the risk of going into deflation is low, but it's not too high that it create economic issues. It's also incentivize people to invest their money. Money invested move in the economy, which lead to higher economic growth. @@@@@@That's the issue with gold, you can't control the amount of currency in the economy as well as fiat currency. In the past this wasn't such a big issues, but after the industrial revolution the economies of the world started to grow at an faster and faster rate. The wealth increase is just too high, we never gonna have enough gold to back a currency without constant deflation.@@@@@@Another issues with backing your currency with gold is that gold is useful. Medical and electronical technology use gold a lot. Without counting jewelry and other artistic products. If you use gold to back currency, you increase drastically the demand for gold and increase the price. A lot of products using gold would either vastly increase in price, or have to use a lesser material of replacement.@@@@@@The main advantage of gold was to give confidence to the population in the currency. But don't get it wrong, nothing guarantee your paper money, even if it's backed by gold. If people didn't have confidence in the paper money, they would just refuse to give you back gold in exchange. The government could enforce it if it's on a limited level, just like they do it with business refusing to accept money right now. But the moment it become generalized, backed by gold or not, people will simply stop valuing the paper money and it will be worthless. Gold just provide an illusion that the paper money truly have value. But in both case of gold backed or fiat currency, it's always only the confidence of the population in the currency that give it's value. @@@@@@It's the same for basically anything really. If the vast majority of people start to think that computer is evil and we shouldn't use them, well computer would lose all value. They would barely be worth the value of the material they are made off. And if people stopped using the metal used in those computer, that too would become worthless.

USD 25 !!! If I paid a dude to just come to my place from there, I would have gotten it it if was like USD 500, for the employee costs, oil (costs a lot in Europe), truck usage, insurance, etc. So this means, this USD 500 has to be shared between all the recipients. But is there really enough people ordering from their place to mine, or close, to fill up a truck EVERY HOUR PEOPLE ORDER ? And since delivery has to take less than 24h, including customs who take ages, it's not like they could do a whole Europe tour everytime, so they has to pretty much do my trip and go back !@@@@@@Please help me solve this huge mystery to me.

The larger companies are selling off assets and not putting money into this area, possibly due to shareholder pressure on global warming. Oil/gas exploration and development is expensive, risky and requires payback measured in decades. It is no big surprise companies are not willing to spend money today when profits 20-30 years out are uncertain.  @@@@@@Bringing on less new supply and a future with less demand means current producers are also keen to maintain higher pricing to grow their profits to allow them to invest into non oil gas projects.@@@@@@The problem here is the transition timeline towards greater renewables. Energy demand is still increasing and renewable energy solutions, despite fairly high interest, can barely keep up with the growth of energy demand. So although renewables are growing, it is not making a huge dent as a percentage in the total energy supply needed. @@@@@@On top of that, many major countries (eg UK, Japan and the US) have ceased investing in nuclear power and actively taking nuclear off-line. Two plus decades of non-investment in nuclear results in old plants needing to be refurbished or shutdown and new plants built, but that isn't happening in most markets (except perhaps France). @@@@@@There is also not a lot of interest in building large new coal fired plants (in the rich world) as coal is rapidly becoming cost uncompetitive.@@@@@@This puts more pressure on demand for gas fired plants (the \"cheapest\" and \"cleanest\" of the fossil fuels). However, oil and gas comes as a mix - you get one with the other. So no exploration means neither oil nor gas supply looks to be increasing in the future.@@@@@@In a bleak sense, saving the world from a climate crisis was never going to be cheap or painless. While this might be a temporary price spike, the long term trend will be increasing energy costs t pay for the trillions needed in investment in renewables (hydrogen etc), grid-scale storage and long distance distribution of electricity which will inevitably be needed."

If you could magically add 8 zeros to the end of *every* dollar price/wage/bank balance/etc. it would cause only a minor annoyance. @@@@@@The reason hyperinflation is a problem is because it doesn't work by magic. Not all the numbers are changing at once. The money you have today is worth a very different amount tomorrow. Savings become worthless. Salaries have to be constantly re-negotiated. Everyone needs to be paid daily and spend that money immediately. @@@@@@So fixing hyperinflation is about stopping the growth. This often happens by transitioning the economy to a more stable foreign currency. With or without the participation of the government, everyone starts figuring prices in something other than the old currency. Because this outside currency has an external reference point that keeps its value stable, prices calm down. However, significant damage has still been done. Basically every financial contract in the hyperinflated currency (including basic things like savings accounts) is now moot. @@@@@@After that point, assuming everyone goes back to the hyperinflated currency, it doesn't really matter that it now has a lot more zeroes. New banknotes can be printed to accommodate this (they probably already were). Financial statements are maybe a little harder to read. Everyone eventually starts thinking in terms of the smallest meaningful amount of currency, so if a stick of gum costs 1,000, you could shorten all numbers and add a 'k' to the currency marker.

It is a matter of confidence in the ability of the government - if the citizens and, to an extent, the larger financial community is unable to trust the government, then fixing the issue is nearly impossible. @@@@@@The actual mechanisms is to discontinue the old currency. By the time hyperinflation occurs, the currency is essentially worthless and untrusted (because there will be simply too much of it floating around). Then the tough process begins of issuing new currency (typically pegged to some external currency or currency bucket), capital controls (to mitigate capital flight) and getting the economy to recover. For some countries, they may abandon the idea of a local currency and instead use some other currency (the USD for example) as legal tender.

For example when Yugoslavia broke up in the early 1990s, the currency experienced hyperinflation, and most of the people at the time adopted the German Deutsche Mark for the purpose of actually buying things.@@@@@@When it comes to situations where the denominations of currency involves numbers that are too large to be convenient, this can happen without \"hyperinflation\", but after periods of sustained high inflation.  The usual approach is to introduce a new series of coins and banknotes, sometimes with new names, at a fixed value relative to the old ones.  This has happened in a number of countries over the years.  In 2005, for example, Turkey introduced a new Lira, where 1 new lira = 1,000,000 old lira.  In the same way that countries routinely introduce new sets of banknotes to reduce forgeries and the old ones are steadily removed from circulation and replaced by new ones, the same process can apply, just instead of 1 new = 1 old, a different set of numbers is used.  When this is done, generally countries go for a simple multiple of 10, so you just delete some zeros from the end, as it makes it easy for people to relate old prices to new ones.

                "Tesla's worth so much because people want to buy shares of the company. Strictly, the stock price doesn't reflect the company's capital assets or revenue -- the market capitalization is based on perceived future value.@@@@@@Why do people think Tesla has so much potential? It depends on the investors, but they generally note that Tesla is investing strongly, growing rapidly, the demand for their products and services is stronger (demand outstrips supply), and the company is not only manufacturing electric cars, but a whole electricity and electricity-storage infrastructure that includes battery technologies and supply chains, energy storage, and renewable energy production. Tesla is a potentially disruptive and market-defining integrated multi-industry company. It's not just rapidly growing, but has rather obvious massive future growth potential. In fact, it really doesn't have a serious competitor for the type of company it's shaping up to be.@@@@@@If you look at Tesla as just an electric car company, the price is not justifiable. However, if you take a broader view, it's still probably over-priced but it's at least justifiable."

                "A company is \"worth\" the current selling price of a stock, multiplied by the amount of stocks that exist, since each stock represents that percentage of \"ownership\" of the company. Many things influence the selling price of a stock, including how people perceive how others will perceive it.@@@@@@Explaining beyond that like you're 5 is a bit difficult.@@@@@@Companies that are willing to expand their business to any industry and maintain a perpetual growth model generate extremely high enthusiasm in the market since the potential for upwards growth is uncapped, which is why companies like Amazon and Apple previously had extremely high price to earnings ratios, not unlike TSLA (though in the past few months it has passed those). On top of this, TSLA appears to be experiencing a \"Gamma Squeeze\", where this same stock enthusiasm causes the share price to rise since everyone is buying it, expecting others to continue buying and driving up the price. In isolation, this would lead to a crash, but since the company is capable of selling stock and investing that money into themselves, a high valuation can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, ironically, they have the potential to dominate their sector while growing to others as a result of their high valuation based on people believing they could. And this folds in on itself over and over."

BMW, VW, Ford have decades of past sales still on the road increasing numbers but a VW sold in 2010 or a Ford sold in 2015 has no baring on stock price today.@@@@@@Tesla is viewed as many to be the future of cars, which can grow and become the Ford, VW, etc. of electric cars. They've also changed their business model relative to other car makers -- such as no franchise dealers -- and don't have decades of past workers who are retired with company pensions. And electric cars can be cheaper to build since they have many fewer complex systems compared to internal combustion vehicles. So once Tesla's battery factories are up and running and reduce their costs for their largest component expense, then their already high margins should go even higher, or they can cut costs and sell way more vehicles.@@@@@@And there are also announced moves into high volume/high margin segments like pick-up trucks, semi trucks that could even further boost their sales and profits in coming years. @@@@@@However, the stock has likely gotten ahead of itself and is priced higher than the \"true\" value might be, because of financial considerations like options contract excersing, lack of investor consideration for other car makers catching up with electric vehicles, etc."

Extremely high demand for Tesla stocks based on speculation of future value inflate the market cap. Because so many want to buy and so few want to sell it makes the price look really high. If a large amount of Tesla stock were to be liquidated at once the price would drop heavily, also pushing market cap down.@@@@@@V simple maths explanation: you've got company X with 10 shares, all of those shares are held by the company director (say Musk with Tesla). About 100 people want to buy stocks in company X. The price they're willing to pay for 1 share varies but most want to pay around $10. However 2 buyers (A & B) are willing to go up to $100 because they're convinced of the future value of company X stocks. They start a bidding war and Buyer A pays $100 for 1 stock. You could say the trading price of company X stocks is now $100, with the company having a market cap of $1000 ($100 share price x 10 shares). That's not however the total the market is willing to pay and overestimates the total value of company X. If the director went to sell all stocks they'd maybe get Buyer B to pay over $10 but then would be forced to sell to those only willing to pay $10 as no other demand is there. The maximum value you could generate from selling all 10 stocks is $280 (2x100 + 8x10). This is a considerable difference to what market cap was showing.",

                "In the 21st century there are a lot of theories of valuation of companies and so different companies are valued in different ways for different reasons by different people.@@@@@@The old school manner of figuring out the value of a company was to take its revenue and multiply it by 4x.  You could further multiply if it carries a dividend.  Most really valuable \"blue chips\" in the past were so because they came with a dividend (a quarterly payment to you from profits).@@@@@@Modern theories of valuation are no longer concerned with current revenue.  This is largely due to the success of larger tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple.  As a thought experiment, how much would you be worth today if you bought Amazon in 1997 for $10,000?  Well.... right now you would have $6.7M.@@@@@@If you knew Amazon was going to be as successful as it was... how much money would you be willing to spend to get that kind of money 20 years later?  Well... probably a lot more.@@@@@@And that's where people are standing with Tesla.  They believe that 20 years from now Tesla will be worth $4T-$5T (or maybe even more).  So they're willing to pay a lot more today for what it's worth today because in 20 years time they expect it will turn them into millionaires.@@@@@@The speculation in Tesla is getting more and more ridiculous every year.  Tesla has gone up by the value of every other automaker in the world combined over the last month... because Hertz (a company that is now bankrupt) ordered $1B in Tesla cars.  Eventually the Tesla bubble will bust, people will not be willing to pay \"future prices\" for the stock today forever."

                "Market capitalization is just one very specific, and very narrow, way of estimating the \"worth\" of a company.  If you think about how it's calculated, then it will answer your question for you.@@@@@@Market capitalization for any company, private or public, is based on two things:  how many shares have been issued, and what the share price was the last you checked.@@@@@@When and how you check the share price varies considerably between public and private companies, but it's basically the same concept.  You're going by what \"the market\" says.@@@@@@So if Tesla has issued 1Bn shares, and they are currently trading at, whatever, US$1200 per share, then voilà, there is your \"market cap.\"  There is literally nothing more to it.  It's just a really simple multiplication operation.@@@@@@What you really want to ask is, \"is TSLA really worth $1200/share?\"  TSLA's price/earnings (P/E) ratio is like 400 or something, meaning you'd have to hold a newly-bought share for 400 years to make the price back just on earnings.  So if you calculated based on P/E instead of market cap, you'd get a very different estimate of what Tesla is \"worth,\" and it wouldn't be $1200/share.@@@@@@And if you calculate based on liquid assets, Tesla is only worth a few $Bn -- a tiny fraction of its market value.  If Tesla went under right now, today, and was liquidated by a bankruptcy court, its share value would be its net assets divided by its shares -- so something like $1/share.  Yes that's $1.00.  100 cents.@@@@@@So which do you choose when asking what a company is worth?  There is not necessarily one single right answer, but in general you do want the different ways of measuring worth to roughly agree with one another.  Wild disparities in valuation are red flags.  TSLA is certainly not worth what people are paying for it.  But what is its \"correct\" value?

As a long term tesla investor, I'm beginning to think that Tesla will look like Pac man on the pie chart of auto makers. If you compare the numbers, Tesla will likely be more profitable than Ford and GM by end of this year, despite selling about 1/4 the amount of units. Hertz buying 200k Model 3's at no discount is a huge slap in the face for Ford, when Hertz' CEO is the former CEO of Ford.

                "Explaining something like this can be challenging to a 5 year old. But I'll try.  @@@@@@@@@Tesla is worth what people are willing to pay for it. Many people think it's stock price is too high when they compare it to car companies because they are making a mistake. Tesla is not a car company. It is a battery company that happens to make cars. It is also a company that makes and buys more batteries than any other company on earth. They've started to use the technology from batteries to become an energy provider.  @@@@@@@@@As governments start to try to move away from burning fossil fuels to provide electricity, there are new needs in the energy market that Tesla has started to fill. So electrical companies that keep your lights turned on have a very hard job. They try very hard to keep the amount of power available balanced just right so that you can turn on a light when you walk into a room, but not so much power that it overloads all the electronics in your house. The power needs for these companies change during the day. As people get home in the afternoon after being at work, there's a huge shift. Usually just as people want to go home and turn on their lights and TVs, the sun happens to be going down. This means that all of the solar panels that are on peoples roofs stop providing energy, just when lots of people want to start using more energy at home for the evening. This is typically when companies use what is known as a [peaker plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant). These peaker plants are pretty expensive to run because they turn off and on fairly quickly, but they add a great deal of cost to an electricity company any given day that they're used. Tesla has started to offer giant batteries to electric companies in place of peaker plants. This has [been shown to save](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve) huge amounts of money for the electric companies. So the demand for huge batteries like this has gone up significantly. Because of that and the fact that Tesla has shown that they can provide a solution that is affordable and stabilizes the grid from unexpected issues, people expect them to be able to sell many many more of these.  @@@@@@@@@This is one small example of market disruption that Tesla is getting into. There are other products and services that they're offering that are not feasible for other car companies to compete with.   @@@Tesla has its own insurance company for its cars. And because it can collect massive amounts of information from its cars on how safely its customers drive, it can significantly reduce the cost of insurance to safe drivers.  @@@Tesla is working on a roofing product that would replace high end roof and solar panels systems with it's own system that it claims is much better.@@@@@@Tesla is working on a self-driving platform that currently can help prevent accidents with its cars, but in the future might replace steering wheels completely as the car will drive its self. This would be worth absurd amounts of money if completed and approved to operate by governments.@@@@@@Tesla is very innovative within even the car industry as well. There are many youtube channels that cover this much more in depth, and you're welcome to watch some of them.",
                "Everyone is saying a stock’s value reflects demand for owning a piece of the company and what anyone at any given time is willing to pay for it - that is all correct. But why, you might ask, should anyone think that it’s worth $1,200 a share?@@@@@@What most analysts critical of Tesla miss, is that Tesla is literally years ahead of the competition when it comes to potential full self-driving capabilities. This is because there are thousands of Tesla cars driving around the world, right now, collecting data that feeds into Tesla’s AI software that improves incrementally every time it gets more data (aka a machine learning algorithm). It’s not unreasonable to think in some time, 10-20 years etc., that cars can get so good at driving themselves that they become *legally* safer than human drivers, and perhaps even be required let alone preferred. Elon described this concept on the 1Q21 earnings call.

This can be indicative of an information gap, volatility speculation, or it can be indicative of some investors being irrational.  @@@  @@@Goodwill is an intangible assets that accounts for other market participant's inclination to, for example, preferentially do business with you even over your competitor. @@@This includes both investor goodwill and customer goodwill.  @@@  @@@Tesla's high stock price almost certainly reflects both these things.  @@@@@@- There are certainly individuals investing in Tesla primarily because of a valuation disagreement.  Some think it is a bubble and are betting they can make a profit and get out before it pops: some will be right, others will be wrong - this form of speculation is basically gambling, and the disagreement is largely a reflection of the difference between an aggregate forecast and a individual instance of a bet..  There are also at least a few people who hold an unrealistic expectations of future returns: I've met a couple wild-eyed techno-utopians who think Tesla's first mover advantage is somehow so large they will dwarf all other automakers in the next decade.@@@@@@- There are also people who are deliberately investing in Tesla because they want to own Tesla, in particular.  Part of this is people liking Musk - as much as people dismiss it as a \"cult of personality\" and similar, there is a real and meaningful value to having a public representative of a company that can make people believe in a company's goals.  There is also wanting to own the stock, like the cars, for brand prestige and signaling.  Finally, there are people who want to own it because they see it as a avenue to invest in the idea of electric vehicles: they value the core business proposition Tesla in particular or an electric-only car maker in general offers to the market enough that they are willing to take decreased direct returns on the stock as a result.",

This means that the engineering culture they’ve built allows them to navigate huge manufacturing problems that nobody else can.  That alone is a huge winner.",
                "There are many reasons. It's all about the future, not about today. I hope the below explains some of the reasons.@@@@@@@@@What happens, in 10 years, if Tesla outcompetes all the other companies and either drives them out of business or vastly reduces their size and sales, and Tesla wins most of the transportation industry? All those other manufacturers, with all the resources and capital in the world, have done nothing over the last 10 or 15 years. Why would they be able to compete against Tesla now?@@@@@@You have to realize that in gasoline engines, only about 5% of the energy from the gas burning gets to the area between the pavement and the tire. In electric cars, it's about the exact opposite - about 90% of the energy gets to the tire. So it is massively more efficient. It uses so much less energy. In gas-powered cars, a lot of the energy is wasted on heat - engine, transmission.@@@@@@Gasoline engines are particularly bad in cities. Engines waste an incredible amount of fuel idling at stop lights, and contributes a lot of hydrocarbons to the air for no utility or value at all. Gas engines also do not recover energy from the heat from braking for traffic lights while electric cars do. That's a lot of f-cking wasted energy when taking into account all vehicles in the USA or world.@@@@@@The cost for a \"fill up\" depends on many factors. Right now, where I am at, the price per gallon is $5, so that means a 15 gallon gas tank is $75. To charge an electric car is about $11, but that is using average electric rate - it could be lower to charge a Tesla if always charged at night when rates are lower, for example.@@@@@@You can charge your Tesla through renewable sources like solar, wind, or hydro, but you can't with gas engines, of course.@@@@@@@@@Also, electric cars are by definition high-performance cars. They routinely kick the shit out of supercars, at least for the short run. And *certainly* for the price. [Here is a Bugatti Veryon vs a Tesla](https://youtu.be/0IgiFcVZOuY?t=95). Yes, the Bugatti wins, but not by much, and the Bugatti costs $1.7 million (FYI, the cost to change the tires is $30,000 and actually need to be changed often). The Tesla doesn't cost that much. [Here is a 1000 hp McLaren vs Tesla](https://youtu.be/loUsRGW9z-I?t=647). The McLaren costs $300,000 for this version, and the Tesla smokes it. @@@@@@When you push the accelerator on electric cars, the wheels start turning immediately with full torque - no need to switch through all the gearing on gas cars.@@@@@@Electric cars require a lot less maintenance, because basically they are batteries with wires to the tires (to the generators at the tires). No transmission fluits, coolant, engine oil changes.@@@@@@As more and more Teslas are produced, there will be lower and lower prices as economies of scale kick in.@@@@@@Governments around the world are starting to talk about not allowing gasoline engines at all. For example, California will require all light-duty autonomous vehicles (AV) to emit zero emissions starting in 2030. What are the gasoline powered car companies going to do? California is the largest market for cars.@@@@@@Tesla is also developing semi tractors, too, which will vastly reduce pollution from large truck emissions. @@@@@@Tesla is creating driverless cars. This is huge. With computer driven cars, insurance rates should drop precipitously, because there will be a LOT less accidents, deaths, etc. It won't eliminate them, people may still get killed by computer driven car mistakes, but *overall*, these types of accidents should be a lot fewer. Some have speculated that because of this, insurance will be a lot more predictable because individual driver decisions are taken out of the equation and the computer driven cars will be known by computer code and therefore predicted much better. Some speculate that insurance will come wrapped up in the purchase price of the car, so there's no need to pay insurance. It will be the exact same rate for everyone, because the computers are driving the cars. All this money people pay to insurance companies will go to other things instead. This might be a lot of money for the individual, but taken on a nationwide basis, the effects are massive.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@.@@@@@@There are drawbacks, too, of course. @@@@@@Battery packs need to be replaced, for one. And car batteries are *very* nasty, so where are they going to be dumped when they go bad?@@@@@@Because people will charge them at home, this means that the government (federal and state) won't be getting the gas tax at the gas pump from gas stations. This is a serious issue, as roads need to be constantly repaired. Some states are experimenting with charging cars per mile traveled. In California, the state tax per mile is .51 cents per gallon, and the federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon. Total of 69.4 cents per gallon. So if your car gets 20 mpg, that is a total of .035 cents per mile in taxes that we pay in California.@@@@@@@@@.@@@@@@.@@@@@@There are probably a lot more benefits, but that's all I have time for. So I hope this explains it in a little more detail as to why the stock price might be justified. If Tesla runs all the other car companies out of business, *shouldn't* Tesla's stock price be higher than the others combined? I'm not saying that will happen, but hypothetically, it should be worth more than all the others, IF it runs the other companies out of business 10 years from now.",

That money shows as debt and the government may even pay interest on the debt, but as the 'owner' of the central bank, that interest payment is promptly returned to the government as a dividend. @@@@@@Countries like America are in a unique position when it comes to debt, because as one of the reserve currencies, they borrow in American dollars. Therefore, if they were to pursue a policy of rapid currency devaluation, they're literally reducing the value of the debt they owe.  This is one reason wealthy people HATE the idea of floating currencies.

But prices for certain goods normally do, and the increased prices for staple goods normally hurt the most because they’re things people regularly need but have a harder time paying for (gas, food, etc.). Some industries get hit harder than others like tourism and recreation because people don’t have extra money to spend to do things aside from the necessities to keep their household afloat.

The global crash of 2008 was preceded by a perfect storm of low fuel and food supplies, government bailouts, and loss of investor confidence in banks. @@@@@@Investors lose confidence and claim their shares while there are still shares to claim, banks have no credit and continue to lose out from plummeting stocks. The banks failure leads to bank panic, and everyone runs to withdraw their money. Banks don’t actually hold all of the money as cash, and don’t have enough reserves to payout to every single customer. The continued withdrawal of cash leads to bailouts from other banks, and it’s a domino effect because banks are globally connected and few exist as single entities. Eventually, banks fail and business customers of the bank lose out. When governments provide trillions of dollars to these institutions to prevent a complete global collapse, it has a knock-on effect on trade and commodity prices. @@@@@@Trade slows down significantly because of…various reasons (domestic supply, increased tariffs, redirecting finances) that would take an essay longer than this to explain. Export prices increase to make up for a lower supply (see global food crisis 2007-08, which was a separate but related event) and so basics like food are more expensive to import - this is reflected in the consumer price. @@@@@@Institutions and businesses lay off employees because of financial issues, and unemployment increases - but rising prices mean that the unemployed can’t afford basics and rely on governments aid. Governments are already stretching their money for bailouts, and have to borrow but everyone else is also borrowing. @@@@@@Basically, everything is connected. When one nation experiences a blow (especially one as big as the US), the world feels it. Trade is incredibly important for food supplies, the majority of countries are not self-sufficient and do not produce enough variety of food to feed their population.

When financial institutions stop lending (either because they’re not getting enough money themselves or because they’re afraid to lend to people or companies in certain industries) then businesses have a difficult time expanding and growing so they cut back as well. Then that leads to job and wage cuts. That also leads to decreased stock values. I’m not sure if prices for everything tend to go up. But prices for certain goods normally do, and the increased prices for staple goods normally hurt the most because they’re things people regularly need but have a harder time paying for (gas, food, etc.). Some industries get hit harder than others like tourism and recreation because people don’t have extra money to spend to do things aside from the necessities to keep their household afloat. But other sectors have sinking prices like cars and homes because the market is either flooded or stagnated with excess as less people buy them which also sinks values for companies and for assets like houses that people may have investments in.

                "If you want to skip my explanation, here’s John Oliver with a humorous 30 minute deep dive… https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI@@@@@@Pyramid schemes, or multi-layered marketing, are models where one person “recruits” a few people, and each sale those people makes, the original gets a slice of. Those people cannot make a livable wage without developing their own “downline”, aka, then they get a slice of every sale made by their downline. But guess what, the original guy at the top of the pyramid also gets a slice of those sales. So as people are recruited, the top of the pyramid no longer has to work; the base of the pyramid supports them. @@@@@@Historically, MLMs/pyramid schemes are notorious for bankrupting people or isolating people. They often have a cult-like approach where anyone that doesn’t support you fully is deemed someone you shouldn’t talk to. When the inevitable realization you’ve been scammed comes, you’re alone, and then even the company will shun you. @@@@@@Also, if you look at income disclosures for top MLMs (eg, ItWorks, Herbalife, Optavia), you’ll see that, on average, less than 5% of MLM sellers make a positive income. Less than 1-3% make the 100k/yr that you’re promised in the recruitment pitch. In other words, your odds of success are about as good as surviving glioblastoma. @@@@@@Finally, mathematically, if one person recruits 5 people, those 5 each recruit 5, and those 5 each recruit 5…this can only be repeated around 15 times. So the bulk of your income is from developing a downline, but if you get in after the brand is already fairly popular, the odds of developing that downline decrease significantly. @@@@@@Watch the video! It’s hilarious, but it’s also sad how many fall for there. Id also suggest the antiMLM subreddit for a list of bad companies.",

So, out of these 10cents, 1 cent goes to your employer. @@@@@@This way, you build a pyramid, because the amount of people drastically increases from level to level to cover the base costs. The higher you are in the pyramid, the more people \"you\" have paying for you from the lower levels.@@@@@@The problem is, the amount of people that are willing to join or buy the product is usually way lower than expected. Which normally is good, because less people fall for this. You will never find enough people to cover the costs - at least not with less effort than you would need to put into real work for the same outcome. @@@@@@There are simply not enough people in the world.

We spend way more than everyone else on \"security\" and policing our own children. Some of this may be necessary, but it goes *way* overboard & also generates a school -> prison pipeline. We also, and a lot of my fellow libs/progressives don't like to hear this, spend lots of money on bad teachers who are really hard to fire because of the teacher's unions.@@@@@@2. Our spending on schools is funded in large part by *local* property taxes... so if you're in an area without high property values (i.e. where more poor people live), then schools face a structural under funding. This has a very very big effect across the nation.@@@@@@3. All the above is true & explains how we end up with some schools that are actually underfunded, it's not the true problem. The true problem is that money doesn't solve everything... or at least, money pumped into the school system doesn't solve everything. By far the biggest factor influencing how our students do has nothing to do with schools - it's their homes. For example, the children of high income parents do pretty much exactly the same regardless of the school they go to. This is because they are far more likely to have the time, education, and interest to be heavily involved in their child's education. Ultimately, if we want to improve our schools' outcomes, we need to address the unique level of poverty & inequality we have in the United States. All the funding in the world won't do shit if the kids don't have food on the table at home, their parents aren't there to make sure they do their homework (because they're busting their ass trying to put food on the table), etc.",

Yeah that didn't work. It just made people more encouraged to make sure that bussing didn't work and got repealed on the down low. @@@@@@Then there was the cash grab of school voucher programs.

They want to trade. But there is only 1 dollar. In theory, my father can sell the spoon for 10 cents, but he doesn’t want to. Spoons always costed 1 dollar. @@@@@@So he ask one dollar and sell 1 spoon. No one has another dollar to buy another spoon. So until my father spend the only dollar for one apple, there is no currency to do exchanges. So what do we do? Throw away the 9 spoons because we can’t sell them?@@@@@@The solution is simple, while the items tend to continue to sell for the same price, because that’s what people wants, we can just print more dollars, borrow them to his cousin, so he can buy 10 spoons, then my father gets 10 dollars and can buy 10 apples.@@@@@@During human history, every time the production increased, the value exchanged increased, and to make it possible, more money was printed. This has the side effect of creating inflation. My father day of work is worth 10 dollar, while my grandpa day was worth 1 dollar. So if you want it but manpower, well you have to spend 10 times more than before. But in exchange we have a lot of spoons and apples for everyone.@@@@@@Back to the gold standard: if you tie the dollar to gold, then you can’t print more dollars, you can have only as many dollars as your gold reserve.@@@@@@The gold standard was ok to give a fix value to a currency if we were in 1500 ad, where the economy growth was very little, and the pricing could took forever to change. But in modern times with production doubling every decade, locking the amount of currency in circulation would completely block the trade. It’s called Stagnation.@@@@@@Edited for typo@@@@@@New edit, I forgot the most tricky part:@@@@@@If you have inflation, you gonna but the spoon today, it’s the same price of tomorrow.@@@@@@If you have the gold standard, the one dollar of my grandpa was equal 1 spoon, but if he never spent it, the next generation can buy 10 spoons with it. @@@@@@So... What is the problem here? @@@@@@It’s that NO ONE buy stuff. There is no incentive. If you leave your money in the bank, it will keep growing its spoon value.

Wealth is the demand because the more wealth you have the more you want to trade it. And currency is the supply, because you need currency to trade.@@@@@@So since wealth increase over time (in general), you need a way to keep increasing your amount of currency available in the economy. Today we target to add a bit more currency than the wealth had increase (around 2%). This create around 2% of inflation which for reason I won't get into it viewed as the idea situation for economic growth.@@@@@@If your currency is tied to gold you can't have as much control on how much currency is added to the economy. If you find a lot of gold, you might have too much currency and now you have huge inflation problems. And if you don't produce enough gold for some time then you end up with big deflation. With a currency that isn't link to something physical, it become easier to control the amount of new currency that you add to your economy to balance it.@@@@@@The big advantage of gold (or silver in the past) is that it give confidence to your population into your currency.

For most of human history, we didn't really know well the relationship between currency and wealth and it could sometime bit us in the as.

As we developped technologies, population growth started to skyrockted and so were the economies. If in the past the production of gold could keep up with economic growth to create enough currency, for the past 100 years or so it just wasn't possible.@@@@@@And finally, we found more use to gold than in the past.

Then, governments were like “this bartering thing is pretty hard and we want an income, so how about we require taxes to be paid in something specific? Then everyone needs to have it to pay taxes, and that means they can trade the tax paying item.@@@@@@So nations started using precious metals (other stuff too but mainly metals, minted later on) to pay taxes. You and I got more value out of our trades, because now the cow trader doesn’t need to want my baskets to give me beef, he just needs to want silver so he can pay for other shit. That’s the essential function of all currency, is that it adds value to a transaction, both thru taxes and flexibility. @@@@@@Then people were like fuck this money is heavy and easy to lose, also I’d like to put it in shit like banks. And governments (iirc the United States was one of the first, the continental army way paid in signed playing cards?) Decided to give out notes representing levels of silver or gold, and that went on for a while. @@@@@@Then in the 1900s, we learned a lot about economic theory and the idea of float currency. And, opposes, one of the worst economic depression ever, of all time. A lot of countries were like, damn, it’d be really cool if we could print more money to give to people to buy shit to reinvigorate the economy. @@@@@@A lot of stuff happened, the Weimar Republic tried to print themselves out of debt then failed, we learned a bit more about inflation, and we learned that shit is crazy when any economy can change the value of their currency Willy nilly. So we had a bunch of meetings and ended with Breton woods, where other countries could tie their currency to the amount of dollars they own (they can buy more!) and the us tied our dollars to gold. @@@@@@Which worked really well but the us wanted to be able to have flexibility on our own money supply, as we can see why in this last recession, it lasted like a year because we were able to raise water in the money fish tank so to speak. @@@@@@So then we got rid of Breton woods and all of us use floating currencies now and we have a thing called the world trade organization that tries to use unilateral action to stop bad actors from fucking with their currencies.

                "Let's say the city government wants a big chunk of money to build a bridge. They can save up and build it later, or they can sell bonds, which is a way of borrowing money, so that they can build it now. Each bond will have a face value, let's say $1000, a coupon rate, let's say 5%, and a duration, let's say 10 years. These are values picked by the people selling the bond. This means that to buy the bond, you give the government $1000. Then, they will give you $50 (5% of the face value) back each year, for the next 10 years. After 10 years is up, they'll give you back $1000 as well. So, on the basic level, bonds are pretty simple. The government borrowed money, and eventually paid it back with interest. You invested some money, and eventually got it back with interest.@@@@@@However, it's also possible to resell bonds, and that's where the complicated math comes in. Let's say you bought that bond, and now it's three years later. You are impatient and don't want to wait seven more years to get the $1000 back, so you decide to sell the bond. Someone will give you some money, and they'll get the interest payments and the $1000 when the bond matures in seven years. How much should you charge? Well, you could sell it for $1000, and that would be ok. You'd have made 5% interest for three years, and the buyer will be making 5% interest for the next seven years in that case. But what if interest rates are down, and most bonds being issued today only give 4% interest? Then your bond, which pays 5%, is better than most bonds, and so you can sell it for extra. Maybe you sell it for $1100, but the buyer still only gets $50 each year and $1000 at the end. They are still making $1350 in total, but paying $1100 and earning $1350 is no longer 5% interest. So you need to redo the math. And so there is a complicated way of doing the math to figure out how much to sell a bond for, so that a 5% bond with seven years left ends up paying out as if it were a 4% bond. So, it can get a bit complicated when bonds are re-sold.@@@@@@Also, when a bond is initially sold, it might be sold at a different value than it's face value then as well, so the math can be complicated anytime!",
                "Bonds are basically loans. An institution (government, company, etc.) issue bonds as a way to raise money they need now, and then pay interest to the investors who bought the bonds for the specified period of time before returning the principal.@@@@@@So if you bought a bond, you'd get paid the interest it specified. If it was a 10-year bond that paid 5% interest annually and you paid $20k, you'd get $1,000 a year (typically paid twice a year, $500 every 6 months), and at the end of 10 years, you'd get your original $20k back.@@@@@@The bond issuers do so because they need the money up front to fund some sort of growth, development, etc. A business might issue a bond to buy a piece of property and develop it, then using the proceeds from that additional business to pay back the bond. A government might use a bond to fund a new school or highway, using property taxes or tolls to pay back the bond issue over time."

This mitigates, but does not eliminate, risk because the odds of all of those mortgages failing are very, very small. However, some of them will fail. The creator of an MBS then divides them into slices called tranches, and then sells the individual tranches to investors. The key thing to remember here is that all tranches are not equal, and some are rated as being riskier than others. As people pay their mortgages, those payments are divided among the owners of the tranches, with lower risk tranches getting paid first and higher risk tranches getting paid last (or not at all). So, the pricing of a given tranche is going to be based on the overall value of the mortgages in the MBS, divided by the number of tranches, and then weighted based upon the risk level of the tranche.@@@@@@What happened in the 2000s, was that firms would buy up the high risk tranches, bundle them up like the original MBS, slice them into new tranches and then sell them. And then others would buy up all the high risk tranches from those instruments and repeat the process. They were able to offer such high returns because there came a point where nobody could properly value the underlying assets."

This caused issues at the ports & with logistic services that take products to the ports to ship.@@@@@@2. Ports have a LOT of cargo to deal with & have only so many people. If there’s still reduction of employees working then that will contribute to issues at port. That backlog of products being moved is causing major, major delays around the world.

Some ships opted to go around Africa which added weeks to their routes.

Certain items are harder to come by due to supply issues. Chicken for the last few months have been scarce because farmers opted to cull chickens last year due to not being able to process them & have scaled back for the time as they can’t get it processed due to labor shortages at processing plants or COVID.

All those delays to all those ships resulted in shortages around the world then coupled with backlogs of ships that couldn’t get into port plus COVID.\n4. Local supply issues.

Who is actually trading USDLBP at that price when it is obviously massively off-market? Why does the official FX market not correct to line up with the black market rate?",

                "Life insurance is a policy in which you agree to pay the company a certain amount of money every month and in the event of your death they will pay out an agreed upon amount of money to whomever you designate as the beneficiary. There's a lot of people who have explained that concept in this thread but they don't mention the different types of life insurance.@@@@@@&#x200B;@@@@@@Life Insurance comes in two flavors; Term and Permanent@@@@@@Term is just how it sounds, you pay a certain amount per month for 10,20, or 30 years (usually, there are other time options) and if you die in that period of time, your beneficiary gets the death benefit. It's the cheapest form of life insurance so you can buy a lot of coverage for not very much per month. The draw back is that it is basically renting the coverage because if the term ends and you're alive, you don't get anything. It's primary purpose is to have SOMETHING in place if the worst happens and to lock in your rates and insurability when you're young and healthy. You can convert to a permanent policy with the same rates later down the line. @@@@@@Permanent is where things get interesting and are the best value for you. While only \\~2% of term policies actually pay out, 98% of permanent payments pay out. Most permanent policies will accumulate a cash balance over time that can be borrowed against for use of a down payment on a house, car, whatever. The cash balance can also be used as a retirement supplement. So you can essentially act as your own banker with it as long as you keep it paid and let the cash balance grow. @@@@@@Permanent policies are also the most expensive, so again, when you're young is the best time to look at them. Some policies have flexible premiums, some let you completely pay up the policy in a certain amount of years so when you're done paying it up it's just yours and the cash balance can just keep growing without you needing to pay the monthly premium. Some policies will tie the interest rate on the cash balance to a stock market index with a floor and ceiling to help you maximize gains. @@@@@@People like to try to make life insurance cut and dry but there's a lot to it and it is a VERY valuable thing to have that is very separate from your savings which is just what you've set aside in your bank acct/Roth IRA/401k, etc. If you die without it then your family has to figure out where the money for the funeral will come from, your S/O will need to figure out how to keep mortgage/rent payments coming, get kids through school, get other debts paid, etc. Don't buy it willy nilly, work with a reputable agent to see what will work best for you and your needs. @@@@@@I know this was a more in depth explanation than a 5 year old can handle but people need to know this shit"

If your credit score is low, they know you either have a lot of debt already, have a poor history of paying back loans, or are considered unlikely to pay back the loan for some other reason.

So even as his stock has gained 10's of billions in value over the past year, he isn't taxed on that. Let's say he sells $10m worth of shares to cover living expenses, he pays capital gains taxes on that, which are lower than income taxes at top income bracket -- only 20% for incomes over $441k. So in this example, assuming Bezos' shares had 0 cost basis, his $10m sale would trigger a $2m tax bill. Not nothing, but basically a rounding error vs. his wealth.@@@@@@The other way that some wealthy reduce taxable income is through a business. By deducting expenses \"for the business\" they can cut their taxable income and buy things with pre-tax dollars. Say you're a dentist who wants to vacation in Hawaii... find a Dental Conference going on there, attend and tack on a vacation after the conference -- deduct some of the hotel, meals, all the airfare, etc. to cut your true cost of vacationing in Hawaii.

The shares are where your wealth is at.@@@@@@Now, like all the other super-rich, you've decided that you need your own private space program. You can't buy one of those with your regular income, and you don't want to have to sell a couple billion worth of shares (both because that would leave you with fewer shares, but also because you'd then have to pay taxes on the sale, and as a multi-billionaire you really think that \"contributing to society\" is beneath you. Taxes are for poor people!)@@@@@@So instead, you go to a bank, and say \"Hi, I'd like to borrow a billion dollars. I can put up a billion dollars' worth of shares as collateral, so there's really no risk to you\"@@@@@@To the banks, this is a really good deal, so they accept, and lend you a billion dollars at a very low interest rate.@@@@@@But with a loan that size, even a low interest adds up, so you end up paying quite a lot in interest, possibly more than your actual income. So you declare this as a tax deductable, and the taxman goes \"oh no, it must be so hard being you. Don't worry, you won't have to pay any taxes\".@@@@@@So at the end of the day, you've paid a bit of money to the bank, sure, but you got to keep all of your shares, and you avoided those icky taxes.@@@@@@The reason normal people can't do the same is that we don't have enough wealth to be able to take out such huge loans.

If immigration to your nation requires special skills or otherwise imposes a test of some sort for immigrants, the curve becomes heavily slanted towards high ambition individuals.@@@@@@Consider Nigerians. In Nigeria, Nigerians have the same sort of bell curve as any nation. Some are ambitious, some not. But if you look at the Nigerians who manage to immigrate to the U.S., they're almost all highly ambitious.

        "natural_text": "تورم یک مسئله بسیار پیچیده است. یکی از دلایلی که سبب می‌شود کاملاً متوقف کردن آن دشوار باشد، این است که مردم دوست دارند تورم را به ایده‌ای نسبت دهند که ما پول بیش از حد چاپ می‌کنیم، اما این موضوع از آن پیچیده‌تر است. افزایش تورم کنونی که مشاهده می‌شود، همانند بسیاری از موارد دیگر در جهان امروز، به دلیل ویروس کووید و مشکل عرضه و تقاضا است.\nدر اقتصاد 101 شما از عرضه و تقاضا مطلع می‌شوید. اگر عرضه بالا و تقاضای کمی برای یک کالا وجود داشته باشد، قیمت هر کالای فردی پایین خواهد بود. اگر تقاضای بالا و عرضه کمی وجود داشته باشد، قیمت هر کالای فردی بیشتر خواهد بود.\nبرای یک سال و نیم گذشته، مصرف‌کنندگان اندکی پول صرف نمی‌کردند. اگر مردم چیزها را خریداری نکنند، شرکت‌ها کمتری از آن‌ها تولید می‌کنند و فروشگاه‌ها کمتری از آن‌ها موجود می‌کنند. (به عبارت دیگر \"تقاضای کم\") با این حال، مردم اکنون به الگوهای قدیمی خرید برگشته‌اند، اما تولید کالاها کند به تناسب تغییر نکرده است. بنابراین، تقاضا برای کالاها افزایش یافته است اما عرضه برای تطابق با آن کم است، بنابراین قیمت هر کالای فردی افزایش یافته است.\nعامل دوم برای افزایش تورم کنونی، نتیجه تلاش‌های دولت برای حفظ اقتصاد در زمانی که مردم به اندازه کافی خرید نمی‌کردند، است. اصولاً این کار توسط فدرال انجام شد که نرخ بهره را به نزدیک صفر کاهش داد. این موضوع به تنهایی پیچیده است و به چه معنی است، اما برای اهداف ما، تنها نیاز دارید بدانید که نزدیک به نرخ بهره صفر به معنای آن است که مردم وام می‌گیرند، عمدتاً وام مسکن، برای بهره‌ای کم و بهره‌ای کمتر از آن بهره‌مند شوند. متأسفانه، بازار مسکن نیز محدود است که باعث افزایش قیمت هر خانه می‌شود.\nهمه این‌ها باعث می‌شود تا قدرت خرید فعلی یک دلار کمتر از آنچه بوده باشد، یا حداقل باعث می‌شود بازار آن را به عنوان چنین مشاهده کند. این به این معنی نیست که باید بروید و سعی کنید چیزهایی را بخرید که ارزش خود را حفظ می‌کنند. این نوع تورم موقت به زودی عادی خواهد شد و این امر در بازار مسکن قبلاً آغاز شده است."

That could be the official fixing, but if you offer to pay anyone for their service with either 10 pesos or 10 dollars, they'd pick the dollars, because they accurately believe that if this new state of things is disturbed tomorrow, the dollars would be more valuable as savings. So, you may test and see what the actual exchange ratio is that people recognize. Offer them 11 pesos or 10 dollars, then 12 pesos or 10 dollars, keep going that way until you see how low they actually value their pesos. Realistically, in very extreme cases you may see a government ban the use of other currencies for internal use, like we saw in Afghanistan early this month. That's your final ditch effort to stabilize the use of your currency, but typically signals desperation and makes demand for foreign currencies even higher.",
                "Very small economies that trade a lot with neighboring large economies often do peg their currency to that of their larger neighbor. Someone mentioned Denmark in another post; this is also seen in the Caribbean where many of the small island nations officially have their own currency but it's pegged to the USD. This is partly a way of catering to tourists and partly a way to keep prices stable on imported goods (which is most goods in their cases).@@@@@@For the examples mentioned in the original post, those have different motivations to be floating currency.@@@@@@JPY floats because the country is stable, democratic, with a capitalist economy, and their large financial sector benefits by being able to trade in multiple currencies. Essentially, the rules there are transparent, slow to change, and maintained by serious and experienced people. This enables the JPY to float, and thus the government and business can use exchange rates to their mutual advantage.@@@@@@The other example floats because they have to. The country's economy is small, it doesn't trade extensively with a large and stable neighbor, and the government is hugely corrupt. Currency exchange rates are a reflection of trust. If few people trust a government or its central bank, then their currency will be poorly regarded and the exchange rate will reflect that. When the residents also don't trust their government, expect to see the local currency used sparingly, for small purchases only, and expect at least one stable outside currency in use right alongside it. This is the case in CAR. If the government there tried to peg the currency to, say, the USD, everyone would ignore it.",

                "Keeping the currency stable at *exactly* 1 USD (called \"pegging\", but don't google that) would mean massive interventions in a country's monetary policy, which is often bad for the economy. It's sometimes done, but often only temporarily.@@@@@@If you mean \"the Yen is hovering somewhere around 0.01 USD, why can't they change it so it hovers around 1 USD, like the Euro\" - it's possible. France did it around 1960, and Russia around 2000. So why doesn't Japan do it? Probably because it is a huge hassle, printing and minting new bills and coins and price tags, and doesn't actually do anything for the economy. The only real benefit is that people need to write fewer zeros when dealing with larger amounts, but the Yen is not that bad in that regard (unlike the Italian Lira pre-Euro), and has the benefit that you never need fractions of a Yen. Other than that such a reform is primarily good for people whose ego suffers from having a currency that's worth less than the Dollar."

Basicly the case.@@@@@@@@@>So lets say bank A has 10 billion dollars and Company B comes along and want to lend 100 billion dollars, then bank A are allowed to create 90 billion dollars out of thin air.@@@@@@Close: the federal reserve creates the 90 billion from \" thin air \" by adding some digits to the Bank A's lending account at the Fed. Bank A gives that to company B.@@@@@@>@@@My question is, what happens when Company B defaults? Does bank A have any liability for the 90 billions? @@@I'm not 100% sure. Bank A does owe the Fed but I'm not sure what actually happens if they can't pay. My guess is that if they have too many defaults on the books then the Fed or in some cases congress intervens with a bailout / some kind of debt restructuring/  or takinging the bank and forcing a sale to a new bank. My guess is that the Fed doesn't always get made whole.@@@@@@@@@The kicker is that all that \" free money \" means there is inflation (the steady eroding of the money you're trying to save and the steady devaluing of your paycheck).

                "Effectively, yes they can. @@@@@@They get most of the money they need for the loan from the central bank, at whatever the central bank rate is, then lend it to you at some markup rate above that. They are required to have typically something like 10% in reserves to account for the risk of potential bad debt, but they typically give out secured loans for any large amount. For instance, they have a mortgage contract for your house, so if you stop making repayments, they can sell your house to get their money back, and don't need to dip into those reserves anyway.",

Again this varies based on the jurisdiction, but usually exempt property includes your car (but not a second car or further vehicles), your house (sort of), and any necessary items like household appliances, necessary clothing, any tools you need for your job, etc. Whether you actually get to keep your house depends, though. If you hold too much equity in your home (the amount of your mortgage debt that you've paid off), more than what is legally exempt, then this may trigger a sale and you'll lose your home. If you get to keep your home, then you also keep the mortgage on it so that debt doesn't go away. Same goes if you get to keep your car but you took out a car loan to purchase it. Student loans or tax debts also aren't cleared.@@@@@@Anything that isn't exempt, though, you are likely to lose. That also includes things like family heirlooms. So it's really not a freebie. You will lose a bunch of your stuff, and you don't get to decide what you lose. Once they are done selling off your assets, you do get a clean slate...sort of. Secured debts like mortgages and car loans are not cleared, nor does chapter 7 bankruptcy do anything to change the terms of your repayment on those loans. If you were already behind on your mortgage, the bankruptcy won't help with that, other than to hopefully leave you with more financial breathing room afterwards to catch up on those payments.@@@@@@Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a bit less drastic. In this case the court won't sell any of your assets, but will impose a payment plan lasting several years that you *must* comply with (otherwise you risk losing your assets after all). The court will decide how much of your debt you have to repay over this period. Again, any \"secured debt\" like mortgages and car loans will not be discharged - you will still have to repay them in full. Unsecured debt (e.g. credit card debt) may be partially discharged without payment, but the court will try to get you to pay back as much as possible. @@@@@@Chapter 7 is basically for people who do not have enough income to have any hope of paying back a reasonable amount of their debt in the next 5 years. Chapter 13 is for people who do have enough income to repay a substantial part of their debt, or even all of it if they can get more lenient terms to repay it. Chapter 13 provides a more manageable repayment plan that allows people to get out of their debt hole (which would otherwise be difficult, e.g. because of high interest and other fees that they would keep accumulating on their debt under the original terms of the credit). Both come with conditions. Whether you can file for either type of bankruptcy depends on your income and how much secured and unsecured debt you have.@@@@@@So, what's the drawback of bankruptcy? Well, under chapter 7, the court will take a bunch of your stuff. Under chapter 13, the court will impose a payment plan that you have to comply with. In both cases, you have to temporarily give up a substantial amount of control over your life. And, as I said, it doesn't magically clear all your debt. The court will try to get as much of your debt repaid as possible, and only then let you off the hook (for some of it). Bankruptcy is a fresh start in every sense: you get another chance at life without crushing debts, but you also have to start basically from scratch as far as your wealth is concerned. You will also take a big hit on your credit score, but that may be less relevant if you were already behind on e.g. your mortgage and credit card payments. @@@@@@For all these reasons, it's usually better to avoid bankruptcy if you can, because then you get to retain more control over your life and possessions."

                "What your seeing as supply and demand is an highly abstracted version of the true mechanisms to make it easier for first years to understand. In economics we abstract a lot to make models easier to understand at the cost of realism. @@@@@@@@@Now in regard to your question, you explained it yourself. Demand for housing rises, this lets sellers charge more because they'll be able to grab more profits. Additionally, this demand is very inelastic, higher prices don't decrease demand in 1:1 proportion. A lot of people buying housing aren't going to not buy a house simply because it costs more. When your already spending 300k for a house, whats another 3k. Theres no real substitutes for housing other than renting which follows the same trend.@@@@@@@@@Manufacturing costs is a red herring for housing because of the time it takes to produce. With other goods, lowering prices and selling more quantity is better for profits, but with housing it can takes years to construct. This almost leads to a situation of constant excess demand, supply can't keep up at the time. If lower costs allows them to produce more housing and sell at a lower price, then in that time it takes to construct housing, demand has surpassed any price decrease. @@@@@@@@@Theres also the issue of reselling. Unlike second hand cars, people would rather sell their house for more than they brought it for. And because of this excess demand in the market they can. This cases further price increases in the market.@@@@@@@@@One specific model which has gained a lot of ground recently is the hedonic pricing model for housing. This identifies internal (characteristics of the property) and external (local area such as crime rates) to explain variation and trends in pricing."

And they'll learn it through idealized models. This does not qualify them to design bridges. The equations in this form are insufficient for analysis of real life complex structures and dynamics. But it is still taught as the entry point to more sophisticated models.@@@@@@The same goes for economics. Taking an entry level course and learning about basic supply and demand theory is to get a grounding on the subject. It is, naturally, insufficient for any sophisticated modelling of micro (market based) or macro (aggregate level) actions. @@@@@@Anyway for a more direct response, economic signals all have a lag time. Increased demand typically shows up in the short term as price increases. Price increases are a signal that excess profits are available. A normally reacting market will react to excess profits by increasing supply of the product and nearby substitutes. This new supply will generally lead to greater competition and result in prices falling. @@@@@@Understanding the lags in the system are important. Modelling the systemic behavior under different lag situations is tough. Knowing what factors drive certain lags in different markets is important. For example, the semiconductor industry might take years to increase capacity, farmers cannot react to increased demand until the next planting season etc etc.",
                "Manufacturing costs go down *eventually*@@@@@@Company A has been manufacturing widgets for decades, they see 10% growth in widget sales per year and build capacity a bit more than that.@@@@@@Last year they had a demand of 10,000 widgets, this year they have a demand of 15,000 widgets!  That's a 50% growth@@@@@@Price will temporarily increase as all of their widgets sell out from the vendors and become hard to find.  Then the company has to find a way to build more, maybe they start paying people significant overtime to work on weekends while they buy faster machines, both cost significant amounts.  They also have to get the parts for their widgets but their suppliers weren't ready for this either so now they're fighting other companies for any excess supply and paying 10x the price for a relatively simple part that they can't build without.@@@@@@They also have to be careful not to just now assume 50% sales growth because then they'll spend too much on equipment that might go unused if sales drop to 12,000 widgets next year so its not a matter of just ramping up production immediately because that can cost you more in the long term than some missed sales today.@@@@@@Price only goes down when supply gets up to match the demand (pushing the marginal cost down) but sudden spikes in demand result in sudden price jumps because the system isn't ready for it.  Similarly drops in demand can result in excess supply which causes prices to temporarily plummet.  Either scenario can be very bad for a company."

Thats something called monatary policy.  The federal reserve sets an interest rate that it loans money to banks at and those banks in turn loan out that money to people and companies.

What is important to keep in mind is that the debt of a government is not the same kind of debt an individual might have. Governments keeps paying old loans fully, they just tend to take more debt all the time. Debt of any government isn't just one big debt, it is collection of many different loans, different kinds of loans, in many different banks, with different terms. Now sometimes government even gives out loans.@@@@@@If government was unable to pay off those loans, even with new ones, then that is a bad situation. Usually they don't even borrow money to pay off loans. But pay the loans off with taxes, and take borrow more money to cover other expenses. This doesn't matter if you look at the government budget as a big pot of money, but that is not how government book keeping works. There are laws that might restrict use of certain budgets, or certain incomes. @@@@@@I take my country for example. Like many countries, Finland takes more and more debt.

But as others have posted, the increase in contactless payment methods and decrease in physical money usage in general has led to a decrease in coin circulation, and thus a shortage.@@@@@@Another non-zero but minor factor would be numismatics; coin collecting.  There have always been numismatists that have taken a fraction of the coin supply entirely out of circulation for collecting purposes.  And like many hobbies during lockdowns, there was a potential increase in the numbers of people getting involved in the hobby.

Okay, there's dozens, but specifically with regard to your question what you're looking for is the difference between \"time-weighted\" and \"money-weighted\" returns. There are multiple formulas to determine both, and each have their uses. Each dollar you put in or take out is weighted to come out to an aggregate performance number, and it'll look different based on how you weight the dollars in/out. The general difference is that time-weighted return does not factor in the timing of additions/withdrawals, while money-weighted return does. Said another way, time-weighted return shows the return of an investment, money-weighted return shows the return of YOUR investment in that same thing.@@@@@@Here's an example. Let's say you buy ABC stock with $10K, then six months later ABC has fallen 50%. On that date, you add an additional $5K and buy ABC stock with it. Over the next six months, ABC rises 100%. If it goes down 50%, it has to rise 100% to get back to even, so ABC's return is flat over this year, and thus your return is also flat on the $10K. But, your return on the additional $5K is 100%. Time-weighted return strips out that lucky timing and measures only the performance of ABC, so your total time-weighted return is still flat on the whole $15K. But, your money-weighted return will be much higher than 0% because the return on the $5K was 100% and it isn't adjusted for.@@@@@@If you didn't make any additions, then your money- and time-weighted returns will be the same.
