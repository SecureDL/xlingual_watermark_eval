        "natural_text": "To some degree, those are synonyms.\nLoosely but not in any strict legal sense, “illegal” more often refers to an action that constitutes a crime — a violation of the law that can subject the actor to criminal prosecution by the government, leading to a conviction, a criminal record, and potentially a custodial sentence.\nLoosely but not in any strict legal sense, “unlawful” more often refers to an action that constitutes any contravention of any law, even if that contravention of the law cannot lead to criminal penalties. Some common examples of something unlawful but not criminal might include committing a civil wrong against a person (say, breaking your lease), or being late in paying a fine, or remaining in the country without legal status.\nWhen the government itself fails to comply with a statute or regulation, that too is more likely to be termed “unlawful” than “illegal.”"

As a result her parents were able to get a court order that essentially removed her ability to control her own life/free will. In this legal process her ability to chose where/when how to live, work, spend her money; basically many any independent choices were removed from her. In a sense she is a slave to her legal guardians. \nShe has recently begun a highly publicized legal attempt to have these guard rails removed from her life and basically become a normal person again."

        "natural_text": "That only works if the people to whom you are snitching are all benevolent and their punishments are fair. Most criminal justice systems are still rife with abuses of power and systemic racism. A lot of crimes are directly a result of people being forced to live in systems of oppression. Many gangs were originally created to protect communities that were being either brutalized or ignored by law enforcement. A lot of drug dealers say they got into dealing because it was the only way they could imagine making enough money to buy nice things and provide for their families.   \nIn the US, the prison population is predominantly BIPOC and low-income, meaning they've experienced a lot of oppression before they entered. They may not have had access to adequate legal representation because our public defenders are criminally overworked. They're exploited for free or cheap labor (watch the 13th by Ava Duvernay), and they leave in debt and a record that will disqualify them from some jobs and housing and come up in background checks for those that are available.   \nSo, for a lot of incarcerated people, snitching is not going to protect people. It is going to serve the oppressors and offer up another person to be abused by the system. Even if you hate the \"bad guy,\" you may not want to see him fucked over by your greater enemy.   \nAlso, there's a long history of \"jailhouse snitches\" who lied. Sometimes they make up whatever they think will get them the best deal (usually years off their sentence), and sometimes law enforcement purposefully houses a snitch with someone awaiting trial so that they can get a \"confession.\""

The Ego is your sense of self, your self-esteem, your conscious decision making ability, your experience of reality.

        "natural_text": "- Sanctions are (mostly) economic measures imposed to its own economy in order to force a country to stop doing X, if the enforcing county deems X being contrary to its national interests. Normally they include a stop to specific trades, economic transfers or industries. A classic example would be *\"we are not selling nuclear weapon technology to North Korea, every company doing that will be punished\"*.\n- Sanctions are not unusual. While they are often the last resort of countries short before a war, they are used by economic more influential countries on countries to stop human atrocities or of specific nations gaining economic power or technology which could destabilize an entire region. \n- In many cases sanctions are not obviously successful, but in some cases it forces a country to stop aggressive actions or at least back down. Often enough however they are used as a propaganda instrument from the affected country in order to galvanize the population ... and for the population of enforcing country \n- In many cases a country (lets call it A) would not interfere with trades between Countries B and C. The problem is: the world wide economy is connected internationally and many payment systems and trades are done via US bank and payment systems. With that the US has a certain pressure power to enforce sanctions even when the trade does not directly involve their own economy.\nRegarding Russia: Russia is currently threatening (more or less directly) to invade the Ukraine, and is involved with the Crimea Occupation and the destruction of MH17. With that both the EU and the US have imposed sanctions of various levels on Russia, as especially the EU would not like to have a full blown war next to their eastern border. It most certainly did not helped that Russia attempted and performed multiple assassinations with radioactive particles and nerve gas in European countries.\nSYL"

Anything greater than $950 is a felony, anything below $50 can be charged as a minor infractions and anything between is a misdemeanor. \nWhere these people may be confused is that *Walgreens doesn't have to enforce these laws*.  It is not, repeat **NOT**, Walgreen's place or right to enforce laws covering larceny.  That is what the police are for, that is literally their primary function - enforce the law.  Walgreen's cannot arrest a person for shoplifting.  Now there is a bit of gray area because they do have a right to defend their property, so if they caught someone they COULD detain the person until the Police arrive but that's the point.  The Police HAVE to get involved. \nThus it becomes a business decision.  Walgreens is a multi-billion dollar company.  Someone stealing $50 of random crap from one store is such a small number that they probably accidentally lose that money in spare change under the seats of the CEO's private jet.  It would not at all be unusual for Walgreens to say \"if you see someone shoplifting note down their description and call the cops but otherwise do NOT engage with them\" because they'd rather lose the goods than have an employee hurt or even killed trying to be a hero.  \nYou know who else has this policy - Banks.  Any bank in the US you can walk in and say \"this is a robbery\" and there is a good chance they'll open up the cash drawer and let you walk out with it.  Of course a few minutes later the Police and/or FBI will come to kick your head in but that's not the Bank's problem.

Here in the UK, that age is 16. So if we have two people under 16 that have sex with each other, the law is essentially saying neither person was mature enough to make an informed decision either way on doing it. What this means is it would be very unfair to simultaneously say \"you didn't know what you were doing\" *and* \"we should punish you for doing it\".\nEdit: I should specify that the larger the age gap between the two underage participants, the less likely it is the older member will not be punished.

For example, if someone breaks into your home, runs at you with a knife, and you kill him in self-defense—you didn’t commit murder, or any other crime. It was justified.\nWar takes this idea and extends it to the national level. Soldiers kill other soldiers, but it’s all (theoretically) in defense of the home country. At that point, you get into a plethora of theories on what constitutes a “just war” vs an unjust war, and leaders can sometimes be held to account for the latter category."

        "natural_text": "Attorney here.  Normally when the parties to a contract are in a dispute, one of them can file a lawsuit in the courts to try to get the problem sorted out. Sometimes, the parties will agree to have someone smart and experienced but who is not a judge(an arbitrator) basically conduct an informal trial just like a judge, and the parties agree that they'll treat that decision just like it was done by a judge.  Agreeingto treat the arbitrator's decision just like a judge's decision is what makes the decision *binding.* \nThe parties can make the agreement to use an arbitrator at any time. Sometimes it might be after they start disputing and they both just figure it's faster and cheaper to use arbitration. In that situation, neither has to; if you'd rather use the courts, you can decline to arbitrate.  \n*Mandatory* arbitration is when you can ONLY resolve a dispute through arbitration. The agreement to skip the courts and only use arbitration almost always comes as part of signing the main contract.  So like when you enter a cell phone contract,  that contract will usually include a provision that says both sides agree that they'll only take their disputes to arbitration through so-and-so arbitration organization. \nMany people see this kind of arbitration as favoring the company because of the company is always having so-and-so organization doing the arbitration,  that's a lot of money for the organization,  and some people think that the organization is going to return the favor and make rulings in the company's favor.  \nSo why would anyone agree to mandatory binding arbitration?  It's because they essentially have no choice. You have the choice not to buy the product or enter the contract at all, of course... but if you do decide to enter that contract,  you're pretty much stuck with the contract terms. It's take it or leave it. In contracts where each side thinks the other is important enough,  they can negotiate and tweak certain parts. But in a deal between the average schlub and Blizzard, Blizzard isn't going to waste their time trying negotiating the contract. Take it or leave it, they say.  \nIn various places, laws have been passed to say that for some types of contract,  you must have the right to change your mind about mandatory arbitration, but will put a time limit on that.  So for instance, in my last cell phone contract I had 30 days after signing the contract to tell the phone company I didn't want to do mandatory arbitration. \nGetting rid of mandatory arbitration would mean that Activision/Blizzard might not be so confident about their chances of success in arbitration, in which case maybe they'd behave better toward their customers."

Activists do so by suing the government, judge, or whoever is enforcing the law.\nBecause abortion laws all violate the Supreme Court precedent set by Roe vs Wade they are almost always immediately struck down so they basically become unenforceable and never go into effect. Despite this Conservative States keep trying various iterations of anti-abortion laws over and over again even though there's no real point, the constitutionality of abortion laws is pretty well settled. If these laws remain on the books eventually they reach the Supreme Court who then strike it down for good.\nIn this case though SB8 is specifically tailored to get around this. In a rather scummy way at that. Because the law allows regular citizens to basically become bounty hunters to turn in people that have abortions, the government and courts don't technically enforce this law so you can't take the usual route to get this law over turned.\nSo the law will go into effect until such a time that someone actually tries to cash in the bounty on an abortion at which point it will work its way up to the Supreme Court and will likely get struck down like all the rest.\nThe catch is how many Abortions will be stopped in the meanwhile?"

This data is now fragmented. This works fine, but can obviously get annoying to have to run to two sections of the library to go get that info. So you under go the great library defragmentation.

Because of this, people feel like they have a chance to get away with it.\nThen there's the issue in some cities in California having a rule where any petty theft under $995 will not be pursued. This has lead to people shoplifting on mass because they know they can get away with it.\nTo add, being stuck in your house without a job can really tax on people. This is why a lot of people were going out and marching because despite covid, the marches themselves were not really policed in spite of people being really close to one another. This promoted people to be activists even when they didn't believe or really understand what was going on. Now that the activism has slowed down due to the election being over, people are still used to wondering the streets and given that they've been told they live in a racist system and that capitalism is evil, it's not a surprise that many people would vandalize places in these cities.\nAlthough the weather isn't as much of a factor, it is getting nicer out so people are going out more. A lot of crime is spontaneous, you see a house, no one is watching, you wrap your head in a shirt and break in to steal some shit.\nNot to mention that covid killed a lot of jobs and now that people have been not working for several months, people have decided that they don't want to work, which has caused a labor shortage. This leads to people being overworked because the jobs they do still demand work from them only now there's less help, and that causes stress, frustration, and that might be channeled from the previous point on being an activist. It can also just result in fights breaking out, people are on edge and there's a lot of division in the country right now.\nAnd no, it's not just the summer, places like NYC have a jump in crime %22 compared to this time last year.

Prop master's are not perfect, I briefly worked ot set design for a theater and while I was there someone got cut on a knife because the prop master have them a sharp one instead of a dull prop knife. When you are doing something thousands of times, you will make a mistake.\nWhat Baldwin should have done was to check the gun when he received it. Actors have a responsibility for their props, especially when they are weapons.\nObviously he had to aim it for the scene, but in general you should never aim a gun, unloaded or not at anyone. Even if you are 99.99% sure it's safe, that's way to risky to do. For comparison, skydiving is a viewed as risky, but it is 99.9999% safe.\nThe question is that: do you trust the armorer enough to blindly put your or someone elses life at stake by not doing a 5 second check of your gun?"

        "prompt": "Q: Repudiation Attack\nA:",
        "natural_text": "Let's start with the simplest attack, and work up to the more complex.\nAlice owns a bank.  Bob somehow gains access ( dumpster diving for passwords on paper, or threatening Alice employee, etc ).  Bob then can steal information,  This is known as an ACCESS ATTACK.  The downside ( from Bob's point of view  ) is that Bob has information, but he has to engage in some second activity to monetize it.\nSuppose Bob wants to do a bit more, particularly if he wants to damage Alice's bank.  He goes to his stockbroker, buys puts ( contracts that guarantee the sale of a stock at a certain price ) then changes Alices web page.  Bob has graduated from reading data to writing data.  This is known as a MODIFICATION ATTACK.\nWhen the world reads that Alice's web page that now openly supports Stormfront, her stock tanks, and Bob buys the stock at a low price, invokes the contract with his broker, and sells at a high price.  This is riskier than a simple access attack because there are now clear traces showing how Bob profited.  There is also the downside that Alice will be very aware that she has been attacked, and this will lead her to harden her defenses, and to call the cops.\nSo Bob may add a new wrinkle.  He not only modifies information in Alice's database, but he then defrauds Alice directly, using her corrupted data against her.   **It is this direct, post-modification contact that make Bob's actions a REPUDIATION ATTACK**.\nBob, in preparation for the attack, took out a loan with Alice's bank.  When he does his modification attack, he changes Alice's records to show that he paid off the loan.  When Alice's bank requests the regular monthly payment from Bob, Bob calls up Alice's customer service, and informs them that they made a mistake.  They check their records, and decide that the loan is indeed paid off.\nSo Bob walks away with free money.    The upside of the repudiation attack is that if Bob has done it skillfully, Alice may never know.  Bob may be able to do it multiple times.\nThe downside - from Bob's point of view - of a repudiation attack is that he has to give up some contact information to Alice.  If Alice's security people are on their toes, they might be able to trap Bob.\nSuppose that Charlie, Alice's data security officer, is indeed on his toes.  Prior to Bob's attack, Charlie wrote a maintenance program that runs in the background, checking all alleged payments.   Any time a payment is recorded as having been made, Charlie's program attempts to match the payment with ACH records from whichever bank was the other party in the transfer.\nAny time that the maintenance program detects a problem, it sends a text message to Charlie.  When Bob commits his modification attack, Charlie knows about it within minutes.\nCharlie contacts Dave, the agent who works in the financial crimes division of the local FBI office.  Charlie has Bob's telephone number from the call to customer service, and Bob's social security number and home address from the loan application.  Dave then gets a warrant to search Bob's premises.\nDave then goes...well, we are getting a bit off topic now.  We will leave Dave and Bob to their cat and mouse games.  The important point here is that a repudiation attack involves post-attack involvement with the victim, and therefore can be very risky."

For things that are fine-only like with traffic tickets you'll very likely get a bench trial (judge), as well as in some civil cases.\nThis is to balance between the right to jury trial, and the right to a speedy trial. If every speeding ticket needed to get run through 12 people with unanimous vote to convict before they get fined, the system would bog down Even more than it already is. There also is a desire to minimise costs, and jurors are paid for their time and travel, so if you hold jury trial days on say just Monday Wednesday Friday each week and just slog through all the petty stuff on the other days you keep the system moving and reduce jury costs by 40%."

        "natural_text": "there are huge differences. \"jailbreak\" at its core just means you have broken out of the jail iOS puts each app in, allowing it to access more of the system. most jailbreaks do leverage this to gain root access which means you can theoretically do anything, but you have to be very careful with it because modifying the wrong file can render the phone inoperable (like deleting system32 from windows, but worse)\neven with jailbreak iphones typically remain locked into iOS. the whole boot process is controlled so it can only boot into iOS, and then only into versions of iOS that apple signed for you to install. if you mess up your jailbroken iOS 13 or 14 and want to reinstall it (like you would reinstall windows after deleting system32), apple will instead force you to update to iOS 15 and you'll be stuck there\nso the things you can do with jailbreak are rather limited. it's been years since anyone has achieved an untethered jailbreak, meaning it boots directly into a jailbroken state. you alwasy boot into stock iOS, open unc0ver, and let it run an exploit to re-jailbreak. nobody has truly eliminated the sideloading restriction either. with a regular account you can only sideload a handful of apps, and you have to re-sign them every 7 days or they stop working\nso the idea that a jailbroken phone is a bigger security risk than a PC, which has ways to gain full access to everything built in, is silly. the truth is a mix of security theater, misinformed managers, and user-hostility. a lot of companies would love to lock down your desktop experience the same way the do your mobile experience, but they know this would spark outrage. so they only do it on mobile, where people are more used to not having a choice because the idea of phones being general-purpose computers rather than appliances is relatively new. to protect their power over you they spread scary stories about security and malware, which a lot of well-intentioned people sadly believe. so even apps that aren't trying to steal your data or fill your phone with ads end up with restrictions that are allegedly there to protect you"

Tactical Shooting is more like real combat training, and it works a bit differently.  For example, in Practical Shooting, you generally try to hit a target with a single bullet and then move to the next target.  In Tactical Shooting, you train to fire multiple rounds at each target.  In Practical Shooting, taking cover is far less important than with Tactical Shooting.  In Practical Shooting, all that matters is hitting targets, so you use your dominant hand; in Tactical Shooting, you actually practice firing with your off hand, in case you are injured and that's your only option.\nIn sum, Practical Shooting is more like sport, while Tactical Shooting is training a person to really use a firearm in combat."

        "natural_text": "The US Supreme Court decided that since people make mistakes, particularly cops, there should be a whoopsie card that can be played sometimes in civil court to protect the cop (or other public entity). Qualified Immunity can apply to any person acting under “color of law” to include school teachers, administrators, firefighters, and elected officials( and way more). Obviously it’s not a real card, but a theory and legal defense. You get the idea. The card can only be played in civil court, not criminal court. It can be requested to be played (by the cop or other person getting sued) and a judge (or judges) has to agree that it can be played. \nThe card can only played if someone’s civil rights were actually violated and those rights were not “clearly established” by law or legal precedent (precedent meaning it has been addressed in court before and a court made a legal decision on it already).\nThe card, when allowed to be played in court, says that, yes, a cop or some other public entity screwed up and made a mistake and violated someone’s civil rights. That  person that violated the rights won’t be held liable in a federal civil court (immune from lawsuit) because the screw up was something that was not clearly established already. In essence, that person made a reasonable mistake. \nWhen the Supreme Court came up with the idea of Qualified Immunity, it said that the idea was to protect people doing their jobs in good faith from being sued frivolously all the time. Meaning, a cop or some other public figure can do their jobs without being afraid of getting sued for anything and everything. Otherwise those public figures would not be able to do their job because they would get sued in civil court all the time for stupid stuff. The Supreme Court said that QI is not intended to be a blanket of protection for everything and does not cover cops (or others) who knowingly violate someone’s rights or reasonably should have known that those rights were clearly established. \nA lot of times this gets brought up in use of force cases where the question is whether a cop used excessive force. A lot of people get confused about QI and say the courts require that the exact situation has happened before and been addressed in court. Not really the case. The right to be free from excessive force (what the courts have said is considered a seizure under the 4th Amendment) has already been clearly established. \nQI is also often confused for indemnity. Indemnity or indemnification is separate and protects cops or other “color of law actors” from being held personally liable. That means if you sue a cop for something and are awarded money, that money is not paid by the cop directly. It’s usually paid by an insurance company that the police department pays for a policy to cover them. Like doctors who have to have malpractice insurance. If you sue a doctor, that money comes from their insurance company. \nThat’s a super broad explanation, there is a lot more to it but hope that helps."

Yes, they do occasionally happen, but the vast majority of prosecutors will go their entire careers without ever having filed an appeal.  In the exceedingly rare occasion when a prosecutor does file an appeal, its typically a once in a lifetime kind of deal.\n1) As far as sentencing goes, they can only appeal a sentence in which there is some obvious legal error.  This would be a case in which a sentence deviates from some sort of mandatory sentence - IE, the sentence is below a mandatory minimum sentence or falls outside of mandatory sentencing guidelines.  Prosecutors cannot appeal a sentence simply because they don't like it.\n2) Prosecutors cannot appeal a jury verdict.\n3) Prosecutors cannot appeal a judge's dismissal unless that dismissal was due to a misapplication of the relevant law.  This would be something like the judge ruling that the law in question was unconstitutional or ruling that the indictment against the defendant didn't state a cause of action when it did.  \n4) Prosecutors can appeal certain pre-trial procedural issues, such as the admissibility of evidence.  This has to happen before the trial actually starts.  Once the trial starts the prosecution has effectively waived any right it may have had to appeal pre-trial rulings.  \nAgain, a prosecution appeal of a pre-trial ruling is *much* rarer than it sounds.  Defendants don't have any obligation to the court and typically appeal any appealable issue, even if they don't have a good faith basis for the appeal.  Prosecutors *do* have obligations to the court and cannot appeal a pre-trial ruling unless they have a strong, good faith basis for believing that the ruling was in error and that the ruling *will* have effect the outcome of the trial.  \nIn other words, for a prosecutor to challenge a pre-trial ruling the judge had to get it really, incredibly wrong *and* it had to be concerning a major issue in the case, such as if a key witness would be allowed to testify."

This contrasts, for example, with someone who has entered the country illegally and then at some time in the future decides to claim asylum.\nNow you might spot several issues with this.\nFor example, let's say you're an Afghan woman who has been working unlawfully in the UK. Now the Taliban have taken over you decide, reasonably enough, to seek asylum. But a court is unlikely to decide that you had good reason to be in the UK.

While this was great news for renters in those places who were struggling financially, it was bad for the landlords who relied on that income to support themselves. \nThe Supreme Court recently ruled that the CDC had overstepped its authority by issuing the order and have overturned it.

        "natural_text": "Well, understand that \"Slumlord\" is a derogatory term used as catch all for bad landlords, it's not like there is a course in business school on slumlording. \nBut the term generally refers to the practice of renting low quality housing to low-income people and taking advantage of their desperation to avoid expense, for example necessary repairs, pest control, or preventative maintenance. \nIn other words, if you rent out a delipidated building and intentionally neglect any sort of required maintenance to the home with the knowledge that your tenants cannot find better housing so they are forced to accept below-standard living conditions, you are a slumlord."

        "natural_text": "A directed verdict is when a judge decides that based on the law the jury should not be asked to decide the case.  For example, if you are accused of murdering Joe Smith and Joe walks into court and says \"What's this all about, I'm not dead\".  The person not being dead is an absolute defense against murdering them, it doesn't matter what the other evidence is.  If it was a case of mistaken identity and now it seems you murdered somebody else, well that's another case and you'll have to be charged with that crime and have another trial.\nIn Kyle Rittenhouse's case, Kyle claims he shot someone in self defense.  The person didn't die and testified that he had raised his own gun and advanced upon Rittenhouse.  While this strengthens the \"self defense\" claim, it might not be the \"matter of law\" sort of thing that would lead to a directed verdict."

It's generally done as an agreement between the state and the accused as a way of lessening punishment.\nAnd on the flip-side, pleading not guilty doesn't mean you have to prove your innocence. It means you are forcing the state to prove your guilt. It's in their best interest to enforce the law (and the cops/prosecutors' best interests to have the appearance of actually catching crooks), so will make their case if they really feel you did it.

Well... oh no, it looks like your diplomat double parked in a super deadly danger zone, which we just created, and now she will be sent to jail for a hundred years. Perhaps you may want to reconsider your stance on imports from my country?\" So, there's an agreement that diplomats are immune to criminal charges, to keep them from being used as pawns that way.\nIf a diplomat causes an international incident, an actual crime that can be proven, then it becomes an issue for the two countries involved to resolve directly, rather than just the police. So basically, if a top diplomat commits a crime, they can't be arrested without potentially really pissing off another country, possibly starting a war. Now, if there is actual evidence and the two countries are on good terms, they will usually be able to work out a proper deal of \"Oh shit, our diplomat killed someone. Yeah, she's going to jail.

Sometimes Congress gives the acts that it passes names that are directly related to what the act does.  Sometimes they don't.  The Animal Welfare Act was not designed to regulate animal welfare.  \nThe Animal Welfare Act came about because the 1960's pet industry would sell off excess pets, mostly cats and dogs, to research facilities.  So if your local 1960's pet shop was selling kittens, once those kittens got too old to sell they would be shipped off to a medical lab.  The Animal Welfare Act was designed to stop that.\nAll the act does is to prohibit that practice and to establish a regulatory framework under which medical labs can be inspected to ensure that they're not using old pet animals for experimentation.  It only covers animals that were widely being sold as pets in the 1960's - most animals are not covered by it.\nIts not unusual for things like that to be regulated at the state level in the US.  The Federal Government rarely gets involved in traditional law enforcement actions and animal welfare/cruelty is a traditional law enforcement action."

The SCOTUS allowed reasonable restrictions on abortions in Casey, and many states have been pushing the limit on what is 'reasonable.'\nThe Texas legislature passed the most restrictive bill in recent memory. Abortions after 6 weeks are basically forbidden, which means that almost all women will be too far along for an abortion by the time they realize they are pregnant.\nHistorically, the SCOTUS has struck down laws like this that were overly restrictive, but in this case (in a 5-4 decision) the decided reject an emergency injunction - meaning the law is in effect until the larger case is heard.\nSo, for now, abortions are banned in Texas in every way that matters."

This is important because venues are carefully (well, ideally at least) rated by the fire department to determine how many can safely fit. It's hard to explain in a short reddit comment, but overcrowding can easily lead to a [crowd crush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes), where a large group of people begins to behave like a singular fluid mass and it becomes impossible for any individual to move normally. This commonly results in tramplings and suffocations, which is what killed all those people at Astroworld. \nScott also encourages his audiences to \"rage,\" which contributes to a culture of ignoring serious issues. At Astroworld, he continued to encourage this behavior even when an ambulance was making its way through the crowd. Although, in his defense, ambulances are not entirely uncommon at large events and he probably didn't fully understand what was happening.\nMy understanding is that this is not the first time something like this has happened at a Travis Scott concert, it's just the most severe incident, and that many other artists are much more conscientious about monitoring the crowds at their shows.

It takes awhile to get sorted. True story: Two twin brothers, both with bad raps, got busted for committing a crime together. It created such a problem at the local jail, that they moved one to a different facility in a neighboring parish (county).  At the next court date, they both appear before the judge and we notice that one of them got a prison tat’ of a cross right between his eyes. After court we all remarked, “Problem solved.”  I saw them both a few times after that for various court appearances, but at no time did the second brother get a matching tattoo. It is of no benefit to them in the long run, since it just delays the proceedings. In another case, it was two twin sisters. But only one of them had a criminal history. She kept using the “innocent“ sister‘s name and identification during arrests. The twin sister is probably still filing expungements and fighting with bureaucracy to keep her own name clear. But, after a time, because the criminal sister still operates in the same general locale, local law-enforcement became aware of the situation, and would realize the twin was telling the truth. What was more shocking is that the criminal sister looked like crap whenever she came to court, while the innocent one was always impeccably dressed and coherent. It became easy to tell them apart, and I only personally came across the two on one occasion. (25 years; Criminal Trial Attorney). 🚀"

Whether this is legal or not is still being chewed over, but at least at a practical level it’s very easy to get around biometric security if the person is physically present.\nAnother issue with biometrics - if somehow the biometric data is compromised and able to be replicated there’s no way for the user to change their biometric. I see u/cherryreddit mentioned Angela Merkel’s fingerprint - from now on she can’t use that biometric on anything, the information is compromised and able to be replicated. Compare to having a password compromised where you can quickly change it."

The gist of it is during rioting in Kenosha, WI one of Kyle’s friends was asked to provide security to a local business so that they would not have anymore property damage. Kyle was there to provide security and medical help if needed. During the night Kyle headed to a different location that the owners had to help with putting out fires. It was at this time he had some sort of run in with a Joshua Zaminski and Joseph Rosenbaum. Zaminski fired a shot in the air while Rosenbaum grabbed for Kyle’s rifle it was at this time that Kyle fired four shots hitting and killing Rosenbaum. A crowd was now gathering and started to chase Kyle. Kyle started to flee trying to turn himself into the police. He fell while running, was kicked in the head by an unsend assailant, he deflected a hit with a skate board by Anthony Huber. Huber also tried to wrestle the rifle away from Kyle, however Kyle fired one more time striking and killing Huber. It was when Kyle was getting up that a Mr. Grosskreutz approached Kyle. Kyle pointed his rifle at Grosskreutz but did not fire as Grosskreutz had his hands up. Grosskreutz then raised a pistol at Kyle who fired first hitting Grosskreutz in the arm. Kyle then left the scene looking to turn himself in. Kenosha police did not take him in, but the next morning he turned himself into the Antioch police. \nWith all that said the state had basically charged Kyle with murder for the two men he shot, attempted murd for Mr. Grosskreutz, reckless endangerment for firing a weapon at Grosskreutz, illegal possession  of a weapon by a minor, curfew violation. Those are things I remember off the top of my head. Kyle has claimed that he acted in self defense. So this trial is to determine Kyle’s guilt or innocence in this shooting."

        "prompt": "Q: Who is Kyle Rittenhouse and why is his trial a big thing?\nA:",
        "natural_text": "Answer:\nKeep in mind this is coming from someone without any formal legal background. This is a write up with facts from the trial. \nRittenhouse is a 17-year-old dude from Illinois. I forget what city, but it is quite close to the IL-WI border. He's worked in Kenosha, he has family and friends who live in Kenosha. I believe he said he gave money to an older friend of his (Dominic Black) to buy an AR rifle. This firearm never left the state of Wisconsin and was only ever possessed by Rittenhouse when Black was also present. On the 25th, Rittenhouse was given the rifle by Black.\nRittenhouse was not an EMT, however was an EMT cadet with his local fire department and had some basic EMT and medical training. He and several friends went to Kenosha essentially to look after the community after seeing the destruction the night before due to riots occurring because of the Jacob Blake shooting. An owner of a used car lot called Car Source asked for protection (from people he knew and ultimately became Rittenhouse and his friends) of his business after seeing every car burned at another location. They agreed and mostly remained around this location.\nDuring the day, Rittenhouse got a sling for his rifle so it was attached to his body. This made it so he would not have to set the rifle down or be able to be stolen while he gave someone medical attention or handled a fire extinguisher. Later, a police line essentially moved them from the Car Source. During the night, Rittenhouse and his accomplices put out dumpster fires and gave medical attention to some people with minor injuries.\nA man, Rosenbaum, was seen being very aggressive towards Rittenhouse and his accomplices. Rosenbaum even made threats at Rittenhouse twice. One time where he said something close to \"if I catch you alone I'll kill you.\" He also yelled (as a white man) \"shoot me n•••a! shoot me n•••a!\" At other similarly armed men. Rosenbaum also becomes angry and aggressive when a dumpster fire is put out. Later, Rittenhouse believes he is walking with a friend, but loses him, making him alone.\nThe first shots: Rittenhouse, alone, finds himself being chased by Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum yells \"fuck you!\" at him and throws what I believe is an empty plastic bag in his direction. A man nearby shoots 2 rounds into the air. Rittenhouse reacts, unsure where they came from, he turns towards Rosenbaum, who is charging Rittenhouse, and Rittenhouse points his rifle at Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum does not stop. Rittenhouse runs again, to find himself somewhat cornered because of some parked cars and other protestors. Rittenhouse stops when cornered and turns around, once turned around, Rosenbaum lunges at Rittenhouse, grabbing for his rifle. Rittenhouse fires 4 rounds very quickly one after another. These rounds killed Rosenbaum. You may hear that Rosenbaum was shot in the back. Although true, this is misleading. This round goes into his back entering his body closer to his head and the bullet goes down his body as if he was shot from above. This shot goes into his back this way because Rosenbaum is horizontal as he lunges at Rittenhouse and his body is lower than the rifle when this bullet is shot. I hope that makes sense. Rittenhouse stays for a brief second, and calls his friend, Black, for a few seconds to tell him he shot someone because he had to. His call was cut short when a mob begin to chase him while threatening him and throwing things at him. Of course, Rittenhouse runs away. Rittenhouse begins running towards the police line to turn himself in.\nAfter running down the street followed by a mob of angry, aggressive, and threatening demonstrators, Rittenhouse trips and falls due to being lightheaded from a combination of running and being struck in the head by a concrete rock. When having fallen down, an unknown man kicks Rittenhouse in the face. Rittenhouse fires 2 shots at him as he is being kicked, both miss, this man runs away.\nVery shortly after, Rittenhouse is struck in the back of the neck/upper back with a skateboard by a man named Huber. Huber sort of runs over Rittenhouse's prone body after this, while also grabbing for Rittenhouse's rifle. Rittenhouse fires a round into his chest as Huber is on top of him, proving fatal for Huber.\nSimultaneously, another man, Grosskreutz is running after Rittenhouse as well. Grosskreutz also has an illegally possessed handgun in his hand. Grosskreutz stops advancing towards Rittenhouse (once he is around 3-4 feet away) because of Rittenhouse's shot at Huber. This causes Grosskreutz to stop and put his hands up, still keeping his handgun in his hand. Rittenhouse sees him quickly after shooting Huber and points his rifle at Grosskreutz, which is also why Grosskreutz put his hands up. However, I believe (based on video) that since Grosskreutz stops and puts his hands up, Rittenhouse begins to slightly lower his rifle. Grosskreutz testified that Rittenhosue \"reracked\" (also known as rechambering) the rifle at this time. Rittenhouse disputed this in court and I believe video evidence shows that this never happened. Once Rittenhouse sort of slightly lowers his rifle, Grosskreutz (to his own admission and testimony) lunges at Rittenhouse and points his handgun at Rittenhouse's head. Rittenhouse is quick enough to shoot Grosskreutz before Grosskreutz is able to advance any further. He hits Grosskreutz's bicep, damaging his arm severely. Grosskreutz runs away seeking medical attention and lives to tell the story. For this shooting, I want to emphasize (because this is pretty key) that Grosskreutz admitted in his testimony that Rittenhouse did not shoot him until he lunged at Rittenhouse, dropped his arms, and pointed his handgun at Rittenhouse.\nRittenhouse gets up and advances towards the police, putting his hands up when he approaches trying to turn himself in. The officer (who is in his squad car) who is being approached by Rittenhouse, orders Rittenhouse to stay back, pepper sprays Rittenhouse, and tells Rittenhouse to go home. Rittenhouse goes home in Illinois where he explained to his mother what happened. Rittenhouse goes to his local police station to turn himself in, driven by his mother. He arrives at the police station less than an hour after the shooting.\nThe big thing part comes in protecting self defense as this case could cause precedent."

One of them, a convicted 9 time child molester with a history of serious mental illness who had been released from a psychiatric hospital that morning, charged Rittenhouse and grabbed his gun.  Rittenhouse shot him.\nA mob then chased Rittenhouse several blocks.  He was then knocked to the ground by a second rioter with a history of violent crime.

Immigrants often tend to be younger than the average citizen, and if they can move into the country and then have children it can be doubly beneficial in increasing the young population of a country.\nImmigrants also might be skilled, and the country they immigrate to gets the benefit of those skills while having paid none of the costs to educate the immigrant.  Another possibility for advantage.\nOn the flip side, some immigrants are refugees from disastrous failed states which have not prepared them with valuable skills.

Social workers help the family sign up for benefits like food stamps, find programs that might provide child care or respite, and just generally has tools to get patients the resources they might need.\nThe three are like three circles in a Venn diagram.

Williams. Williams was an escaped mental patient who kidnapped and murdered a ten-year old in Iowa in 1968. He surrendered to police a few days later in another county. While being transported back, the detectives asked him to reveal where the body was, and he took them to it. He was later convicted, but the Supreme Court later ruled in 1977 that his right to council (sixth amendment) had been violated and reversed the conviction. At the retrial, the prosecution successfully argued that a search party was already looking in that area and would have found the body with or without Williams' cooperation, and Williams was convicted again.

To me it seems so effective and instant that you would feel much at all, unlike the other methods that we still use.\nA:",
        "natural_text": "The guillotine is actually a quite modern and humane method of execution. It is quick and reliable. There were some reports from the executions during the French revolution indicating that the persons may have been alive after the executions but these have been debunked, although the myth is still propagated. The guillotine were in use up until 1977 when executions were abolished as a form of punishment in the countries using it. But it is still a method considered for executions even today.\nThe issue with the guillotine is that it is quite bloody which can be quite grusome for the people watching as well as those who have to clean up afterwards. But for the executed it is one of the best way to do it. Other countries used the long drop hanging method which is also instant but does not pierce the skin and therefore is less grusome. The problem with the long drop is that it requires more experience by the executioner as if the length of rope or the weight is wrong then it can result in strangling or decapitation. And today only a handful of people in the world have performed the long drop and none of them can be considered to be experienced.\nLethal injection is maybe the best way to perform executions although the process does take a lot longer then other method which can be considered as cruel in itself. Gas chambers is not as reliable and also does take a long time as well as dangerous for the executioners, it is very unpractical way of execution except for mass executions. Firing squads are a very practical easy way of execution by militaries as the tools are readily available. However it is quite unreliable and it is not uncommon for the executed to live for minutes after being shot, maybe only dying from a mercy shot to the head afterwards."

You can sue someone for anything but the court can throw it out if you lack the standing.

This may still be a moot point since the fetus is not legally a person under the law and the court cannot possibly provide some sort of redress or payment to make this better.\nIn the end though...

Having the drugs be illegal to use ends up saddling a lot of people with criminal records that limit their access to education and employment - often perpetuating the conditions that led to a person taking the drugs to start with, and it drives the sales of the drugs to criminal organizations, dragging users into dealings with people committing other crimes. It also makes it more difficult for users to seek treatment for drug use, and limits treatment options.\nDecriminalizing drugs remove many of these harms, making it easier for those who want help to access it, and reducing the number of people who get formally marginalized by society due to criminal records who wind up taking drugs because their life has entered a new level of suckage.\nIt also takes away some of the “glamor” of drug use, presenting it as an illness, where people are sick and getting treated in a clinical setting, rather than having it be some sort of edgy and rebellious thing teenagers do."

        "natural_text": "The Constitution grants Congress the power “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes”.  But under the original interpretation of this clause, they couldn’t restrict commerce inside of a single state.  \nThis is why both the abolition of slavery and the prohibition of alcohol were done via constitutional amendment. Congress simply didn’t have the power to do so otherwise.\nThis changed with *Wickard v. Filburn*.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn\nThe basics of the case:\n>An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The US government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone \"interstate\" commerce\nThe Supreme Court disagreed.\n>The Court decided that Filburn's wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn's production.\nThis interpretation of the Commerce Clause granted Congress *way* more power to regulate the economy, since almost anything could be considered interstate commerce under the reasoning SCOTUS used in this case. \nThat reasoning is why Congress can, for example, criminalize the production and use of drugs like marijuana or heroin with legislation rather than requiring a constitutional amendment.\n*United States v. Lopez* somewhat curtailed this broad view of interstate commerce, but not much.  *Gonzales v. Raich* upheld the view of marijuana grown at home for personal use as being interstate commerce, for example."

        "prompt": "Q: Why are prison sentences stacked upon each other?\nA:",
        "natural_text": "You can serve time “concurrently” or “consecutively” for multiple convictions. Someone serving concurrent 2-year sentences for burglary and weapons possession should in theory be out of jail in two years.  Someone serving a consecutive sentence for the same thing would in theory be out in four years. \nNow what people don’t know is that in some areas you get “credit” for every hour you don’t cause trouble in jail. So if you don’t cause trouble for an hour, you get credit for an additional hour of jail time.  So in the previous concurrent example the convict would be out in just one year and in the consecutive example he would be out in two years. \nHow the sentences are handed down is often dictated by state sentencing guidelines. The judge has a series of checks that determine the length of sentence and how it is to be served. If there is a prior criminal past that pushes the sentencing one way and if there is no history then it pushes it the other way. Things like employment, family in the community, job, home ownership, etc. can also play a role in sentencing.  \nFor most serious crimes parole or early release is also possible if a percentage of the sentence has been served (I believe like 75-85%).   So after 8.5 years of a 10-year sentence someone could be eligible for early release.  In particularly heinous crimes, or frequent convictions, the sentences are designed to prevent early release by assigning more years to a sentence and making it a consecutive sentence rather than concurrent.  \nSo a child rapist who accidentally kills their victim might only have gotten convicted for second degree murder, or maybe even just manslaughter.  Those would have significantly fewer years of potential punishment than first degree murder.  So for the rape the guy might only get 5-years and for manslaughter he’d get maybe 10-years. All total he could serve as little as just 5-years (remember he gets an hour of credit for every hour he serves with no trouble) and if the 5 and 10 year sentences are served concurrently then he would be out in no time. \nBy making the sentences consecutive he would serve as little as 7.5 years and as many as 15. \nBut a lot of it has to do with prior criminal history."

        "natural_text": "I imagine that you are thinking of the recent Arbery trial.\nThe accused did not face four counts of murder, but felony murder. Felony murder is when someone dies as a result of you doing something illegal. Different places define law differently, but that is the general gist of it. If you rob a bank, and someone dies as result, that is felony murder on your part, regardless if you did the actual killing yourself.\nIn this case, there are four counts of felony murder because they committed four separate felonies, all which resulted in death. There were two charges of assault, one of kidnapping, and one of criminal attempt to commit a felony. Since Arbery died, each of those acts contributed to his death, and thus are each open to a felony murder charge. Not all of the accused were found guilty on all of them. For example, one of them was found not guilty on one of the assault charges, and thus also not guilty for the corresponding felony murder charge (but they were fond guilty of the other three felonies and other three felony murder charges).\nIn addition to the felony murder charges, they also faced a single charge of murder, which accounts for killing that single person."

        "prompt": "Q: Why Does It Take So Long Between a Prisoner Getting Sentenced to Death and Being Executed?\nA:",
        "natural_text": "It depends on the state.  \nCalifornia, for example, will sentence people to death, but the governor has to actually order the execution to be carried out and none have in 15 years.  So when you get sentenced to death in California you go to death row, but never actually get executed because the governor never orders that to happen.\nIn other states its typically more of an issue of the types of appeals afforded to death penalty cases.  In a non-death penalty case you cannot typically introduce new evidence on appeal.  The only thing your appeal can concern is some error that occurred at trial.  You also only get one (1) appeal.  After that you can file something called a \"habeas motion\" but courts aren't obligated to hear those and most just shove them in a drawer and forget about them.  However, most states allow death penalty cases to appeal on the basis of new evidence.\nWhat this means is that if you claim to have any sort of new evidence that's relevant to your case, a court will stay your execution while it evaluates whatever it is that you've produced.  Getting a decision on that new evidence often takes a year or two, during which time you can't be executed.  The burden for what qualifies as new evidence is non-existent.  *Anything* that you purport to prove your innocence counts.  \nSomeone who wasn't born at the time of the murder but now claims they saw someone else do it?  That's new evidence.  DNA evidence that shows a mere 99.99999% chance that you committed the crime?  There's a .00001% chance that the DNA came from someone else so that's new evidence that the court *has* to consider before you can be executed.  Once they've denied your appeal, you get to keep appealing so long as you can continue to produce new evidence.\nThere are plenty of organizations that go out and actively find new witnesses or pay for additional evidence testing to stall out death penalty cases, so its often possible to stall out an execution until your right to appeal on the basis of new evidence is cut off.  *Typically* most states cut you off after either 5 or 10 years from the date of your conviction, so that's the point at which whatever administrative process is necessary to execute you begins moving foward.  \nSome states have shorter or longer cut offs, but typically when you see death row inmates dying of natural causes its because you're either in a California situation, where the death penalty exists in name only, or in a state that has a really long cut off for death row inmates being able to appeal their conviction on the basis of new evidence."

If you're arguing to \"win\" some imaginary battle and aren't intending to give your opponent a fair shake, that's bad faith. If you intentionally misrepresent your evidence, lie, cheat, divert the discussion away from areas that you don't have the upper hand, that's bad faith.\nQuestions asked in bad faith work in the same way. Generally one asks a question because they'd like to know the answer, or rhetorically they ask them as a way to highlight some point or argument and get those present to view the discussion in a different light.

This is called premeditation.  It means that you intend to kill them - you are trying to kill them.  It’s complete, evil, cold blooded murder.\n2nd-degree murder = when you intentionally kill someone without premeditation.   So, you don’t actually have that thought, “I’m going to kill this person,” but you still shoot them in the face.   \n3rd-degree murder is when your actions guarantee the death of a person, but you did not necessarily intend death to occur.   You have to “act with a depraved mind and malice”\nManslaughter is very similar to 3rd-degree murder, but the difference is the frame of mind of the person committing the crime.  That “depraved mind and malice” is not present here.  A person who commits manslaughter does commit an act that unintentionally guarantees the death of a person, but it is not with malice.  Drunk driving is a classic example of this.\nNegligent homicide is when someone causes a death through criminal negligence.

First, who is to say a warning shot isn't just a targeted shot that missed? Second, the very fact that you fire a shot puts the person you are warning in fear or his or her life, for good reason. Indeed, that's the intent of the warning shot. So it's still an assault, even if it's not a fatal one.

Thus if one player is down or in a headlock or otherwise vulnerable they will break it up.\nSo you may see two enforcers in the NHL agree to fight, square off as the refs watch, and exchange punches (often while holding each other’s sweaters since boxing on skates isn’t easy).

That has implications for Disney in any future lawsuit in which the family claims that Disney is infringing on the family's copyrights.  \nIt also might make other companies concerned about working with Disney on any Marvel works.  If Disney is, in fact, infringing on the family's copyrights then you, as an unrelated company doing business with Disney, are no longer an innocent bystander in all of this but, rather, an active copyright infringer who can also be sued.\nAlthough Disney filed a lawsuit they're not asking for money.  They're asking a court to review the situation and confirm that they are, in fact, the legal owners of the Marvel copyrights in question.  This provides certainty to everyone involved.  For Disney, it prevents them from being sued 20 years from now and then owing money for every Marvel movie they've made in between.

Later I. 2020 it’s revealed brittany’s lawyers could have filed a petition to end the conservatorship but it would mean a psych-eval which seemed to have been a deal breaker. \nThis year has mostly been a battle of replacing her father in the conservatorship and finally winning the right to choose her own lawyer (she was unable to fire them and had the same lawyer for 13 years. \nTLDR: Either she really needed the conservatorship for a time, or like 6-7 individuals (Jamie, judge Goetz, Ingram (brittany’s lawyer), brittany’s fiancé to name a few) Did some conspiracy level manipulating of the system for various reasons.\nBillboard has a decent timeline of events\nhttps://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/9445409/britney-spears-conservatorship-timeline/"

        "natural_text": "An extradition treaty is a formalized agreement (usually for both sides) to extradite people who are wanted in the other country for certain types of crimes. Either country can always decide to extradite, but they may have to justify it internally (does the legal code allow them to arrest someone who has not broken any local laws?). The extradition treaty just gets the legal work done ahead of time (eg, explicitly allows the police to arrest someone who has not broken any local laws, but has broken any of the laws listed in the extradition treaty while in the other country)."

Previously memorization was the main mechanic, instead of conceptualization of numbers. If you didn't have it memorized you had no tools to fall back on. Now students are taught to visualize and decompose numbers to make operations like these easy to do mentally.\nThis can be fixed, but it will take a little training and effort. Fortunately that's not super difficult for an adult to achieve in a few weeks (assuming there's no learning disability). You just have to practice things like decomposing numbers into 10s. Eg your example 77+79 could be 70+70+7+9. 70+70 is 140. 7+9 is 16. 140+16 is now a pretty easy operation. Decomposition of numbers into groups is a very useful skill for doing mental math."

Now France didn't like the US having so much say in their economy, and tried to exchange back some of their US dollars for gold with the US government.  But the US didn't want to do that, so they went off the gold standard.

It isn’t very liquid since you have to put it on the market snd that can take a while. So if you need money quickly, this won’t help you…assuming you want full value of it and not giving it at a discount. \nLiquidate is to completely turn an asset into cash. You own 10 shares of a company? You sell 10 shares? You’ve liquidated. Sell a car? You liquidated your car. \nYou sell the house? Liquidated that asset as you no longer have it, and instead have cash.\nAlso, how liquid something is relative to how quickly you need the cash. Let’s say you own a Rolex worth 15k.

Then that leads to job and wage cuts. That also leads to decreased stock values. I’m not sure if prices for everything tend to go up. But prices for certain goods normally do, and the increased prices for staple goods normally hurt the most because they’re things people regularly need but have a harder time paying for (gas, food, etc.). Some industries get hit harder than others like tourism and recreation because people don’t have extra money to spend to do things aside from the necessities to keep their household afloat. But other sectors have sinking prices like cars and homes because the market is either flooded or stagnated with excess as less people buy them which also sinks values for companies and for assets like houses that people may have investments in.

At first glance it may seem that the total value should remain the same, but it doesn't. \nAs an exaggerated example, let's say the trading pair is BERT and ERNIE, and at the moment you create the BERT-ERNIE liquidity pool, both BERT and ERNIE are valued in other markets at $5 each. Let's say you put 10 BERT and 10 ERNIE in the pool. You contributed $50 + $50 = $100 of value to the pool. \nThen I buy 1 ERNIE from the pool, paying 1 BERT for it. Now the pool has 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT. If you were to withdraw your liquidity now, would the 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT you'd receive be worth as much as the 10 ERNIE and 10 BERT you deposited? Clearly the market has more demand for ERNIE than it does for BERT (as evidenced by the trade), so maybe ERNIE is now worth $5.50 while BERT is now worth $4.50. The pool, and your claim to it, is worth 9×$5.50 + 11×$4.50, or $99. Your impermanent loss (or divergence loss) is $1.\nPeople call it \"impermanent loss\" because the lost value can come back if sentiment for that trading pair swings the other way.

We can mine it, sure, but the more of it we mine the harder it is to find new mines, and we don't own the entire world's gold supply. \nWorse, as our technology advanced, we started finding uses for gold that were really important.\nSo it was really clear we were going to constantly have more money than there is gold, which would mean we'd have to constantly adjust how money converts to and from gold. Financial people like the value of their money to be relatively constant, so this would be a disaster. \nSo we thought about the problem and asked ourselves if society really *needed* our money to be backed by a real good, or if people trusted the United States enough to take the money at face value. It turned out most of the world was happy with this arrangement.

Even if the item is made in the US (example, cereal) the packaging most likely was made from something coming from China be it the ink for the printer or the plastic inserts that the cereal goes into. \nThere are four issues going on with imports right now.\n1. COVID shut manufacturing & the ports in China for a long time. Once things started to resume they had to fill back orders. This caused issues at the ports & with logistic services that take products to the ports to ship.\n2. Ports have a LOT of cargo to deal with & have only so many people. If there’s still reduction of employees working then that will contribute to issues at port. That backlog of products being moved is causing major, major delays around the world. In California, for example, just recently there were hundreds of ships waiting to get into port & it caused a bit of a [traffic jam on the ocean.](https://www.marketplace.org/2021/09/17/floating-traffic-jam-at-california-ports-sets-record/)3. The Evergreen ship Ever Given also contributed to the world wide mess at the ports. They were stuck blocking the Suez Canal in Egypt & there’s absolutely no way for ships to turn around & go back so there were thousands of ships stuck for weeks. Some ships opted to go around Africa which added weeks to their routes. All those delays to all those ships resulted in shortages around the world then coupled with backlogs of ships that couldn’t get into port plus COVID.\n4. Local supply issues. Certain items are harder to come by due to supply issues. Chicken for the last few months have been scarce because farmers opted to cull chickens last year due to not being able to process them & have scaled back for the time as they can’t get it processed due to labor shortages at processing plants or COVID. We’ll continue to see fresh meat, seafood, & produce to be higher in prices & less selections for at least another year."

It's value climbs to $100B but he only pays taxes on gains when he sells. So even as his stock has gained 10's of billions in value over the past year, he isn't taxed on that. Let's say he sells $10m worth of shares to cover living expenses, he pays capital gains taxes on that, which are lower than income taxes at top income bracket -- only 20% for incomes over $441k. So in this example, assuming Bezos' shares had 0 cost basis, his $10m sale would trigger a $2m tax bill. Not nothing, but basically a rounding error vs. his wealth.\nThe other way that some wealthy reduce taxable income is through a business. By deducting expenses \"for the business\" they can cut their taxable income and buy things with pre-tax dollars. Say you're a dentist who wants to vacation in Hawaii... find a Dental Conference going on there, attend and tack on a vacation after the conference -- deduct some of the hotel, meals, all the airfare, etc. to cut your true cost of vacationing in Hawaii.

        "natural_text": "Inflation is a very complex issue. It's one of the reasons it's so hard to entirely stop. People like to blame inflation on the idea that we make print too much money, but it's more complex than just that. The current inflation spike we're seeing is, like many other things in the world today, because of covid and the the supply and demand problem.\nIn Economics 101 you learn of supply and demand. If there is a high supply and low demand for a good, the price of each individual good will be low. If there is high demand and low supply, the price for each individual good will be higher.\nFor the past year and a half consumers haven't been spending as much money. If people don't buy things, companies make less of them and stores stock less of them. (ie \"low demand\") However, people are now returning to old spending patterns, but the production has been slow to adjust. So the demand for goods has gone up without the supply to match it, thus the price of each individual good has gone up.\nThe second factor for the current inflation spike is a consequence of the governments efforts to keep the economy afloat when people weren't buying as much. Mainly this was done by the fed lowering interest rates to near 0%. That's a complex topic in and of itself as to what that actually means. However, for our purposes all you need to know is that near 0 interest rate means that people are taking out loans, primarily mortgages, to take advantage of the low interest and gain property. Unfortunately, the housing market is also limited which drives up the price for each home. \nAll this combines to make the current purchasing power of a dollar less than what it was, or at least make the market see it as such. That's not to say you should go out and try and buy things that hold their value. This kind of temporary inflation will normalize and it already has started to; at least in the housing market."

        "natural_text": "Car sales are really weird.  Car dealerships are not owned by the car companies.  The dealerships buy cars from the manufacturer, and then sell them to individuals like you.  If they don't sell all the cars they buy, then they are loosing money paying for cars sitting on the dealership lot.  Every dealership is different, but many operate on a quota system, where each salesman is assigned a number of cars to sell during a certain period, say 50 cars per month.  Salesmen will be paid a percentage of the cost of each sale, plus a bonus if they sell the car for a relatively high price.  If a salesman is behind their target near the end of the month, they will be more desperate to sell the car, and may be willing to give up their high price bonus in order to meet their sales quota.  That said, not all dealerships operate on a quota system, and even if they do, there is no reason to believe that the quota countdown ends at the end of the month, it could be on the 15th, or the 5th, or whenever.  \nThe non-ELI5 answer is a lot more complicated, as there are different incentives for selling cars at the manufacturer, dealership, and salesman level, any or all of which will contribute to how willing they are to make you a good deal."

This is majority of US GDP, about 70%.\n2) Business Investment. This is businesses buying software, equipment, new factories, etc. This also includes people building new houses, but not people buying existing houses. It also includes \"changes in private inventory\" which is a fancy way of saying \"do you have more stuff in your warehouse.\" This is about 20% of US GDP.\n3) Government spending. This is ALL government spending, from sophisticated fighter jets to the snow plow guy in your town.  This is about 15% of GDP. Wait, that's 105%? Well, last is....\n4) Net exports (or imports). All of the stuff you send to other countries minus the stuff other countries send you. Because the US is shifting to a service economy, and services are really hard to export, we are a net importer. This is -5% of US GDP.\nSo what isn't included? Anything that was produced outside of the US. Anything that is being resold (like houses or Craigslist), transfer payments from the government (like welfare or food stamps), things that are only made to be parts of other things (aka intermediate goods), financial trades (sorry, r/WSB),  and last but not least: the black market.

It’s been the UK’s second-largest party since the late 20s, though the Conservative party has held power for the majority of this period. Labour went through major changes in the 90s, which many would say turned it from a socialist to a neoliberal party, favouring free markets and very limited government intervention in the economy. 1997-2010 was the longest period of Labour government; Labour have not been in government since.\nThe party still has close links to unions and remains to the left of the Conservative party, but in the present day it’s a centrist party. The majority of members and elected officials in the centre or centre-left, the membership leaning a bit further left/socialist, and MPs more economically liberal. \nIn policy terms the party favours a stronger welfare system, slightly increased public ownership. Labour has generally been in favour of more government spending over the last decade. It’s somewhat more socially liberal than the Conservative party, but still competes with them to be ‘tough on crime’. Labour is also committed to a “strong” defence policy and nuclear weapons.

        "natural_text": "There are two major ways to calculate investment returns. Okay, there's dozens, but specifically with regard to your question what you're looking for is the difference between \"time-weighted\" and \"money-weighted\" returns. There are multiple formulas to determine both, and each have their uses. Each dollar you put in or take out is weighted to come out to an aggregate performance number, and it'll look different based on how you weight the dollars in/out. The general difference is that time-weighted return does not factor in the timing of additions/withdrawals, while money-weighted return does. Said another way, time-weighted return shows the return of an investment, money-weighted return shows the return of YOUR investment in that same thing.\nHere's an example. Let's say you buy ABC stock with $10K, then six months later ABC has fallen 50%. On that date, you add an additional $5K and buy ABC stock with it. Over the next six months, ABC rises 100%. If it goes down 50%, it has to rise 100% to get back to even, so ABC's return is flat over this year, and thus your return is also flat on the $10K. But, your return on the additional $5K is 100%. Time-weighted return strips out that lucky timing and measures only the performance of ABC, so your total time-weighted return is still flat on the whole $15K. But, your money-weighted return will be much higher than 0% because the return on the $5K was 100% and it isn't adjusted for.\nIf you didn't make any additions, then your money- and time-weighted returns will be the same. Since you've been contributing regularly, these two weighting methods will produce significantly different total return figures."
