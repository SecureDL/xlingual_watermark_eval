Such a turnaround would trigger yet another round of liquidity issues for banks, especially in Europe, with no good news on the horizon.\nAll that being said, the euro should likely climb higher in the coming days as the ECB comes to the bailout aid of Spain and Portugal with liquidity. In a worst case scenario, the ECB can also act as a backstop for banks in need of liquidity as well. The Spanish and Portuguese stock markets will likely close in green tomorrow, but we'll be watching the situation in Europe like a hawk.\n\nThe market saw two other items yesterday -- the dollar index rose to a new eight week",

This June, the Washington Post reported it had killed more than 4 million animals through poisoning, snaring and shooting in 2013 alone.\nBut from year to year, the number of animals killed by the program fluctuates significantly, from 1.5 to 5 million. In 2008, 5 million animals were killed while over the next four years it was 3 million.The number is not rising, as Wildlife Services suggests, causing critics to question their justification for their methods.\nSo far, their secretive approach has gone relatively unnoticed. Now, the Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians are trying to change that.",

In both cases, the report found, it failed to do that.\n\n\"The agency in fact admitted that it did not have any documentation relating to either kill order,\" Zuardo said. \"This is not acceptable. It is clear to me that our wildlife services have gone beyond negligent—and are now showing willful indifference to a federal law and the rights of wildlife.\"\n\nIn Louisiana, at least 19 animals have been illegally killed by the agency since 2016, Zuardo told Mother Jones.

As long as the USDA has an unregulated and unaccountable wildlife services program, there's no way of knowing how animals are treated there or how many are killed.\n\nI agree with J.D. that the problem isn't as much with the wildlife services themselves (although this would be a really good place for a few FOIA searches). The main challenge is that a lot of wildlife populations out there are highly endangered, and therefore are a pain in the ass for the ag industry.\n\nFor example, the cougar.

Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved.

How (or even if) these two observations—the hot spot and the neruexin flaws—fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn’t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention.

Epidemics happen because of new, wild, aggressive disease strains, but they also happen for lack of prevention. More to the point, just because you can afford to miss work or buy medication when you get sick doesn’t mean others can.\nIn the same way you don’t not vote because nothing is bothering you specifically, you don’t not get the flu shot because you are very likely to survive it yourself.

It asks for self-reflection about one's motives, desires, expectations, etc., and for a reckoning with them. Vaccine hesitancy is not about conspiracy theories, or racism, or displeasure at public schools, or any of the usual suspects, but, as I have argued, is instead about how humans want to live in freedom.\n\nAnd so, for me, the question becomes this: is freedom only about having the choices, or is it perhaps also about having an accountability for the choices that one makes?

The depth of detail is commendable, as it explores the philosophical implications of freedom and responsibility regarding vaccination choices. The writing is clear and coherent, with a logical flow that guides the reader through the argument. The originality is notable, as it challenges common narratives surrounding vaccine hesitancy.

The information presented is accurate and aligns with current discussions on vaccine hesitancy. \n\n**Summary for LLM B:**  \nLLM B's response is less relevant to the prompt, as it diverges into a discussion about measles and a vaccination for bovine tuberculosis, which does not directly address the individual responsibility aspect of vaccine hesitancy.

Another option is an analytical database system, such as Cognos Big Data, EMC Greenplum, or Oracle Exadata, which are built for Hadoop. These can be expensive, but can scale up with performance needs. Analytics have not yet been adopted by large organizations because of the high cost. Finally, an H-Store-like architecture can be implemented with custom-code optimizations, but this is only practical for an Hadoop implementation with a small number of machines.\n\nQ) How do you see the future of analytics in Hadoop and MapReduce?\n\nA) MapReduce is not the right paradigm for handling large datasets in Hadoop, for the reasons discussed above. Big data is more likely going the data store way, with MapReduce on top, and the H-Store technique (Hive + Hbase) or other analytic databases (Cognos BigData",

For instance, Simon said that more and more research funding is coming in at the local level, not from the national government—a “systemic change,” he termed it. And while many Western companies opened their research labs in China initially because the government effectively made it a condition for selling goods in the country, said Sun, they are increasingly producing interesting work.

'Stuck at home': UK coronavirus lockdown\nBBC Radio 4; 2 hrs 17 mins\nA new home-made reality show in the UK offers citizens stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic a chance to watch other people trapped in their houses.  The reality show is part of a public health campaign to encourage isolation among those who have come down with Covid-19 or are caring for those who have.  But whether it works could ultimately depend on whether the media is prepared to present a less sanitised version of home than the one created for viewing.  The documentary follows members of a family of four, living in a house so small two of them have to sleep in adjoining rooms.  When asked if he had any tips for his countrymen and women stuck at home, Mr O'Connor replied: \"A little human interaction, to get people talking is critical in helping them through this.\" 'Stay inside'\nImage copyright Getty Images",

        "natural_text": "whatever was not assumed was not healed\". In that we understand the danger of the denial of the sacred humanity of Jesus. Redemption would not be complete.\nThe Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD dealt with this threat to the meaning and implications of the Incarnation of the Word of God. The creed of the Council of Chalcedon declared that Jesus Christ is one person who exists \"in two natures\" - a divine nature and a human nature - which are neither confused (\"blended together\" into a third nature) nor divided or separated. Jesus is fully God and truly and fully human. Thus, the first four ecumenical Councils defined the meaning of the most foundational belief of the Christian faith and, as a result preserved the great promise of that faith for each one of us. In these Councils, as in the Second Vatican Council, what was said about Mary ensured the continued proclamation of the fullness of the truth about Jesus Christ.",

By \"only a human appearance\", Gregory of Nazanzen meant Christ was only in the human appearance.\n\nThe first Ecumenical Council of Constantinople of 451 accepted the Nicene Creed, a very general statement. The council did not clarify in detail all the doctrines which were declared by the Council of Nicea. In 553 the Second Ecumenical council of Constantinopole clarified the dogma when stating that there was no distinction or union of the two natures. The Fifth Ecumenical which took place in 571 explicitly stated that the two nibiru's were completely different and that they were united in one person. The sixth ecumenical council was held to undo the later condemnations of Eutyches because Eutyches had been exiled to the East. In 681, the Council of Rome said that the divinity of Jesus",
        "watermarked_sample": "the Lord was not in two natures, but he is one nature\". But such a position was considered heretical at the time, so this could never become the mainstream position of the churches. However, the notion that there were two natures within Jesus also went against the central belief that one of the most basic of the Nicene Creed that \"it was not possible for God the Son, who alone is eternal, and who is almight, and who was with the Father from eternity, be born of a woman\".\n\nSuch a view was clearly against the understanding that the Jesus of the Gospels was totally God as well as wholly human. If he were merely human, the miracles would not have taken place. And the resurrection at the end of the Bible would have been superfluous. Yet, there was also a problem with the view that Jesus was fully divine, from the standpoint of theology. To assume God the Son was fully divine required a theological",

Of those, four (five if we include Bernier, who briefly sat as an Independent before changing his affiliation to the People's Party) are now sitting in the House of Commons. That's twice the largest number of \"honourable members\" that ever sat previously as independents at the same time.\nThat's a coincidence, of course: very little connects former cabinet ministers Tootoo and Clement to Philpott and Wilson-Raybould, apart from the bad view they now have in the House.

The Canadian Alliance, launched in 2003, was able to gain official status as an opposition party in the House, but not in the Senate. Its role was thus akin to that of a minor political party; as such, the party needed just seven or eight MPs to have enough votes to put its amendments on the order paper. After its merger with the PCs, then, the party no longer had those MPs, nor the votes required to force the Liberals' hand on matters of party procedure. In effect, the party disappeared from the House; it was only in the Senate that its MPs continued, if in an incandescently faint way. Thus, the Conservative party of today is what remains",

But Newfoundland's not alone — this is also a country still dominated by the institutions of empire, which was built by the very people we're now seeing leave the fold — a few at a time, but a few nonetheless.\nIf this is, as the election so often says, a referendum on something, it appears it's a referendum on Newfoundland.

Higher the rating, the more effective is the home's insulation. \"To help a homeowner understand this term, imagine taking three layers of bubble wrap, like a huge, paper-thin insulation, and then putting it inside the home.

It represents an American citizen’s engaging in peaceable, voluntary exchange, through intermediaries, with a German auto producer.

In this context, Congressman Paul Gillmor (from Nebraska) was quoted saying that \"…he is pleased the Trump Administration is imposing steel and aluminum duties, that this is what his constituents want…\" And then just to show how ridiculous this is, Gillmor's own district is home to companies like Bechtel, one of the largest corporations in the world which makes its money principally in the construction business, of which steel and aluminum are major components.\n\nWhat's the real point here?

What makes that even more impressive is that Marathon is growing at a faster pace without increasing capital spending.\nWhile the slump in oil prices will cut into Marathon's cash flow, the company remains well positioned to handle lower oil prices.
