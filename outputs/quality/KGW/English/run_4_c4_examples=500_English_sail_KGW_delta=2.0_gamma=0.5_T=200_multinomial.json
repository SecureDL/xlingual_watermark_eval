Most sensors and optical readers use optical sensors and are able to detect a wide variety of shapes and patterns. Some optical and capacitative fingerprints are capable of working with larger, bulkier objects or materials, but they are still not as accurate as conventional fingerprint scanners.\n\n## Will I be able to see and read fingerprints on the keyboard?\n\nNo, you should not be able to see or read fingerprints on the keyboard due to the fact that fingerprint recognition involves a very specific set of patterns and techniques, and does not involve any physical means of detecting fingerprints. Instead, they use data that identifies the shape of each digit and the thickness of the fingers.\n\n",

The depth of detail is moderate, with some descriptions of the music but lacking in specific insights. Clarity is average, as some sentences are convoluted and difficult to follow. The logical flow is somewhat disjointed, making it hard to connect ideas. Originality is present but not particularly striking, and specific examples are used but not effectively. The accuracy of information is acceptable, but the lack of depth and clarity detracts from the overall quality.\n\n**Summary of LLM B's Response:**  \nLLM B's response is more relevant to the prompt, focusing on the emotional impact of the performances and the singer's struggles. The depth of detail is greater, as it discusses the singer's technical challenges and the emotional weight of the songs. Clarity is good, with a more straightforward writing style that effectively conveys the message. The coherence and logical flow are strong, as the ideas build upon each other well. Originality is evident in the insights about the singer's performance and emotional state. Specific examples are used effectively, particularly in discussing the song \"What You'll Miss.\" The accuracy of information is also high, as it reflects a clear understanding of the performance context.\n\nGiven the evaluations, LLM B demonstrates a stronger overall performance compared to LLM A. \n\n[[B]]: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]"

This can be seen, for example in the word “hors” for horse, which has not replaced the French word for horse.\nHowever, the French still have many words which are used in everyday conversation. However, for many of the words to have been in use for centuries, they are in the Old French language and have not yet been adopted into the present day English language. Thus, these old words are more likely to be associated with a different kind of people, such as a foreigner, and are rarely used in everyday conversations.\n“France has a strong population of native speakers and people of French descent, mainly in the south.

In these days, it’s the same for all.” ​\nBut it doesn’t mean that Mr Monlord doubts the importance of speaking an effective French.\n“I always taught French as my first language when it was first spoken in Spain,” he said. “If I didn’t speak that in my first language, it wasn’t the right first language.

This trigger for autism is probably quite rare. But it suggests that the disorder is somehow related to abnormalities in the connections between nerve cells that make use of glutamate for information transmission, and defects in those transmissions. How (or even if) these two observations—the hot spot and the neruexin flaws—fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn’t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention. And the neurexin-related discovery hints at the mechanism of what might go wrong in neurodevelopment to lead to autism. These discoveries reinforce the value of collaborative work that puts together information about patients with a relatively rare disorder, from many locales, to create a pool large enough for serious research.",

However, the study's limitations lay in the fact that most autists were interviewed in 2009, and that the sample comprises only 7-12% of the population (10% in the North American context). In other words, a sample large enough to allow proper statistical testing of the association between chromosomal events and autism may not exist. In addition, the researchers have identified a range of additional autism-related genes, including the genetic function of chromosome 21, which correlates with multiple genetic susceptibility to autism, and the gene X linked to autism.

But Kobe is one of those guys who will use his athleticism to make it a little different when it's most needed, and that has a lot of potential if taken over or out of the game.\nI like Kobe's play to be explosive. He makes it look as though he's driving the shot clock at a record 37.4 miles per hour. He's one of a kind.\nI don't think it's just for Kobe.

But when urged to also use an official email address, she refused, citing the risk that personal emails might become publicly accessible.\nTellingly, Clinton and top aides Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Cheryl Mills refused to be interviewed by the IG.\nHere’s the bottom line: Virtually everything Clinton has said about her emails has been a lie. And no longer can supporters laugh off Emailgate so easily.\nHillary’s culpability and her flouting of the law now seem clear.

Rather, President Obama is doing the dirty work. He says that Clinton used a third-party service to keep it off her server and to keep a record of what she sent to a number of others. The real question is, which one? We’ll never know for sure.

For this reason, cyclicalism often gives the impression that there is no economic order, and that nothing can change capitalism to the benefit of the labor.

Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals. Finally, it is recommended that further testing would be needed to ensure proper operation of the filter under all operating conditions.\nHercinger, Frank; Kidman, Beau; and Van Syckel, Seth, \"Transmission Intake Filtration System\" (2002).

This can be repeated for subsequent heating, cooling and operation.\n\nThe prototype had an inscribed tube on one side of the filter as a safety valve so the pump automatically shuts off the pump when it was not activated. It also had a small number on two sides of the tube indicating voltage and frequency inputs as did other electronic components, like those in a typical HVAC system. The filter also included a “plug” that fitted over the valve so a hose can be connected so as to vent when necessary.\n\nThe performance of the prototype could be evaluated by testing the pump and filter as they are being used in a system of an individual of different designs and configurations,",

Mites, fleas, and ticks are not uncommon on lawns that lack insect control. The best way to prevent infestation of insect pests is to keep your garden free of weeds. Mulch will help prevent the development of weed seeds and roots and will provide a beneficial host of pollinators and beneficial insects. Keep control of any pests that are already present in your garden, but leave some of the pest's natural host plants there so that your bees can pollinate and feed on flowers and fruits.\nIf you'd like to add some of the natural pesticides to your garden, try the following methods: garlic, lemon, basil, and chives are effective natural pest controls.

However, the fungus can be dangerous if eaten, inhaled, or spread onto surfaces by birds.\nAvoid watering your plants at night when the ground and trees are saturated. Dried up roots often harbor moisture which is too conducive for fungi and mold to grow. However if only a small amount of water falls on leaves, it does not often result in significant growth of fungi. A solution to this problem is to spray your plants, branches, and trees with water before being wet. Otherwise, your leaves, branches, or shrubs might have a large chance",

The clarity is moderate, but the logical flow is disrupted by the abrupt transition to discussing other players.

For example, a recent article about the fashion blogger for which I was speaking mentioned that the retailer, which sells in the UK, is selling online, in print and other forms of advertising. As such, the retailer is passing along the cost of the fashion blogger’s direct promotion to the consumers by offering all channels for this marketing.

Failure to have a proper gap around the conductors may also reduce their lifetime.\n\"The hazard caused by wind is a function of the wind speeds and of how many wind blows through an incident; once the wind blows you cannot stop the hazard of a flash arc, but you will have time to stop the arc before it is a fire hazard.\"\nOn that note, Alsup suggests that \"when you begin working with wind hazards in buildings ... you must remember to always take preventive measures.\n\"When assessing any design to a building, you",

Therefore, gray whales can be observed passing by California in December and January during their southern migration, and again in March, April, and May on their northern journey. As human activity has increased along gray whales’ migration route, these mammals are facing a new set of challenges.\nWhile authorities have yet to determine the cause of the gray whale’s death in Malibu, the incident near Channel Island Harbour is a stark reminder of the impact human activity can have on these giant mammals.",

        "natural_text": " There will be immense party pressure on these MPs to vote down May’s deal. But there will be significant public pressure in the other direction too, demanding that opposition MPs give May’s deal a chance, avert a cliff-edge crash, and allow the country the opportunity to move beyond Brexit.\nThe power of this dilemma will clearly depend on the content of the deal itself. For many remainers, voting for any form of Brexit will be a step too far in any circumstances. For more pragmatic remainers, though, the temptation to back a deal, depending on the softness of its content and the degree of compromise made by May, and which has also been agreed by the EU27, will be a serious option. Faced with a choice between an imperfect deal that retained significant connections to Europe, and no deal with Europe at all, many pro-Europeans may decide it is time for them to compromise too, because, like it or not, they have a dog in this fight.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": " The question is particularly important today, a day after the referendum, when May’s deal will have to be put into practice.\n\nThe UK government has set it as its aim “to see the next step towards the agreement be reached in the Autumn, so that the EU and UK economic partnership can be completed before the 2019 General election”.  But the Prime Minister has not yet made any move to do that. Even if he does, his deal is not without its problems.\n\nThe EU can offer a deal that, on the face of it, might be “good enough” for some UK voters. But it will come at a pricetag of at least 75 billion euros ($93 billion). That’s a very large sum, and it would be foolish to be so confident of success that the Prime Minister will not allow it to go past. It is not impossible, and there are certainly ways to cut the price, but the",

The deal may fall apart if Jacob Rees, David Lammy and a few MPs vote against the deal. But a deal has come close enough. In the meantime, it must be taken very, very carefully.\n\nThe public and their MPs want there to be consensus on the deal. They want 500,000 signatures on a platform that supports a deal. They value the independence of Parliament. They want Primeministers (and then Primeministers’) responsibilities to do what they know is right.\n\nThe public wants to know that there is a plan for leaving the EU, and it is not an end in itself.\n\nThe public want us to do the right thing now.

When an American purchases a Mercedes, it does not represent the U.S. Congress’ trading with the German Bundestag. It represents an American citizen’s engaging in peaceable, voluntary exchange, through intermediaries, with a German auto producer. When voluntary exchange occurs, it means that both parties are better off in their own estimation — not Trump’s estimation or General Motors’ estimation. I’d like to hear the moral case for third-party interference with such an exchange.",

There are various other countries whose interests also have direct or indirect effect upon American interest. For instance, the Mexican cartels can also be a threat to American steel and aluminum production. There is also a growing threat posed by China’s steel and aluminum industries.

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.

The text diverges into a discussion about Confederate statues and their historical significance, which does not address the prompt's focus. The writing lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow. There are no specific examples related to the prompt, and the information presented is inaccurate and misleading. Overall, the response fails to meet any of the evaluation criteria.\n\n**Summary for LLM B:**  \nLLM B's response also fails to address the prompt effectively. It introduces unrelated topics, such as a mention of a KGB agent and a vague reference to historical events, which do not connect to the murder of the three civil rights workers. The writing lacks clarity and logical flow, making it challenging to understand the intended message. There are no relevant examples or accurate information pertaining to the prompt. Like LLM A, this response does not fulfill the evaluation criteria and is deemed of low quality.\n\nGiven that both responses are equally poor in relevance, detail, clarity, coherence, originality, use of examples, and accuracy, the verdict is a tie.\n\n[[C]]"

Starting in 2010, all new federal student loans were issued by the Department of Education, which doesn’t charge collection fees to borrowers who quickly agree to make good on their defaults. As a result, students who have taken out federal loans in the last few years need not worry about an increase in fees.\nBut those who received loans from the FFELP—which discontinued new loans in 2010—have cause for concern. The Washington Post reports that nearly half of America’s outstanding debt in default comes from this bank-based federal lending program, while Tuesday’s CFA analysis finds that 16 million Americans are liable for bank-based federal student loans.\nOne of the main criticisms from the Trump administration, as stated Thursday in a “dear colleague” letter, was that the Obama memo lacked public input. Only time will tell what the public has to say about the new administration guidelines.",

A 10-page PDF document explaining the changes, including a new timeline and deadline, was sent to local education authorities Thursday.\nThe rule is a reaction to a 2005 settlement reached among the three groups that ultimately resulted in 35,000 to 42,009 debt that students in 48 states will be forced to pay back.

However, that limit is insufficient to address the problem of loan-defaults through guarantors that did not have access to funds to compensate them, according to a study by private lenders.\n“This proposal is a wake-up call,” the group continues. “Our recommendations — that guaranty lenders be prohibited from accessing funds to compensate borrowers who defaulted — will help restore order to the marketplace, and will ultimately benefit borrowers.”\nIn response to the proposed rule, “Congress passed, in 2018, a revision to the FFL Act,” the letter notes.\n“While the rule has the potential to address the ongoing difficulty of repaying student loans, and allow guaranty lenders to be held accountable, it remains problematic in a number of respects:\n",
