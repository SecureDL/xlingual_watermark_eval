The response is relevant to the prompt, discussing applications in various settings such as museums and historical cities. The depth of detail is commendable, as it mentions specific software like Vive's AR and ARKit, illustrating how these technologies can enhance learning experiences. The writing is clear and coherent, with a logical flow from one idea to the next.

The accuracy of the information appears sound, as it references known technologies and their applications.\n\n**Summary of LLM B's Response:**  \nLLM B's response is less cohesive and lacks the depth found in LLM A's answer. While it touches on the use of 3D video technology at concerts, it does not expand on this idea or provide a broader context. The clarity of writing is hindered by some awkward phrasing and a less structured flow. The response includes some specific examples, such as mentioning Google and other companies, but these are not elaborated upon effectively.

He believes those that were originally exhibited in museums in Germany were taken during the war and melted down to make weapons.\nAlongside Abbo's artworks are vintage photos of places he'd been or postcards from that time period, which Baalbaki says is to give an overall look at the life he led, in today's age of media and imagery.\nBaalbaki intends to continue his research and tracking down Abbo's works.",

The chance to meet him is now a highlight of my time in the Himalayas'.\n\nThe book is a wonderful introduction to a much-loved but unappreciated sculptor by two artists who know him well.

In any event, pre-crisis, France did not pay more than a 10 bp premium.\nNeither international capital, represented by asset managers nor the EC is going to force France to enact structural reforms. In addition, there is even less of a chance that Hollande makes a clean break and announces an aggressively pro-growth fiscal initiative.

The gap in yields is very small. At about 30 bps for a period of three years, if the euro broke down and the two countries separated, the probability that the euro would survive is about 45%.

The likelihood of the euro zone being downgraded by sovereign bond rating agencies is close to 50%. Yet none of the major rating agencies has yet put a notch or two on the down side of their euro zone sovereign bond ratings.

The Skype call also had a bad habit of disconnecting immediately after connecting with another person and had to be re-set up.\n\nAs a backup plan, we suggest using Skype.

That service, which is available online, lets you place any phone call directly from your device at cheap international rates.\n\nThere are no per-minute charges after the call is initiated. However you'll be charged an installation fee of at least $10.\n\n3 Gauge your international calling partner. Caller ID will let you know if there is a high per-minute rate.\n\n4 Learn to dial international numbers.

According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved.

        "natural_text": " gene coding for a material called neurexin, which plays a role in the development of certain cell-to-cell transmission sites (synapses), can cause autism in some cases. This trigger for autism is probably quite rare. But it suggests that the disorder is somehow related to abnormalities in the connections between nerve cells that make use of glutamate for information transmission, and defects in those transmissions. How (or even if) these two observations—the hot spot and the neruexin flaws—fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn’t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention. And the neurexin-related discovery hints at the mechanism of what might go wrong in neurodevelopment to lead to autism. These discoveries reinforce the value of collaborative work that puts together information about patients with a relatively rare disorder, from many locales, to create a pool large enough for serious research.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": " chromosomes X and Y are linked to an enhanced expression of autism, while the chromosomes 22 and 15 seem to protect against autism. (One implication of the latter finding is that autistic children who have trisomy 15 may not simply be a \"fainter version\" of individuals with autism, as has also been stated, but that the condition could be a different expression of the same thing.)\n\nThe conclusion of this study is that there may be a group of genes in several different chromosomes, in every person, that is somehow related to autism. It may be this group of genes or it may simply be the activation that happens within the complex machinery of the brain, or it may be both. The finding of so many genes is intriguing, as is the finding that each seems to influence the expression of an underlying autistic predisposition, regardless of whether the person is born with or develops autistic symptoms. In a manner of speaking, then, autism is a series of switches within certain genes",

Craig Venter, has become quite famous for a variety of reasons but mostly because of his success in creating the largest organism grown _in vitro_. After Venter's labs completed sequencing the human genome in 2000, they began searching through this database to catalog all the mutations that occur naturally and can be found in the human population. If a specific mutation was found in a child with autism it was more likely that the gene was playing a role in causing the disease.\n\nThere was one caveat to this work: the vast majority of the mutations were common, so if a",

College affordability is a more prominent issue thanks to the 2016 presidential campaign.

So the ECNs had no buyers, and even a small sell order could blow the doors off a stock price. Which it did.\nI’m very much in favor of this. Maybe someday we’ll understand all this stuff well enough to control it, but right now we don’t seem to.

For instance, Simon said that more and more research funding is coming in at the local level, not from the national government—a “systemic change,” he termed it. And while many Western companies opened their research labs in China initially because the government effectively made it a condition for selling goods in the country, said Sun, they are increasingly producing interesting work. No breakthroughs yet, he acknowledged, but they may come soon.

Such a policy would require wholesale cabling of rural and suburban connections, something that is at this time impossible for a Government seeking to achieve budget surpluses by implementing a policy that will be unaffordable if all the connections are made quickly because they'll require too much fibre.\n",

But the reality is that the Government will continue to deliver the NBN as originally planned.\"\nThe Coalition last week unveiled its own alternative NBN vision, built around HFC cable. This is a proposal which the industry dismisses as \"not realistic\", as not capable of covering a large percentage of Australia's population.\nAs well as the planned roll-out to a further 890 local areas — which is scheduled to begin in April — the company says a further 1,050 local areas are also expected to start receiving services by the end of 2015 when the roll-out is completed.\nThat means that Telstra has committed to delivering broadband services in about 1,500 (of approximately 2,000) areas by the end this year.\nBudde's comments today come in response to a question about this week's announcement that the NBN company has signed a deal with V",

Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system.

Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters.

Thus, the first four ecumenical Councils defined the meaning of the most foundational belief of the Christian faith and, as a result preserved the great promise of that faith for each one of us.

Then you just need to grab all the wasps you can (with gloves!) and place them in a bucket. (It is important to use gloves for this task).

Adult bugs feed on the phloem, the inner part of the leaves that is full of living cells. Affected leaves turn yellow and fall, creating a bare patch in the center of the plant. When a leafhopper eats enough leaves, plants suffer from leaf roll, which weakens the plant, reduces leaf growth, produces fewer set fruits and reduces fruit size.\nTo combat fungus gnats, douse with BAC at 12 ppm (200 parts per million of BAC in 400 parts water).

Statistics Canada said:\n\n\"WiT (Weights in Time) has declined by 0.5% so far this year, largely due to a 1.2% drop in the price of food and a 1.3 per cent fall in the price for shelter.\"\n\nThere's speculation that August inflation figures are being under estimated.

For more pragmatic remainers, though, the temptation to back a deal, depending on the softness of its content and the degree of compromise made by May, and which has also been agreed by the EU27, will be a serious option.

When an American purchases a Mercedes, it does not represent the U.S. Congress’ trading with the German Bundestag. It represents an American citizen’s engaging in peaceable, voluntary exchange, through intermediaries, with a German auto producer. When voluntary exchange occurs, it means that both parties are better off in their own estimation — not Trump’s estimation or General Motors’ estimation.

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.

It does not address the topic of log analysis systems, their pricing, quality, versatility, or technical support. Instead, it contains unrelated information about cookies, privacy policies, and marketing emails, which detracts from any meaningful analysis. The lack of relevance, detail, clarity, coherence, originality, specific examples, and accuracy leads to a score of 1 across all criteria.\n\n**Summary for LLM B:**  \nLLM B provides a relevant response that discusses considerations for rolling out a cloud-based systems integration platform. It emphasizes the importance of customization and flexibility, which aligns with the prompt's focus on log analysis systems. The response includes depth in discussing pricing and organizational structure, demonstrating clarity and logical flow. However, it lacks specific examples and could benefit from more detailed insights into log analysis systems specifically.
