And in a group of people who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement.\nThe PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine. Many of the deficiencies of American health care require not more technology, but the human touch.

The assistant mentions the adaptation of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" but fails to connect it effectively to the prompt's theme. The depth of detail is minimal, with vague references to the show's focus and character backgrounds. Clarity suffers due to awkward phrasing and incomplete thoughts, leading to a lack of coherence.

Specific examples are absent, and the accuracy of the information is questionable due to unclear references.\n\n**Summary of LLM B's Response:**  \nLLM B's response is somewhat more relevant to the prompt, as it touches on the implications of laws affecting religious minorities, which can be connected to the themes of oppression in \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" The depth of detail is moderate, discussing the impact on Shiite populations and the need for laws to reflect current realities. Clarity is maintained throughout, although some sentences are fragmented. The logical flow is present, as it discusses the consequences of potential laws.

All of this spectacle doesn’t make up for the fact that character motivations are at times completely dubious, and that the third act drags on far too long, but it does help.\nIt’s hard to really begrudge a film like Jupiter Ascending, both for its creative scope and in that it is one of the few-and-far-between female-led action movies, but it is equally hard to validate it beyond those elements, it’s aesthetics, and the casting of the leads.

I won't discuss plot details here (for as much as I know, the film is based on a novel by Ania Ahlborn and has been discussed in a lengthy interview with Donaldson on the official blog), but instead I am going to focus on how Jupiter Ascending differs from other epic space operas like Star Wars or Star Trek. On a surface level, there are obvious structural similarities between these three films — a young man joins a crew of misfits to save the universe, the universe is saved, and the characters return to Earth. But the film's plot and characters also reveal some interesting differences, and a few of them are more significant than others.\n\nAt first glance, Jupiter Ascending seems to be a love letter to the 1980s",

With so many incredible locations, it's important that each one be treated with the care and attention it deserves, and Pixar did a great job of that—from the spaceship's interior to the luxurious home the new king's aunt and uncle live in to the giant, majestic water-covered mountains.\n\nAs much as many have raved about the action-sequence set pieces throughout the film, the emotional beats within Jupiter Ascending have received little attention. This may be one of the film's weaker points as the story focuses on the main character's past and the many lessons she learned from her father, the ruler of Jupiter—a part of the plot that's only tangential to the film's plot. The sequence that deals with her past is the weakest of the bunch, but it still manages to be interesting as it's a nice mix of comedy, tragedy, and action to accompany her as she",

        "natural_text": " gene coding for a material called neurexin, which plays a role in the development of certain cell-to-cell transmission sites (synapses), can cause autism in some cases. This trigger for autism is probably quite rare. But it suggests that the disorder is somehow related to abnormalities in the connections between nerve cells that make use of glutamate for information transmission, and defects in those transmissions. How (or even if) these two observations—the hot spot and the neruexin flaws—fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn’t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention. And the neurexin-related discovery hints at the mechanism of what might go wrong in neurodevelopment to lead to autism. These discoveries reinforce the value of collaborative work that puts together information about patients with a relatively rare disorder, from many locales, to create a pool large enough for serious research.",

The researchers believe this association of tumor development and a genetic hot spot for autism occurs because there is a direct anatomical relationship between the site of the glioblastoma and one of several brain regions associated directly with autism. Interestingly, many people with idiopathic seizures tend to develop glioblastoma, a cancer similar to a brain tumor. The researchers speculate that the close proximity of these brain regions might explain the association of the two.\n\nBecause the hot spots in the chromosome 11 were found to occur repeatedly in people with either idiopathic or familial autism (with similar genetic abnormalities), the researchers predict that there are, in fact, similar hot spots elsewhere in the human genome.

In 1996, the General Assembly added section 4(6)6-7-302 permitting local law enforcement agencies to opt out of the public records law. (1) These agencies can establish rules, procedures, or even bar access to their records. With its opt-out provision, COs opt-out of CPRA became a \"protected\" option - something that local governments and law enforcement officials thought would allow them to regulate access to information without fear of court challenges or public scrutiny. However, the Colorado Sunshine laws - Colorado Sunshine Ordinance (\"COSO\") and Public Records Advisory Council - both limit law enforcement agencies from opting out.\n\nThe Open Records Order requires that the public records advisory",

These signs are placed in such a position that they may be seen from the driver's cab of the truck before entering the route on which they were posted. Consequently, the laboreters may expect to encounter the signs at least two times per working day.

The clarity of writing is adequate, but the response feels more like a collection of statements rather than a cohesive narrative.

If any of these contacts comes down with Ebola symptoms, then the same process starts over again.\nDavid Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, who also participated in the news briefing, agreed.\n“I firmly believe we will stop it,” Lakey said.",

They also could have prevented her from spending two hours on the waiting area of the clinic, Frieden said, because she could have spent that time outside of the clinic.\nInstead, Frieden added, she was allowed to use a waiting area bathroom and to go around the clinic, which could have led to a spread.\n\"Some of the steps that could be taken to prevent the outbreak were clearly either missed, or were never followed,\" Frieden added during the press briefings.\n\"I am as sorry as we can be about what happened here,\" Frieden concluded.\nAlthough",

It begins with a mention of the major crime squad, which is somewhat related, but quickly diverges into unrelated content about Bitcoin and a news article from the Sun. The lack of connection to the prompt about Mr. Redman and the investigation leads to a score of 1 across all criteria. The response lacks detail, clarity, coherence, and does not provide any specific examples or accurate information relevant to the prompt.\n\n**Summary for LLM B:**  \nLLM B's response, while still not directly addressing the prompt, maintains a more coherent narrative. It mentions the involvement of various police and rescue teams, which is somewhat relevant to the search for Mr. Redman. The details about a bushfire and the casualties provide some context, but they are not directly related to the prompt. The writing is clearer than LLM A's, and there is a logical flow in the recounting of events. However, the lack of direct relevance and specific examples related to Mr. Redman results in a score of 3 across all criteria. \n\nIn conclusion, LLM B performs better than LLM A due to its slightly more relevant content and clearer structure, even though both responses ultimately fail to adequately address the prompt. \n\n[[B]]: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]"

More to the point, just because you can afford to miss work or buy medication when you get sick doesn’t mean others can.\nIn the same way you don’t not vote because nothing is bothering you specifically, you don’t not get the flu shot because you are very likely to survive it yourself.

For the ESS benchmark I used a custom query that retrieves data from one of our data-warehouses and emits it to a stream that Kafka is subscribed to.

Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system.

Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals.

For the last chapter, I ended up doing an article about David Bentley Hart's The Experience of God to look and think about this chapter.\n\nPerhaps if you had put this chapter",

Over time, plastic breaks down into smaller pieces, which is plausible in an ocean with currents, waves, and degradation from the sun.\nRight now, the scientists behind the findings are figuring out where the 99 percent of mixing plastic is.

And when food chain is interrupted like that, bad things have to grow.\n\nYou can see some of the plastics and some garbage in the patch here. Do you have any idea the amount of our stuff is in that patch? One estimate is 8 million metric tons per year.

Consider taking public transit, cycling, or getting around on foot.\n\nCheck your car's battery condition at least once a year - if the battery is low, it may be a warning sign that the car's cooling system isn't working properly - this could be cause for a service appointment. If the battery has low voltage, your car may not start properly - that means it might fail to start at all on cold mornings - you want to make sure your car starts reliably.

Air-conditioning alone won't reduce your operating costs during hot humid summer months, so opening that window will give you an added benefit of removing the moisture and reducing your HVAC unit's cooling needs.\n\nOptimize other home appliances during hot summer months. Keep your washing machine at 40 to 45 degrees instead of turning it up to 70 degrees as you would during the summer (see Reference 1), because you use it less and can turn it down during hotter summer seasons, but you can't raise it as much as you would in summer months (see Reference 3).\n\nCheck your HVAC system's filters.

According to the Marine Mammal Center, gray whales have the longest migrations of any mammal.\nDuring summer, gray whales live in the Arctic in areas rich in their food, bottom-dwelling organisms. As fall arrives, however, there is less sunlight, less food, and the water turns cold, and the whales swim to Baja California, Mexico where they enter lagoons to give birth and mate. Therefore, gray whales can be observed passing by California in December and January during their southern migration, and again in March, April, and May on their northern journey. As human activity has increased along gray whales’ migration route, these mammals are facing a new set of challenges.\nWhile authorities have yet to determine the cause of the gray whale’s death in Malibu, the incident near Channel Island Harbour is a stark reminder of the impact human activity can have on these giant mammals.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": " while in the 2000's the population swelled to over 37,000, the recent decline in the Pacific's oil resources and over-commercialization of wildlife makes it more and more unlikely that whales will ever reach even half of their former numbers.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves at the end of the road.\n\nIt turns out that these magnificent, incredible creatures had been in our oceans since the time of our earliest ancestors, so perhaps it's understandable that, when faced with a choice between protecting the oil and protecting these precious creatures, we chose to protect the oil; after all, there isn't much room left for us humans.\n\nThe whaling is over, and the Pacific Ocean in full recovery, but the damage has been done. While there are still no \"whale-like\" sounds in the oceans, the effects of habitat loss and the inability to communicate with one another will make it ever more difficult for whales, and us, to survive.\n",

The IUCN has estimated the entire Atlantic population to be between 500 and 1,100 individuals, with the overall Pacific population estimated to be around 20,000 animals, with approximately 12,500 found in the North Pacific, and remaining 6,500 in the Southern Pacific. They consider the possibility that both populations will become extinct extinct by 2020, due to the effects that sea surface temperatures are having on the species, with a proposed reclassification to the Endangered Species list following. Unlike the Pacific Whale Dive, the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin normally doesn't make a beeline towards the sea cliff and it takes an angle which is closer to the direction it needs to go for a longer period of time before it chooses the cliff to make its diving maneuvers.

The text appears to be a jumbled mix of phrases that do not logically connect or provide relevant information related to the prompt. For instance, phrases like \"I was the better team\" and \"I took up my right arm position against his head\" lack context and clarity. The overall lack of coherence and clarity significantly detracts from the quality of the response.\n\n**Summary of LLM B's Response:**  \nLLM B's response, while also lacking in clarity, presents a slightly more coherent structure. It touches on expectations and the readiness of a team, which is somewhat relevant to the prompt. However, it still suffers from awkward phrasing and a lack of depth. The mention of players like Riyad Mahrez and their impact on the team adds a bit of insight, but the overall execution is still quite poor.
