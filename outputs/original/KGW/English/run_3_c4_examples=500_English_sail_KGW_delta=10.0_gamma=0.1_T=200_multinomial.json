For the former, the perception gap (the difference between actual cost and perceived cost), which is relatively high and also partially reflected in the perceived importance of high first costs, is one of the key reasons for the perceived low costs awareness on green building. The former gap was not only linked with the notion of high initial investment but also with the investment decision-making process and with the overall willingness to pay and the likelihood of doing business with green building.
