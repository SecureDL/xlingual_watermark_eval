The white fungi are part of the fungal mycelium, which, at maturity, is less active, and the green chrysantha, the active part of fungus, is less abundant then than it is at the beginning of the flowering cycle.\nThe genus name, Chaetomium, comes from the Greek, meaning \"armored\" and means that this genus has spores with rigid spore sheaths. Although very variable, chrysantha is usually dark green, somewhat smooth, and often slightly corky and ribbed. The white and fuzzy interior of the fungus is also rather large, 3-12mm long. Often, but not always, the white spores of chrysantha are visible at the surface of the fruitbody, but this may not be visible unless magnified or if the fruitbody is dried off. Although large in comparison to the fruitbody itself, the spore mass is fairly delicate. The spore mass",
