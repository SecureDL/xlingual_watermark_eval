A friend or stranger can easily put you down or cause a crisis in your confidence. Stay alone.\n\n• Talk about what is going on in your head. A friend might talk with you. If the conversation starts to go downhill, thank your friendly friend for the chat and go back to running.\n\nWhen you feel your confidence slipping, remember the good things you've done. Think",

Then continue for another two or three minutes without giving up.\n\nIf you feel that you're giving up inside your head, try saying \"I'm just breathing,\" for two minutes and focusing inward. Then continue to do this for two minutes or more (at least an hour!).\n\n3. Stay in a low gear.\n\nFor anyone with a chronic runner's knee, this could sound counterintuitive. But when your natural inclination is to push yourself, drop your pace and move in a lower gear for a short while, if possible. This will slow your pace and reduce impact on your knee.\n\nKeep the pace low, try to be more conservative in your approach to movement and don't forget that your endurance is going to improve—in spades, if nothing else. It's a win-win-win.\n\n4. Make mental and physical space for the recovery part of your day.\n",

For the first time, geneticists have begun to find common factors among families who have both autism and mental disabilities—two very different kinds of developmental delay or disorder. This \"gene-convergence\" phenomenon in autism was first revealed in 2009, in a study published in the journal _Nature_. In the new study, which I'll discuss later in the chapter, Dr. Gershon and her team have gone very far in mapping this convergence, and have uncovered many new genes related to autism and to the severity of symptoms in each individual.\n\nThere is now overwhelming evidence that autism is not simply a brain malformation and that autism is definitely not",

But with a new technology developed by David Keefe at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, researchers can look at the brains of living patients with potential autism-related abnormalities. Using Keefe's method--which focuses on changes in gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS)--a team led by Geschwind was recently able to pinpoint a particular area of the brain in a family that exhibited a range of symptoms and abilities, ranging from \"moderate\" disorders to profound autism.

Therefore, gray whales can be observed passing by California in December and January during their southern migration, and again in March, April, and May on their northern journey. As human activity has increased along gray whales’ migration route, these mammals are facing a new set of challenges.\nWhile authorities have yet to determine the cause of the gray whale’s death in Malibu, the incident near Channel Island Harbour is a stark reminder of the impact human activity can have on these giant mammals.",

They then migrate south for the rest of the year. The exact reason for the seasonal migrations is still unknown, but researchers' best idea is that gray whales are migrating to match the timing of their feeding season, which occurs once each year before traveling back north to feed again during another season. The overall aim is to migrate from Alaska south to the eastern gulf of California. While many die during their migrations, about 30,000 migrate back each year.\n\nD",

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.
