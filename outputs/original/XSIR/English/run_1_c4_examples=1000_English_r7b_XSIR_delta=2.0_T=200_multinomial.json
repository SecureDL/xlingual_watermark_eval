However, Astron argues that the British researchers didn’t have sufficient knowledge to make that claim.\nAstronomers at the Lofar site would prefer if the windmills were at least 15km away from the telescope. The current plan would see seven of the fifty turbines placed within a 15km radius of the Lofar site.\n‘It might not sound like too much of a difference, but going from a few kilometres to fifteen really makes a big difference when it comes to the strength of the reflected signals,’ said Garrett.",

A good example of what happens in a slowdown of EPS and GDP growth is the 2014-2016 stock-market environment, where we had several quarters with negative EPS growth (see chart).

However, despite the volatility, we are not in a Great Depression scenario. Here’s why:\nThe Great Depression was a result of a major credit crunch as a result of the failure of the gold standard, which essentially eliminated a major source of international trade finance. This led to a major credit contraction, deflation, and a decrease in consumer spending.\nToday, credit is readily available and consumer spending has not contracted.

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.

It is impossible to determine how much pollution is produced by a person or a society, because there are so many different sources and so many different kinds of pollution and pollution effects. A single person can emit CO2 in many different ways: by driving a car, by heating a house, by eating food, by using electricity, by producing waste, by making things, by growing food, by flying, by shipping things, by manufacturing things, by building things, by using chemicals, by using water, and so on. We don’t know how much of each of these things they do, and we certainly don’t have any way to figure out how much of it is “pollution.”\nSecond, it is impossible to calculate the “pollution inhaled” by different people. How much do they breathe in? How much of that is pollution? What kind of pollution is it? How",
