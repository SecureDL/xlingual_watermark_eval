One method is that states with higher population numbers generally get a higher percentage of the share of the Mega Millions jackpot, since there are more participants to share the winnings. Another method is that the larger the state, the larger the population of residents. Because of this, there are more potential victims of the Mega Millions, which should result in an increase in the jackpot. And finally, as the number of participants goes up, the more there are to be won.\nIn the past, it has been very difficult to understand where and when a jackpot will be.
