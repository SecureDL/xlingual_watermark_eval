The company earned an adjusted $0.24 per share for the quarter, which beat the consensus estimate by $0.04 per share. Further, thanks to its strong drilling results this year, Marathon now expects to grow its production from shale by 30% to 34%, which is up from its prior range of 28% to 32%. What makes that even more impressive is that Marathon is growing at a faster pace without increasing capital spending.\nWhile the slump in oil prices will cut into Marathon's cash flow, the company remains well positioned to handle lower oil prices. That's because it built its business to thrive on $50 oil and also has a cash-rich balance sheet to help cushion the blow. That's why last month's sell-off looks like a good buying opportunity for those who are bullish on oil over the long term.",

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.

        "natural_text": "Watch points out, a relatively small share of borrowers will be impacted by the new regulations. Starting in 2010, all new federal student loans were issued by the Department of Education, which doesn’t charge collection fees to borrowers who quickly agree to make good on their defaults. As a result, students who have taken out federal loans in the last few years need not worry about an increase in fees.\nBut those who received loans from the FFELP—which discontinued new loans in 2010—have cause for concern. The Washington Post reports that nearly half of America’s outstanding debt in default comes from this bank-based federal lending program, while Tuesday’s CFA analysis finds that 16 million Americans are liable for bank-based federal student loans.\nOne of the main criticisms from the Trump administration, as stated Thursday in a “dear colleague” letter, was that the Obama memo lacked public input.
