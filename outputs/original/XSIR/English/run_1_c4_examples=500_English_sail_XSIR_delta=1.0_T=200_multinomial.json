As they scan their food, they’ll drop debris in the ocean. And once they’re done hunting, they’ll throw all the junk in the ocean in order to keep themselves safe.\nUnfortunately, otters are not alone in this. In fact, the garbage problem is caused by millions of other species of fish, including fisher whales, sharks, and even polar bear.\nHow do we tackle it?\nFortunately, there are a variety of measures we can take, including:\n- Educate kids about the importance of not throwing any junk in the ocean.\n- Promotize more environmentally friendly fishing techniques.\n-",

The Washington Post reports that nearly half of America’s outstanding debt in default comes from this bank-based federal lending program, while Tuesday’s CFA analysis finds that 16 million Americans are liable for bank-based federal student loans.\nOne of the main criticisms from the Trump administration, as stated Thursday in a “dear colleague” letter, was that the Obama memo lacked public input. Only time will tell what the public has to say about the new administration guidelines.",

Agency officials would not comment on this specific case.\n“We know some students do not have the ability to pay back their loans and we will ask them not to opt out of the loans,” a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation spokesman told MarketWatch in an interview. “We are not allowing people to default and we are not going to do anything to make their lives better.”\nSome observers say these policies are not a true solution to the situation and suggest the real issue would be how the Treasury actually manages the money it invests. The Treasury may be running out of time.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Treasury Department\nBen Fink commented on the situation:\nIt is not a good time for taxpayers to be under undue burdens. Treasury is not only short of time but, unfortunately, not doing anything to help the masses of students who are having the difficult time paying",
        "watermarked_sample": "Watch put it, “Debate continues on whether student debt should be sold in private, but the government still has the power to force agencies to collect on loans already defaulted on.” In the new case, the agency is expected to receive $82 million, which is approximately $97 million less than the $979 million that the agency had earlier collected on the previous default case in 2018. At the same time, the US Department of Education still has five months to collect the $82 million already collected.\nOf course, the Department of Education’s position is largely irrelevant in today’s market with student loans: if the agency continues to collect on default debts, more than $80 million in the program is likely to start flowing back into the pockets of the students.\n“The biggest question in the student loan program right now is ‘What should the agency focus on?’” said Jesse Johnson, president of the AAA Foundation for Human",

He says what used to be an 18-mile trip across the river is now approximately 50. The longer hours and extra fuel are adding up. “A truck used to complete a trip in one hour and now it takes three hours,” Dufresne said.\nAll that extra time is money Dufresne says he can’t get back.

With farmers taking in fewer workers, more of the sugar will go to the processing phase. For instance, it was believed that around 1/3 of the total amount of sugar can be used for making candy.\n“The way we have the production, we don’t sell the sugar to the consumers directly but we produce it to process into sugar sweetened condensed milk, sweetened tea, and candy. With the increase in sugar sweetened condensed milks volume, the price could go up and we will do so,” he added.\nAs a result, the price of the sugar sweetened cane-based milk would be at pre-owned prices.
