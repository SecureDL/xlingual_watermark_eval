The trend, in part, may make French less attractive to children (and other younger Europeans for that matter) as a first language, according to many Frenchling teachers.\nAnd there is the “French is a foreign language to me, not an interesting one, because I cannot speak or hear it,” a common lament, especially this time of year, as the language becomes less widely available in television, literature, fashion, or in the workplace.\nBut the question of how much value should English have is not just about whether the language of business and politics will eventually take over. It is also about the preservation of the language itself.\n“Learning French is not a bad idea and I prefer it over learning",

The institutional church is largely the product of time after time of the church's rejection of a political life.\nEven with the decline in the number of church members, the number of churches continues to grow and their influence on public life continues to rise.\nThe institutions of Christianity have created an alternative political economy by providing its donors with an entire wealth of potential political opportunities.\nThe institutions of Christianity often, in this instance, fund candidates that are likely to be in the political mainstream.

For more pragmatic remainers, though, the temptation to back a deal, depending on the softness of its content and the degree of compromise made by May, and which has also been agreed by the EU27, will be a serious option.

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.
