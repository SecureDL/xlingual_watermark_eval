Petrou describes this illusion in detail in his article, entitled \"Democracy is a Fool's Game: A critical history of how our governments fail to give us what we really need\" published in the latest issue of the magazine Critical Arts. Essentially, Petrou argues, EU policies that are anti-democratic have long been pursued with a view to disguising the fact that the European project, which is itself anti-democractic and ultimately anti-European, will ultimately destroy its own host. He provides convincing historical evidence to support his thesis, citing numerous examples from the early '50s onwards that show the EU's original purpose was never to foster democracy throughout Europe.

As for the citizens, the E.P.M, the public in Germany and France see it in the same way. The public in Greece gets it.
