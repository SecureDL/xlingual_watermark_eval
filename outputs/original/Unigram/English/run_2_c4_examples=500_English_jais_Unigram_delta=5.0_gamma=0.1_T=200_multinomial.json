They are looking for performance problems at the application tier, but they don't care about the network or the operating system itself.\n\nAnother approach is to perform a live monitoring system or application monitor. The idea is to have one system or application that constantly monitors your application. The main problem here is that, if the app is not designed properly, the monitoring system itself may fail. For example, if the application design involves a high level of concurrency, you're asking the instrumentation unit to run 24x7 monitoring when, at the same time, another thread in that same instrumentation unit is calling the service under load. When the second thread is under load, the instrumentation system won't detect it. Therefore, live monitoring really needs to be tuned for the application design, not the implementation.\n",

        "unwatermarked_sample": ", a focus on teachers' performance and their professional behaviour, rather than on issues of curriculum, teaching methods and syllabus, has proved extremely effective. Many schools and even countries have gone to great lengths to monitor teachers' professional development, their behaviour, their attitudes and the effect the teaching has on pupils as well as on parents.\nThere needs to be an expansion of the role of the school in the community. To do this would involve the strengthening of networks of teachers, the strengthening of links with the local community and the provision of much more support from the local council, for example in terms of providing library services and after-school clubs.\nBut these are all strategies for a future. Today we must do what we can to protect the very small minority of schools and teachers whose work and whose dedication to children's development have already shown them to be at the very heart of a healthy education system.\n\nPatten\n.

Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system. A significant pressure change was measured but this did not affect the flow rate. Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals. Finally, it is recommended that further testing would be needed to ensure proper operation of the filter under all operating conditions.\nHercinger, Frank; Kidman, Beau; and Van Syckel, Seth, \"Transmission Intake Filtration System\" (2002).

The results of the tests performed for this system are presented in this paper along with some analysis of the data.\n\nFor the prototype, the average pressure loss due to the flow through the filter was approximately 0.8 inches of mercury. A filter's performance characteristics depend on the flow rate of the gas passing through the filter. At higher flow rates there is less of a pressure drop across the filter and less flow resistance. At lower gas flow rates the pressure drop across a filter increases which effectively increases the flow resistance.\n\nFigure 1 depicts the flow through a typical filter. The average flow of gas passing through a medium filter is approximately 60 cc per hour. The filter has a flow resistance of approximately 0.7 inches of water.\n\n",

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.
