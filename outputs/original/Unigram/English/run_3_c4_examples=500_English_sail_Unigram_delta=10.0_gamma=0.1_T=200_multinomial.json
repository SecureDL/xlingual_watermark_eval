At the time, it was reported that the city “was not sure if this project would be built” until after a comprehensive review of the public land use plan.\nMcInnis said it’s time for the city to set aside some of its $1 billion public land use plan project funding. The city has been able to raise roughly $600 million in recent years, he stated.\n“If we can’t use that money, there might not be any public land use projects going forward,” he said.\nThe money could have helped the city pay down the $10 billion in municipal debt that has kept the city afloat since the 1970s",

This was far from the case. African-Americans had a hand in abolishing slavery and made their own demands — similar to what African-Americans accomplished during the civil rights movement.
