Redemption would not be complete.\nThe Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD dealt with this threat to the meaning and implications of the Incarnation of the Word of God. The creed of the Council of Chalcedon declared that Jesus Christ is one person who exists \"in two natures\" - a divine nature and a human nature - which are neither confused (\"blended together\" into a third nature) nor divided or separated. Jesus is fully God and truly and fully human. Thus, the first four ecumenical Councils defined the meaning of the most foundational belief of the Christian faith and, as a result preserved the great promise of that faith for each one of us.
