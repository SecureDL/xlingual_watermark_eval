Here are some common speech changes associated with cleft palate repair:\nVoice changes: Cleft palate can alter the pitch and tone of a person’s voice due to the altered resonance of sound through the palate.\n\n\n|    | Voice changes                       | Other changes                                                                 |\n|:---|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0  | Pitch changes                      | Difficulty swallowing                                                       |\n| ",

More to the point, just because you can afford to miss work or buy medication when you get sick doesn’t mean others can.\nIn the same way you don’t not vote because nothing is bothering you specifically, you don’t not get the flu shot because you are very likely to survive it yourself.

This can potentially mislead investors and stakeholders about the true financial health of the business.\n\nIn addition, absorption costing may not always reflect the true cost of production, as it can lead to excess inventory buildup if production exceeds sales.

For example, gene expression research has already shown that people with Type 2 diabetes have a range of genes that are expressed differently from those of people without Type 2 diabe tes.

However, a senior Israeli political source cited three areas in which Israel's position might be softened: a settlement freeze (unannounced, but effective) at least for the marathon's duration; allowing the autonomy institutions a say on security or military matters; and granting Arab Jerusalemites the right to vote in the autonomy without incorporating any part of the city within its geographical limits.",
