For example, you don’t have to choose just one technology over the others. Cloud providers have many of the same features, so it may not be necessary to choose just one.

One can't possibly imagine a more incomprehensible being when asked to do just that. Any view which posits that God becomes a being with intellect and knowledge of all the universe is to run into this problem and that question becomes what we sometimes call the question of \"Who is God and What is the role of God?\" That question is absolutely unknowable to a man without knowledge and compassion and intellect. In a sense we can't talk of God. We can't question God.
