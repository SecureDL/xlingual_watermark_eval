Overall, patient costs dropped by 36 percent. Even taking into account the $6,000-per-patient cost of PACT, patient costs dropped 16 percent. And in a group of people who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement.\nThe PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine.

This is despite the fact that it is an objective assessment that Iran lacks the technical expertise to design and build weapons without help. The objective is to prevent Iran from moving forward with nuclear weapons development by making it unprofitable to do so. This objective is consistent with one major goal of nonproliferation policy and international law and is justified in terms of security and peace. An alternative objective is to promote proliferation by increasing international cooperation and technology sharing. While the Bush administration may be justified in the former case",

Athens has agreed to a reform on private pension plans which will require a massive reshuffle of pension funds to make them more'modern' and in line with market norms, essentially slashing pensions paid by the state and imposing new rules on workers.\nAt the same time, it has approved a public sector pay freeze and promised to raise VAT from 13.25% on everyday goods to 24%. Even allowing for the fact that at least 20% of that money will flow right back to the public sector, the government has to implement a brutal programme of austerity.\nOne of the prime reasons why Greek voters went into a frenzy over Mr. Tsipras's resignation last May was because he had promised",

I believe that there is more to this story than the mere thought of Turkey providing support to ISIS in Syria as they strive to destroy Assad. I don't believe that a country in NATO would want to cause conflict to that alliance. So, in essence would Turkey want to be the goat on this particular political sandwich? Wouldn't Turkey know that in its fight for survival Iran is their ultimate target. In an effort to be the only country in the region to survive, would Turkey make a deal with ISIS to destroy Assad while trying to hide the fact that that was the final endgame?
