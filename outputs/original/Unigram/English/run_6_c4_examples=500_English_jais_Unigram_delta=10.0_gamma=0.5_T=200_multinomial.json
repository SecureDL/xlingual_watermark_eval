The end result remains to be seen but as this scheme takes shape at least two of Maersk’s main rivals will be looked at very closely by industry analysts should it result in an upswing of tonnage for ‘Daily Maersk’.\nPhoto:- The giant Emma Maersk in port.",

The creed of the Council of Chalcedon declared that Jesus Christ is one person who exists \"in two natures\" - a divine nature and a human nature - which are neither confused (\"blended together\" into a third nature) nor divided or separated. Jesus is fully God and truly and fully human. Thus, the first four ecumenical Councils defined the meaning of the most foundational belief of the Christian faith and, as a result preserved the great promise of that faith for each one of us.
