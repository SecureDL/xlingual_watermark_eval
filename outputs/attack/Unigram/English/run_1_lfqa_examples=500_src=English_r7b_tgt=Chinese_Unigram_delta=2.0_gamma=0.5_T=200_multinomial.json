Here are a few reasons why a simple ban might not be feasible:\n\n### Legal Considerations\n\n1. **Second Amendment**: The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the right to \"keep and bear arms.\" This right is deeply ingrained in American law and culture, and any significant change in gun regulations would likely face significant legal challenges.\n\n2. **Federal vs. State Powers**: The U.S._ Constitution outlines a system of federal and state powers. While the federal government can regulate guns, many aspects of gun control are managed at the state level. Each state has its own laws regarding ownership, sale, and use of firearms, leading to a patchwork of regulations that can be difficult to standardize through a federal ban.\n\n### Social and Political Considerations\n\n3. **Cultural and Historical Roots**: Gun ownership is a significant part of American culture",

Some common examples of something unlawful but not criminal might include committing a civil wrong against a person (say, breaking your lease), or being late in paying a fine, or remaining in the country without legal status.\nWhen the government itself fails to comply with a statute or regulation, that too is more likely to be termed “unlawful” than “illegal.”",

For example, breaking a family tradition to travel rather than stay home for a holiday can be considered \"unlawfully\" living up to a tradition, but it isn't necessarily \"illegal.\"\n\n*  **Illegal:** This term specifically refers to an act that is proscribed by law.

A lot of drug dealers say they got into dealing because it was the only way they could imagine making enough money to buy nice things and provide for their families.   \n@@@In the US, the prison population is predominantly BIPOC and low-income, meaning they've experienced a lot of oppression before they entered. They may not have had access to adequate legal representation because our public defenders are criminally overworked. They're exploited for free or cheap labor (watch the 13th by Ava Duvernay), and they leave in debt and a record that will disqualify them from some jobs and housing and come up in background checks for those that are available.   \n@@@So, for a lot of incarcerated people, snitching is not going to protect people. It is going to serve the oppressors and offer up another person to be abused by the system.

This means that the punishment fits the crime, and the offender is held accountable for their actions.\n\n2. **Deterrence**: While the effectiveness of long-term deterrence is debated, the idea is that severe punishment might discourage potential offenders from engaging in criminal behavior. However, it's important to note that recent studies suggest this is not a reliable method of crime prevention.\n\n3. **Retaliation**: Some argue for a punishment that serves as a form of retribution or revenge for the harm caused by the offender.

This can be seen as a means of making offenders face the consequences of their actions to a degree that reflects the seriousness of their crimes.\n\n3. **Rehabilitation**: Many criminal justice systems have a focus on helping offenders to change their behavior to reduce the likelihood of recidivism (reoffending). This can involve making offenders aware of their criminal actions, addressing any underlying problems that might have contributed to their criminal behavior, and helping them to develop skills that can support them upon release.\n\n4. **Protection of Society**: Incarcing",

In the US a bounty hunter (or bail bondsman) is one who hunts down a fugutive who failed to appear for court after posting bond, and the bounty is generally for a portion of the amount of the bail bond. For this reason the \"dead or alive\" for wanted fugitives would have been scrapped as the trial was not yet concluded and therefore a penalty could not have been placed upon them.",

Normally they include a stop to specific trades, economic transfers or industries. A classic example would be *\"we are not selling nuclear weapon technology to North Korea, every company doing that will be punished\"*.\n- Sanctions are not unusual. While they are often the last resort of countries short before a war, they are used by economic more influential countries on countries to stop human atrocities or of specific nations gaining economic power or technology which could destabilize an entire region. \n- In many cases sanctions are not obviously successful, but in some cases it forces a country to stop aggressive actions or at least back down. Often enough however they are used as a propaganda instrument from the affected country in order to galvanize the population ... and for the population of enforcing country \n- In many cases a country (lets call it A) would not interfere with trades between Countries B and C. The problem is: the world wide economy is connected internationally and many payment systems and trades are done via US bank and payment systems. With that the US has a certain pressure power to enforce sanctions even when the trade does not directly involve their own economy.\nRegarding Russia: Russia is currently threatening (more or less directly) to invade the Ukraine, and is involved with the Crimea Occupation and the destruction of MH17. With that both the EU and the US have imposed sanctions of various levels on Russia, as especially the EU would not like to have a full blown war next to their eastern border. It most certainly did not helped that Russia attempted and performed multiple assassinations with radioactive particles and nerve gas in European countries.\nSYL",

For instance, the US has imposed sanctions on countries like North Korea over its human rights abuses and authoritarian rule, and on countries accused of suppressing political opposition or engaging in serious human rights violations, such as in Cuba, Iran, and Syria.\n\n2. **Abolishing or Preventing the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs)**: Sanctions are often employed to prevent countries from developing or acquiring nuclear, chemical, biological, or other WMDs.

Anything greater than $950 is a felony, anything below $50 can be charged as a minor infractions and anything between is a misdemeanor. \nWhere these people may be confused is that *Walgreens doesn't have to enforce these laws*.  It is not, repeat **NOT**, Walgreen's place or right to enforce laws covering larceny.  That is what the police are for, that is literally their primary function - enforce the law.  Walgreen's cannot arrest a person for shoplifting.  Now there is a bit of gray area because they do have a right to defend their property, so if they caught someone they COULD detain the person until the Police arrive but that's the point.  The Police HAVE to get involved. \nThus it becomes a business decision.  Walgreens is a multi-billion dollar company.  Someone stealing $50 of random crap from one store is such a small number that they probably accidentally lose that money in spare change under the seats of the CEO's private jet.  It would not at all be unusual for Walgreens to say \"if you see someone shoplifting note down their description and call the cops but otherwise do NOT engage with them\" because they'd rather lose the goods than have an employee hurt or even killed trying to be a hero.  \nYou know who else has this policy - Banks.  Any bank in the US you can walk in and say \"this is a robbery\" and there is a good chance they'll open up the cash drawer and let you walk out with it.  Of course a few minutes later the Police and/or FBI will come to kick your head in but that's not the Bank's problem.

Critics of the bill argue that it imposes significant compliance obligations on businesses, increases legal risks, and places a financial burden on smaller companies. They also claim that the legislation could stifle innovation and economic growth while potentially limiting businesses' ability to target their marketing efforts effectively across state lines.

This background has contributed to a more inclusive attitude, which has led to migration being seen as an important vehicle for nation-building and economic growth. Canada has always welcomed immigrants from different cultural backgrounds, thus implementing a more open immigration policy.2 ** Demographic factors**: Canada’s relatively small population and less rapid growth, thus making migration a key factor in sustaining population growth and economic dynamism. This has affected policymakers in formulating policies to attract all types of migrants to meet labour market needs and population objectives.3 ** Political and social factors**: Canada’s political environment is relatively unified and stable, with broad consensus among major political parties on migration issues, which provides a positive impetus for national development.",

Here in the UK, that age is 16. So if we have two people under 16 that have sex with each other, the law is essentially saying neither person was mature enough to make an informed decision either way on doing it. What this means is it would be very unfair to simultaneously say \"you didn't know what you were doing\" *and* \"we should punish you for doing it\".\nEdit: I should specify that the larger the age gap between the two underage participants, the less likely it is the older member will not be punished. For example, of it was two 15 year olds, then \"fair enough\", but if it was a 15 year old and an 11 year old, it would most certainly be considered an offence and dealt with accordingly.",

In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, and having sexual relations with a minor below this age can result in legal penalties for the older partner. Minors also have developmental differences, and their brains continue to mature until their mid-to-late twenties, affecting their decision-making and judgment. While not all sexual activity between minors is illegal, the age gap and the potential power imbalance between younger and older partners are often what lead to concerns about the legality and morality of these relationships.

This decision came after a series of public protests calling for such a ban, citing the need to reduce gun violence on the streets, following high-profile assassinations such as those of politician Jo Cox and Diana, Princess of Wales. The public responded with a mix of support and criticism, as many felt that the ban was an infringement on personal freedom, especially the right to own handguns for legitimate reasons such as home defense. In terms of enforcement, the ban required gun owners to surrender their handguns, and any remaining firearms to be stored in secure gun cabinets or locked safes, with regular registration and inspection required by the police.

As a result, the fingerprint ridges and patterns that the device uses to unlock the phone are no longer recognizable. \n* ***Security Design:** The primary purpose of biometric security measures like fingerprints is to prevent unauthorized access. If a device continues to recognize and unlock with a decomposed fingerprint, it would compromise the security it's designed to provide. Manufacturers implement strict security protocols, and unlocking a phone using a decomposed finger likely wouldn't go unnoticed by the system.\n* **Legal and Ethical Considerations: ** Attempting to bypass security measures even with a decomposable finger could be seen as unauthorized access and potentially illegal.

        "natural_text": "Attorney here.  Normally when the parties to a contract are in a dispute, one of them can file a lawsuit in the courts to try to get the problem sorted out. Sometimes, the parties will agree to have someone smart and experienced but who is not a judge(an arbitrator) basically conduct an informal trial just like a judge, and the parties agree that they'll treat that decision just like it was done by a judge.  Agreeingto treat the arbitrator's decision just like a judge's decision is what makes the decision *binding.* \nThe parties can make the agreement to use an arbitrator at any time. Sometimes it might be after they start disputing and they both just figure it's faster and cheaper to use arbitration. In that situation, neither has to; if you'd rather use the courts, you can decline to arbitrate.  \n*Mandatory* arbitration is when you can ONLY resolve a dispute through arbitration. The agreement to skip the courts and only use arbitration almost always comes as part of signing the main contract.  So like when you enter a cell phone contract,  that contract will usually include a provision that says both sides agree that they'll only take their disputes to arbitration through so-and-so arbitration organization. \nMany people see this kind of arbitration as favoring the company because of the company is always having so-and-so organization doing the arbitration,  that's a lot of money for the organization,  and some people think that the organization is going to return the favor and make rulings in the company's favor.  \nSo why would anyone agree to mandatory binding arbitration?  It's because they essentially have no choice. You have the choice not to buy the product or enter the contract at all, of course... but if you do decide to enter that contract,  you're pretty much stuck with the contract terms. It's take it or leave it. In contracts where each side thinks the other is important enough,  they can negotiate and tweak certain parts. But in a deal between the average schlub and Blizzard, Blizzard isn't going to waste their time trying negotiating the contract. Take it or leave it, they say.  \nIn various places, laws have been passed to say that for some types of contract,  you must have the right to change your mind about mandatory arbitration, but will put a time limit on that.  So for instance, in my last cell phone contract I had 30 days after signing the contract to tell the phone company I didn't want to do mandatory arbitration. \nGetting rid of mandatory arbitration would mean that Activision/Blizzard might not be so confident about their chances of success in arbitration, in which case maybe they'd behave better toward their customers.",

Activists do so by suing the government, judge, or whoever is enforcing the law.\nBecause abortion laws all violate the Supreme Court precedent set by Roe vs Wade they are almost always immediately struck down so they basically become unenforceable and never go into effect. Despite this Conservative States keep trying various iterations of anti-abortion laws over and over again even though there's no real point, the constitutionality of abortion laws is pretty well settled. If these laws remain on the books eventually they reach the Supreme Court who then strike it down for good.\nIn this case though SB8 is specifically tailored to get around this. In a rather scummy way at that. Because the law allows regular citizens to basically become bounty hunters to turn in people that have abortions, the government and courts don't technically enforce this law so you can't take the usual route to get this law over turned.\nSo the law will go into effect until such a time that someone actually tries to cash in the bounty on an abortion at which point it will work its way up to the Supreme Court and will likely get struck down like all the rest.\nThe catch is how many Abortions will be stopped in the meanwhile?",

The 1973 ruling established a constitutional right to privacy, which the Court used to hold that state laws prohibiting abortion were unconstitutional.\n\nThe decision is significant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Right to Privacy:** The Court recognized a fundamental right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process clause, which guarantees the right to be free from government intrusion into certain fundamental liberties. The Court held that a pregnant woman has a right to terminate her pregnancy before fetal viability (when the fetus can live outside the womb with or without artificial support).\n\n2. **State Regulations:** The ruling placed limitations on state power to regulate abortion, especially in the early stages of pregnancy. It established a framework that states could not completely ban abortion or enforce severe restrictions that created an undue burden on a woman's ability to seek an abortion.\n\n",

In short, the more intolerant an individual or group is towards others, the more they assume the right to impose their beliefs and values on others. This phenomenon can lead to a cycle of polarization and conflict where those who are most proud of their own views are least likely to accept or tolerate different ones.

        "natural_text": "It’s not just for LEOs. It’s for any government official performing their governmental duties. It comes in to play with law enforcement a lot, though, as damages do occur in pursuit of criminals and such; for example the case in Denver a few years back. Cops chased an armed shoplifting suspect and he holed himself up in a random house who’s owners were not home. Police destroyed the hell out of this person’s home in pursuit of a shoplifting suspect and were ruled to be not liable for the damages due to them occurring during a pursuit of a dangerous individual. When stuff gets destroyed by cops in their line of duty, the owners are usually still gonna be pretty mad about it. Being told to kick rocks and that the city/department responsible for the damage won’t be reimbursing you can be quite infuriating",
        "unwatermarked_sample": "Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine in the United States that protects government officials, including police officers, from being held personally liable for actions taken within their official capacity, as long as those actions do not violate \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" This immunity has been a topic of debate and controversy for several reasons:\n\n1. **Protection from Liability**: It is intended to shield public officials from undue litigation and financial burdens, allowing them to carry out their duties without fear of personal consequences for every decision or action. This is particularly relevant in law enforcement, where decisions made during high-pressure situations can have significant and sometimes deadly outcomes.\n\n2. **Obstacles to Accountability**: Critics argue that qualified immunity undermines public accountability and often protects police officers even when they act maliciously or in violation of the law. This has led to numerous high-profile cases where police officers have been found to have used excessive force, made false arrests, or engaged in other",
        "watermarked_sample": "Qualified immunity for police officer is a legal doctrine that provides police officers with immunity from being sued for actions taken within their official duties, as long as those actions are deemed within their “discretionary authority.” This means that if a police officer acts in good faith and within their job responsibilities, they cannot be sued, even if their actions result in harm to individuals or property.\n\nThe controversy surrounding qualified immunity arises from several factors:\n\n1. Lack of Accountability: Critics argue that qualified immunity can lead to a lack of accountability for police officers, particularly when their actions result from misconduct, negligence, or abuse of power. This can discourage individuals from filing lawsuits due to the high legal bar set by qualified immunity.\n\n2. Inconsistent Application: The interpretation of what actions are within “discretion” versus “disregard of plain Constitutional violations” can vary widely among judges and legal systems, leading to inconsistent treatment of cases.\n\n3.

        "natural_text": "There are a lot of issues that contribute to this, some if it's policy related, some of it isn't.\nFirst, DAs are an elected position and the seat can be bought for practically nothing. Many DA seats have been taken over by activists who will drop criminal charges depending on who it is. Because of this, people feel like they have a chance to get away with it.\nThen there's the issue in some cities in California having a rule where any petty theft under $995 will not be pursued. This has lead to people shoplifting on mass because they know they can get away with it.\nTo add, being stuck in your house without a job can really tax on people. This is why a lot of people were going out and marching because despite covid, the marches themselves were not really policed in spite of people being really close to one another. This promoted people to be activists even when they didn't believe or really understand what was going on. Now that the activism has slowed down due to the election being over, people are still used to wondering the streets and given that they've been told they live in a racist system and that capitalism is evil, it's not a surprise that many people would vandalize places in these cities.\nAlthough the weather isn't as much of a factor, it is getting nicer out so people are going out more. A lot of crime is spontaneous, you see a house, no one is watching, you wrap your head in a shirt and break in to steal some shit.\nNot to mention that covid killed a lot of jobs and now that people have been not working for several months, people have decided that they don't want to work, which has caused a labor shortage. This leads to people being overworked because the jobs they do still demand work from them only now there's less help, and that causes stress, frustration, and that might be channeled from the previous point on being an activist. It can also just result in fights breaking out, people are on edge and there's a lot of division in the country right now.\nAnd no, it's not just the summer, places like NYC have a jump in crime %22 compared to this time last year. Although there are environmental factors like covid and the fact that it's not winter, it's mainly just bad policy.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": "There are several complex reasons why crime rates may be higher in cities governed by democratic principles, despite the democratic governance system intended to foster fairness, equality, and public welfare. Here are a few factors that could contribute to this phenomenon:\n\n- **Social and Economic Inequality:** Democratic governance, while advocating for equal representation, can sometimes lead to disparities in socio-economic conditions within cities. Areas with higher poverty rates, lack of access to quality education, and limited job opportunities often experience higher crime rates. socioeconomic inequality can create environments conducive to criminal activities as individuals may turn to illegal means to survive or achieve financial gain.\n\n- Law Enforcement Practices: The effectiveness of law enforcement strategies can vary across different democratic administrations. Some criticism might arise if the police department focuses more on reactive and punitive measures instead of proactive community engagement and prevention. Inadequate resources, poor training, or biased policies might also impact community trust and overall safety.\n\n**Community Engagement and Social Fabric:** Democratic ideals often emphasize",

He goes to his stockbroker, buys puts ( contracts that guarantee the sale of a stock at a certain price ) then changes Alices web page.  Bob has graduated from reading data to writing data.  This is known as a MODIFICATION ATTACK.\nWhen the world reads that Alice's web page that now openly supports Stormfront, her stock tanks, and Bob buys the stock at a low price, invokes the contract with his broker, and sells at a high price.  This is riskier than a simple access attack because there are now clear traces showing how Bob profited.  There is also the downside that Alice will be very aware that she has been attacked, and this will lead her to harden her defenses, and to call the cops.\nSo Bob may add a new wrinkle.  He not only modifies information in Alice's database, but he then defrauds Alice directly, using her corrupted data against her.   **It is this direct, post-modification contact that make Bob's actions a REPUDIATION ATTACK**.\nBob, in preparation for the attack, took out a loan with Alice's bank.  When he does his modification attack, he changes Alice's records to show that he paid off the loan.  When Alice's bank requests the regular monthly payment from Bob, Bob calls up Alice's customer service, and informs them that they made a mistake.  They check their records, and decide that the loan is indeed paid off.\nSo Bob walks away with free money.    The upside of the repudiation attack is that if Bob has done it skillfully, Alice may never know.  Bob may be able to do it multiple times.\nThe downside - from Bob's point of view - of a repudiation attack is that he has to give up some contact information to Alice.  If Alice's security people are on their toes, they might be able to trap Bob.\nSuppose that Charlie, Alice's data security officer, is indeed on his toes.  Prior to Bob's attack, Charlie wrote a maintenance program that runs in the background, checking all alleged payments.   Any time a payment is recorded as having been made, Charlie's program attempts to match the payment with ACH records from whichever bank was the other party in the transfer.\nAny time that the maintenance program detects a problem, it sends a text message to Charlie.  When Bob commits his modification attack, Charlie knows about it within minutes.\nCharlie contacts Dave, the agent who works in the financial crimes division of the local FBI office.  Charlie has Bob's telephone number from the call to customer service, and Bob's social security number and home address from the loan application.  Dave then gets a warrant to search Bob's premises.\nDave then goes...well, we are getting a bit off topic now.  We will leave Dave and Bob to their cat and mouse games.  The important point here is that a repudiation attack involves post-attack involvement with the victim, and therefore can be very risky.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": "A repudiation attack is a type of denial of service (DoS) attack on a distributed hash table (DHT) where a node falsely claims to be a specific peer in the network. The goal of such an attack is to disrupt the normal functioning of the DHT by causing the victim to consume resources, experience increased traffic, or lose credibility. \n\nHere’s a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **False Claims of Presence**: In a DHT, routing and lookup functionality depend heavily on the node’s claimed identity. In a repudiation attack, a malicious node falsely claims the identity of another node, known as the \"victim\".\n\n2. **Impact**: A node that is frequently wrongly identified as a victim can be subjected to repeated routing queries, messages, or messages that the victim would typically receive. This can lead to resource depletion, service degradation, and even the victim being labeled as unreliable, causing them to be shut out of the network for legitimate activity.\n\n",

This tactic can lead to fraud if used with malicious intent to gain an unfair advantage from the contract. <<END OF RESPONSE>> <<START OF RESPONSE 2>>\n\nIn the context of contract law or online transactions, a repudiation attack can also refer to any negative or threatening action taken by a party that directly undermines the validity of a contract or a negotiated deal, particularly those involving electronic transactions like cryptocurrency or online contracts.\n\nFor example, if a seller initiates a return of a purchased good before receiving full payment, this can be seen as a repudiation attempt if it's clear that the seller does not have an intent to continue fulfilling the contract on the agreed terms. In cryptocurrency trading, a repudiative breach can involve a trader rejecting trades that had already been agreed upon before a market order",

        "unwatermarked_sample": "The reason nunchucks (also known as nunchaku) are illegal in many places, while guns are not, can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Purpose and Intent**: Nunchucks are designed for combat and self-defense, and their use typically implies hostile intentions.

Guns, especially those designed for rapid fire and large-scale destruction, are typically heavily regulated to ensure they are not misused. Nunchucks, while capable of causing significant harm, are generally seen as less lethal and less controllable in the hands of an individual compared to guns.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The prohibition of nunchucks can also be linked to historical events and cultural associations.

This diversity can mitigate potential biases that might arise from a courtroom exclusively filled with legal professionals or experts.\n\n2. **Mitigated Professional Bias**: Professional biases that might influence a judge or a legal expert can be mitigated to some extent by a jury's perspective.

This authority generally includes the right to control what happens on the property. If someone acts negligently, recklessly, or with malicious intent and causes harm or damage to others, the landowner might be held vicariously liable to some extent.\n\n2. **Foreseeability of Harm**: In many legal systems, there is a duty to prevent foreseeable harm. If an owner knows or should have known about a dangerous condition or activity on their property and fails to address it, they may be held responsible for any injuries or damages that result from the activity.\n\n3. **Negligence**: If a landowner fails to take reasonable care to prevent harm to others, they may still be found liable.

Imagine that Owner owns a plot of land and just ignores it, but Squatter comes in and builds a house there and Owner doesn't do anything about it.  Squatter has actually provided value to the community and is viewed by the law as deserving the land more than Owner does.

Open and Notorious (Visible Ownership): The squatter must occupy the property in a manner that is obvious to the owner, such as living in the property, using it for activities, or making improvements that are visible to the public. This is to avoid secretly occupying the land.\n\n2. Continuous Possession: The possession must be continuous, uninterrupted, and for a specified statutory period. This duration varies by jurisdiction but is often several years, such as 5, 10, or 15 years. The longer the period, the more difficult it is to challenge the claim.\n\n3.

Crime and Vengeance: Some individuals may kill to avoid punishment for their own crimes, such as a murder, theft, or fraud, and commit murder to avoid legal consequences. Others may act out of a desire for vengeance, motivated by a personal, emotional, or financial grievance. \n\n2. Mental Health Issues: While insanity is a specific diagnosis, other mental health conditions can also play a role in homicide. These can include severe depression, severe anxiety, or bipolar disorder, where an individual may act impulsively or suffer from impaired judgment. \n\n3. Substance Abuse: Drug or alcohol addiction or intoxication can lead to violent behavior, including homicide. Impairment in judgment, loss of control, and aggression are common outcomes of substance abuse. \n\n4.

Substance Abuse: Drug and alcohol abuse can alter brain chemistry and influence decision-making, leading to increased aggression and violence.\n\n3. Environmental Factors: The environment can play a crucial role in predisposing individuals to violence. This includes growing up in areas with high crime rates, exposure to violence at home, or experiencing significant trauma.\n\n4. Economic and Social Factors: Poverty, unemployment, social isolation, and a lack of opportunities can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and desperation, potentially triggering aggressive behavior.\n\n5.

Ideological Conflicts:** Disparities in ideology (political, religious, social, etc.) can lead to tensions that escalate into conflicts if resolutions are not found.\n\n* **Economic Factors:** Economic competition can spark competition that ends in war. This can include competition for oil, water, market access, or economic resources.\n\n.**3.

        "natural_text": "The US Supreme Court decided that since people make mistakes, particularly cops, there should be a whoopsie card that can be played sometimes in civil court to protect the cop (or other public entity). Qualified Immunity can apply to any person acting under “color of law” to include school teachers, administrators, firefighters, and elected officials( and way more). Obviously it’s not a real card, but a theory and legal defense. You get the idea. The card can only be played in civil court, not criminal court. It can be requested to be played (by the cop or other person getting sued) and a judge (or judges) has to agree that it can be played. \nThe card can only played if someone’s civil rights were actually violated and those rights were not “clearly established” by law or legal precedent (precedent meaning it has been addressed in court before and a court made a legal decision on it already).\nThe card, when allowed to be played in court, says that, yes, a cop or some other public entity screwed up and made a mistake and violated someone’s civil rights. That  person that violated the rights won’t be held liable in a federal civil court (immune from lawsuit) because the screw up was something that was not clearly established already. In essence, that person made a reasonable mistake. \nWhen the Supreme Court came up with the idea of Qualified Immunity, it said that the idea was to protect people doing their jobs in good faith from being sued frivolously all the time. Meaning, a cop or some other public figure can do their jobs without being afraid of getting sued for anything and everything. Otherwise those public figures would not be able to do their job because they would get sued in civil court all the time for stupid stuff. The Supreme Court said that QI is not intended to be a blanket of protection for everything and does not cover cops (or others) who knowingly violate someone’s rights or reasonably should have known that those rights were clearly established. \nA lot of times this gets brought up in use of force cases where the question is whether a cop used excessive force. A lot of people get confused about QI and say the courts require that the exact situation has happened before and been addressed in court. Not really the case. The right to be free from excessive force (what the courts have said is considered a seizure under the 4th Amendment) has already been clearly established. \nQI is also often confused for indemnity. Indemnity or indemnification is separate and protects cops or other “color of law actors” from being held personally liable. That means if you sue a cop for something and are awarded money, that money is not paid by the cop directly. It’s usually paid by an insurance company that the police department pays for a policy to cover them. Like doctors who have to have malpractice insurance. If you sue a doctor, that money comes from their insurance company. \nThat’s a super broad explanation, there is a lot more to it but hope that helps.",

Qualified immunity shields officials from liability unless their conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\" that are \"objectively reasonable\" under the circumstances.\n\nHere’s how it works and why it has been a topic of debate:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The primary purpose of qualified immunity is to protect public officials, such as law enforcement officers and government employees, from the burden of defending themselves against lawsuits when performing their official duties. It is designed to allow them to make decisions without the fear of being sued for every mistake or in a situation where the applicable law is unclear or evolving.\n\n2. **Application**: For a law enforcement",

Doe,* 541 U.S.*,* which stated that government officials performing discretionary functions are generally shielded from lawsuits unless their actions are deemed to have been arbitrary or punitive or to have manifested a willful disregard of a plain legal duty that has caused harm to a person's rights.

        "natural_text": "Its very rare that a prosecutor is able to appeal something in the US.  The following issues tend to be more academic than anything else.  Yes, they do occasionally happen, but the vast majority of prosecutors will go their entire careers without ever having filed an appeal.  In the exceedingly rare occasion when a prosecutor does file an appeal, its typically a once in a lifetime kind of deal.\n1) As far as sentencing goes, they can only appeal a sentence in which there is some obvious legal error.  This would be a case in which a sentence deviates from some sort of mandatory sentence - IE, the sentence is below a mandatory minimum sentence or falls outside of mandatory sentencing guidelines.  Prosecutors cannot appeal a sentence simply because they don't like it.\n2) Prosecutors cannot appeal a jury verdict.\n3) Prosecutors cannot appeal a judge's dismissal unless that dismissal was due to a misapplication of the relevant law.  This would be something like the judge ruling that the law in question was unconstitutional or ruling that the indictment against the defendant didn't state a cause of action when it did.  \n4) Prosecutors can appeal certain pre-trial procedural issues, such as the admissibility of evidence.  This has to happen before the trial actually starts.  Once the trial starts the prosecution has effectively waived any right it may have had to appeal pre-trial rulings.  \nAgain, a prosecution appeal of a pre-trial ruling is *much* rarer than it sounds.  Defendants don't have any obligation to the court and typically appeal any appealable issue, even if they don't have a good faith basis for the appeal.  Prosecutors *do* have obligations to the court and cannot appeal a pre-trial ruling unless they have a strong, good faith basis for believing that the ruling was in error and that the ruling *will* have effect the outcome of the trial.  \nIn other words, for a prosecutor to challenge a pre-trial ruling the judge had to get it really, incredibly wrong *and* it had to be concerning a major issue in the case, such as if a key witness would be allowed to testify.",

Here are some of the common circumstances under which a prosecutor can appeal:\n\n1. **Conviction or Sentence:** If a defendant is found guilty of a charge or receives a sentence that the prosecution believes is undeserved, the prosecutor can appeal the verdict or the sentence. This is typically based on the grounds of legal error or if new evidence comes to light that could have affected the outcome.\n\n2. **Legal Errors:** Prosecutors can appeal if they believe the trial court made a significant legal error, such as misapplying the law, failing to instruct the jury correctly, or violating the defendant's constitutional rights.

It forbade landlords in areas with high transmission rates from evicting tenants due to nonpayment of rent, which was an issue because so many Americans had lost their jobs and were struggling to make ends meet (all rent payments would be due at the end of the pandemic or when the moratorium expired). While this was great news for renters in those places who were struggling financially, it was bad for the landlords who relied on that income to support themselves. \nThe Supreme Court recently ruled that the CDC had overstepped its authority by issuing the order and have overturned it. Some states and cities have their own eviction moratoriums in place and those still stand, but the federal protections have been killed.

[[ Additional Context: The eviction moratorium has been a topic of significant news coverage globally due to its potential to affect millions of individuals and families. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a nationwide eviction moratorium on September 4, 2020, to limit housing instability and its impact on public health during the pandemic. However, this moratorium has faced legal challenges and has faced ongoing debates about its necessity and impact on property owners' rights.

Here’s a breakdown of how being a slum landlord might work:\n\n### 1. **Ownership and Management:**\n- **Ownership:** Slumlords typically own properties in low-income neighborhoods or areas that are perceived to be risky investments.

If it was a case of mistaken identity and now it seems you murdered somebody else, well that's another case and you'll have to be charged with that crime and have another trial.\nIn Kyle Rittenhouse's case, Kyle claims he shot someone in self defense.

When a defendant pleads guilty, they are essentially admitting to the charges, which often means the prosecution no longer needs to present evidence, and a conviction can be secured immediately. Conversely, pleading innocent shifts the burden back on the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n2. **Legal Consequences**: Pleading guilty can lead to immediate sentencing, as the defendant acknowledges their responsibility for the crime.

Sometimes Congress gives the acts that it passes names that are directly related to what the act does.  Sometimes they don't.  The Animal Welfare Act was not designed to regulate animal welfare.  \nThe Animal Welfare Act came about because the 1960's pet industry would sell off excess pets, mostly cats and dogs, to research facilities.  So if your local 1960's pet shop was selling kittens, once those kittens got too old to sell they would be shipped off to a medical lab.  The Animal Welfare Act was designed to stop that.\nAll the act does is to prohibit that practice and to establish a regulatory framework under which medical labs can be inspected to ensure that they're not using old pet animals for experimentation.  It only covers animals that were widely being sold as pets in the 1960's - most animals are not covered by it.\nIts not unusual for things like that to be regulated at the state level in the US.

The AW Act provides an exception for animals used in research, allowing for the use of these species in animal testing unless an alternative method is available. This exemption allows researchers to conduct experiments on mice and rats to advance scientific knowledge, develop new treatments, and make medical breakthroughs.\n\n- **\"Unintended\" vs. \"Induced\" Suffering:** The Act excludes species that cause \"unintended suffering\" or where suffering is \"inducers\" for other purposes.

Both teams and players are expected to adhere to the rules, and officials are generally quick to identify and penalize any rule violations. This focus on fairness and respect for the rules often leads to more frequent ejections.\n\n2. **Referee Interaction:** In baseball, umpires, or referees, have a more prominent role in the game.

This means that pitchers, batters, and fielders can express themselves with verbal and symbolic interaction, making ejections more feasible. In contrast, physical contact sports like football have a higher risk of injuries and can become more physically aggressive, making ejection a last resort to avoid unnecessary strife.\n\n2. **Referee's Role**: Umpires in baseball are particularly active and visible on the field, often making close calls and maintaining a visible authority to ensure fair play.

It created such a problem at the local jail, that they moved one to a different facility in a neighboring parish (county).  At the next court date, they both appear before the judge and we notice that one of them got a prison tat’ of a cross right between his eyes.

She kept using the “innocent“ sister‘s name and identification during arrests. The twin sister is probably still filing expungements and fighting with bureaucracy to keep her own name clear. But, after a time, because the criminal sister still operates in the same general locale, local law-enforcement became aware of the situation, and would realize the twin was telling the truth.

This is particularly true for crimes that involve malice or recklessness. However, in most criminal legal systems, consequences and punishments are generally determined based on the outcomes of a person's actions, rather than just the intent behind them. There are several reasons for this:\n\n1. **Deterrence and Prevention**: Punishing based on outcome is often seen as a way to deter individuals from committing harmful acts by making them understand the potential consequences of their actions. This approach is based on the idea that individuals are less likely to engage in harmful behavior if they know it could result in severe punishments.\n\n2. **",

Rewards for meeting specific goals, sales targets, or project milestones can motivate individuals to work toward achieving those objectives.\n\n-  **Efficiency and Prioritization:** Prioritizing results helps identify areas where people are successful and areas that need improvement.

Whether this is legal or not is still being chewed over, but at least at a practical level it’s very easy to get around biometric security if the person is physically present.\nAnother issue with biometrics - if somehow the biometric data is compromised and able to be replicated there’s no way for the user to change their biometric. I see u/cherryreddit mentioned Angela Merkel’s fingerprint - from now on she can’t use that biometric on anything, the information is compromised and able to be replicated.

For example, a common method used in social engineering is to obtain a photo of a person's fingerprint. This can then be used to mimic the user's biometric authentication, especially if the same type of reader is used. Physical biometric security systems might not be as secure as passcode-based systems when such vulnerabilities exist.\n\n2. **Hardware Security**: Modern smartphones often use advanced hardware to store biometric data securely.

Biometrics, being unique to each individual, cannot be easily replicated or shared, making it harder to transfer or guess.\n\n2. **Implementation Complexity**: Creating a secure biometric system can be complex.

The plea removes the need for an extensive trial, where the prosecution might need to gather and present evidence to prove each element of the charge. This efficiency can be a factor in the judge's decision when determining the sentence.\n\nAdditionally, some sentencing guidelines in various legal systems are structured to provide incentives for guilty pleas.

During this time, the convicted individual has the right to file appeals, challenge evidence, seek writs of habeas corpus, and argue about procedural issues. This process can be lengthy and is often funded by legal aid services or public defenders.\n\n2. **Rehabilitation and Deterrent Effect**: Many jurisdictions have laws mandating a period of incarceration as a way to potentially rehabilitate and reduce the likelihood of future criminal behavior.

        "prompt": "Q: Who is Kyle Rittenhouse and why is his trial a big thing?\nA:",
        "natural_text": "Answer:\nKeep in mind this is coming from someone without any formal legal background. This is a write up with facts from the trial. \nRittenhouse is a 17-year-old dude from Illinois. I forget what city, but it is quite close to the IL-WI border. He's worked in Kenosha, he has family and friends who live in Kenosha. I believe he said he gave money to an older friend of his (Dominic Black) to buy an AR rifle. This firearm never left the state of Wisconsin and was only ever possessed by Rittenhouse when Black was also present. On the 25th, Rittenhouse was given the rifle by Black.\nRittenhouse was not an EMT, however was an EMT cadet with his local fire department and had some basic EMT and medical training. He and several friends went to Kenosha essentially to look after the community after seeing the destruction the night before due to riots occurring because of the Jacob Blake shooting. An owner of a used car lot called Car Source asked for protection (from people he knew and ultimately became Rittenhouse and his friends) of his business after seeing every car burned at another location. They agreed and mostly remained around this location.\nDuring the day, Rittenhouse got a sling for his rifle so it was attached to his body. This made it so he would not have to set the rifle down or be able to be stolen while he gave someone medical attention or handled a fire extinguisher. Later, a police line essentially moved them from the Car Source. During the night, Rittenhouse and his accomplices put out dumpster fires and gave medical attention to some people with minor injuries.\nA man, Rosenbaum, was seen being very aggressive towards Rittenhouse and his accomplices. Rosenbaum even made threats at Rittenhouse twice. One time where he said something close to \"if I catch you alone I'll kill you.\" He also yelled (as a white man) \"shoot me n•••a! shoot me n•••a!\" At other similarly armed men. Rosenbaum also becomes angry and aggressive when a dumpster fire is put out. Later, Rittenhouse believes he is walking with a friend, but loses him, making him alone.\nThe first shots: Rittenhouse, alone, finds himself being chased by Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum yells \"fuck you!\" at him and throws what I believe is an empty plastic bag in his direction. A man nearby shoots 2 rounds into the air. Rittenhouse reacts, unsure where they came from, he turns towards Rosenbaum, who is charging Rittenhouse, and Rittenhouse points his rifle at Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum does not stop. Rittenhouse runs again, to find himself somewhat cornered because of some parked cars and other protestors. Rittenhouse stops when cornered and turns around, once turned around, Rosenbaum lunges at Rittenhouse, grabbing for his rifle. Rittenhouse fires 4 rounds very quickly one after another. These rounds killed Rosenbaum. You may hear that Rosenbaum was shot in the back. Although true, this is misleading. This round goes into his back entering his body closer to his head and the bullet goes down his body as if he was shot from above. This shot goes into his back this way because Rosenbaum is horizontal as he lunges at Rittenhouse and his body is lower than the rifle when this bullet is shot. I hope that makes sense. Rittenhouse stays for a brief second, and calls his friend, Black, for a few seconds to tell him he shot someone because he had to. His call was cut short when a mob begin to chase him while threatening him and throwing things at him. Of course, Rittenhouse runs away. Rittenhouse begins running towards the police line to turn himself in.\nAfter running down the street followed by a mob of angry, aggressive, and threatening demonstrators, Rittenhouse trips and falls due to being lightheaded from a combination of running and being struck in the head by a concrete rock. When having fallen down, an unknown man kicks Rittenhouse in the face. Rittenhouse fires 2 shots at him as he is being kicked, both miss, this man runs away.\nVery shortly after, Rittenhouse is struck in the back of the neck/upper back with a skateboard by a man named Huber. Huber sort of runs over Rittenhouse's prone body after this, while also grabbing for Rittenhouse's rifle. Rittenhouse fires a round into his chest as Huber is on top of him, proving fatal for Huber.\nSimultaneously, another man, Grosskreutz is running after Rittenhouse as well. Grosskreutz also has an illegally possessed handgun in his hand. Grosskreutz stops advancing towards Rittenhouse (once he is around 3-4 feet away) because of Rittenhouse's shot at Huber. This causes Grosskreutz to stop and put his hands up, still keeping his handgun in his hand. Rittenhouse sees him quickly after shooting Huber and points his rifle at Grosskreutz, which is also why Grosskreutz put his hands up. However, I believe (based on video) that since Grosskreutz stops and puts his hands up, Rittenhouse begins to slightly lower his rifle. Grosskreutz testified that Rittenhosue \"reracked\" (also known as rechambering) the rifle at this time. Rittenhouse disputed this in court and I believe video evidence shows that this never happened. Once Rittenhouse sort of slightly lowers his rifle, Grosskreutz (to his own admission and testimony) lunges at Rittenhouse and points his handgun at Rittenhouse's head. Rittenhouse is quick enough to shoot Grosskreutz before Grosskreutz is able to advance any further. He hits Grosskreutz's bicep, damaging his arm severely. Grosskreutz runs away seeking medical attention and lives to tell the story. For this shooting, I want to emphasize (because this is pretty key) that Grosskreutz admitted in his testimony that Rittenhouse did not shoot him until he lunged at Rittenhouse, dropped his arms, and pointed his handgun at Rittenhouse.\nRittenhouse gets up and advances towards the police, putting his hands up when he approaches trying to turn himself in. The officer (who is in his squad car) who is being approached by Rittenhouse, orders Rittenhouse to stay back, pepper sprays Rittenhouse, and tells Rittenhouse to go home. Rittenhouse goes home in Illinois where he explained to his mother what happened. Rittenhouse goes to his local police station to turn himself in, driven by his mother. He arrives at the police station less than an hour after the shooting.\nThe big thing part comes in protecting self defense as this case could cause precedent.",

If someone can demonstrate that they possess something, there is a presumption that they have gained ownership or at least a valid claim to it, which the other party must then challenge.\n\nThis principle is often used in legal contexts where the issue of possession is central to the case, helping to establish a legal foundation upon which to build a broader legal argument.

Legal Strategy: A legal team might recommend a \"not guilty\" plea during the initial stages of the legal process for several reasons:\n   - Plea Bargaining: The prosecution may offer a reduced charge or a more lenient sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. By pleading not guilty initially, you maintain the option to negotiate and potentially avoid harsher penalties.\n   - Gather Evidence: Pleading not guilty allows you to gather and present evidence that supports your version of events.

        "watermarked_sample": ": In the presence of clear video evidence or a blood draw indicating intoxication, a defendant can still plead not guilty. The most common reason to plead not guilty is based on a factual defense: they sincerely believe that they were not committing any illegal act, either because they were not aware of breaking any laws or were falsely accused. In legal proceedings, however, a defendant's knowledge of illegality is tested based on an objective standard, meaning what a reasonable person under similar circumstances would know about the law and their actions. For example, if you were operating a vehicle while intoxicated, a blood draw showing alcohol levels above the legal limit can be powerful evidence of your guilt, but a defendant might still plead not liable on the grounds of ignorance of the actual state of intoxication or a genuine mistake of fact. It's wise to carefully evaluate the evidence and consult with a legal professional to determine the most appropriate course of action as each case can vary based on its unique circumstances and legal requirements.\n\nA: Some",

This has led to concerns that private prisons might increase the cost of incarceration without necessarily improving the quality of correctional services. Critics argue that these higher costs can contribute to the mass incarceration of people who could otherwise qualify for lesser penalties if housed in federal or state facilities at a lower cost.\n\n2. **Incarceration of Vulnerable Individuals**: Private prisons have sometimes been criticized for receiving contracts to lock up groups of inmates that traditional corrections departments may avoid due to budget constraints or difficulty maintaining staff per federal standards.

In such cases, canceling the debt could be seen as a moral and just act.\n\nSecondly, the decision to borrow for education is often made under significant pressure and limited information. Many students may not fully comprehend the long-term financial implications of their loans or the potential for economic shifts that could affect their ability to repay. This lack of full awareness and the pressure to attend college for better career prospects can be considered as mitigating factors when deciding on debt relief.\n\nFurthermore, the repayment of student loans can have a profound impact on an individual's financial well-being",

        "natural_text": "The guillotine is actually a quite modern and humane method of execution. It is quick and reliable. There were some reports from the executions during the French revolution indicating that the persons may have been alive after the executions but these have been debunked, although the myth is still propagated. The guillotine were in use up until 1977 when executions were abolished as a form of punishment in the countries using it. But it is still a method considered for executions even today.\nThe issue with the guillotine is that it is quite bloody which can be quite grusome for the people watching as well as those who have to clean up afterwards. But for the executed it is one of the best way to do it. Other countries used the long drop hanging method which is also instant but does not pierce the skin and therefore is less grusome. The problem with the long drop is that it requires more experience by the executioner as if the length of rope or the weight is wrong then it can result in strangling or decapitation. And today only a handful of people in the world have performed the long drop and none of them can be considered to be experienced.\nLethal injection is maybe the best way to perform executions although the process does take a lot longer then other method which can be considered as cruel in itself. Gas chambers is not as reliable and also does take a long time as well as dangerous for the executioners, it is very unpractical way of execution except for mass executions. Firing squads are a very practical easy way of execution by militaries as the tools are readily available. However it is quite unreliable and it is not uncommon for the executed to live for minutes after being shot, maybe only dying from a mercy shot to the head afterwards.",

The method was thought to bring the most extreme suffering for the longest period, which is not what one expects from a state-administered punishment. In France, the use of the guillotine was mandatory for certain crimes, and those who opposed the use of this method pointed out that it inflicted an unnecessarily prolonged agony on the condemned. In Britain, the execution methods of the gallows and hanging are generally less brutal, with the immediate impact being a clean cut, a swift and precise impact that results in a swift cessation of breathing.

However, despite being considered a humane method, the sight of bloodshed from a successful execution might still be unsettling for some.\n\nIn contrast, the methods of electrocution and lethal injection were viewed as more reliable and consistent, as standardized protocols could ensure a more controlled approach to execution.

        "unwatermarked_sample": "Multiple life sentences are typically imposed when an individual is found guilty of multiple crimes, often serious ones, and the court determines that each crime warrants a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The primary purpose of such a sentence is to ensure that the person remains in prison for the remainder of their life, thus providing the most severe punishment for their crimes. This is often seen as a way to protect society from future violent or criminal acts by the offender. Additionally, multiple life sentences can serve as a deterrent to others who might otherwise commit similar crimes. It also provides compensation for the victims and their families by ensuring that the defendant will not be able to harm anyone further. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the concept of multiple life sentences is often associated with controversy and debate.

It can also discourage individuals from engaging in serious criminal behavior, as the very prospect of a repeated sentence can be a strong deterrent.\n\n3. **Revictimization Prevention**: Serial killers or individuals who are considered a significant threat to public safety are often given multiple life sentences to ensure that they receive intensive treatment while incarcerated and to prevent any further victimization of society.\n\n4. **Legal Precedent",

        "watermarked_sample": "In most legal systems around the globe, evidence obtained through illegal means is generally inadmissible in a criminal case. This is based on a principle of procedural fairness known as the exclusionary rule, which aims to prevent police misconduct and protect the rights of individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. The exclusionary rule has its roots in the United States Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable search and seizure. In addition to this, similar principles can be found in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada, the European Convention on Human Rights, and other fundamental legal instruments across Europe and worldwide. The exclusion of such evidence serves as a safeguard to ensure a fair judicial process and to prevent police from taking extreme actions to gather evidence at any cost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, where evidence obtained illegitimately can still be admitted if it can be proven to be necessary to prevent a more serious wrong (e.g., \"inevitable discovery\" or \"good faith\" exceptions).",

        "natural_text": "A huge portion of the harms caused by using a lot of drugs are directly related to the fact they’re illegal. Having the drugs be illegal to use ends up saddling a lot of people with criminal records that limit their access to education and employment - often perpetuating the conditions that led to a person taking the drugs to start with, and it drives the sales of the drugs to criminal organizations, dragging users into dealings with people committing other crimes. It also makes it more difficult for users to seek treatment for drug use, and limits treatment options.\nDecriminalizing drugs remove many of these harms, making it easier for those who want help to access it, and reducing the number of people who get formally marginalized by society due to criminal records who wind up taking drugs because their life has entered a new level of suckage.\nIt also takes away some of the “glamor” of drug use, presenting it as an illness, where people are sick and getting treated in a clinical setting, rather than having it be some sort of edgy and rebellious thing teenagers do.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": "The decriminalization of certain drugs, such as possession and use, rather than illegalization, can have several potential impacts on public health and society, which may lower rates of drug-related issues. Here are some ways this approach can help:\n\n1. **Increased Access to Treatment**: Decriminalization can reduce the barriers to seeking help for substance use disorders. When drugs are decriminalized, individuals who use drugs are less likely to fear legal repercussions and more likely to seek treatment to improve their health and well-being.\n\n2. **Focus on Harm Reduction**: This approach often goes hand in hand with harm reduction strategies. These strategies aim to minimize the negative consequences associated with drug use, such as HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, and overdose. Harm reduction programs can include needle exchange programs, safe consumption sites, and the distribution of naloxone (a drug that can reverse an opioid overdose).\n\n3. **Reduced Criminalization of Users**: Decriminalizing drug use can reduce the",

This means fewer individuals face arrest, incarceration, and negative consequences from using drugs. This can reduce stigma associated with substance use, encouraging people to access support services without fear of prosecution.\n\n**Access to Treatment:**\n\nDecriminalization can remove legal barriers to treatment, making it easier for individuals to seek help. This can lead to increased participation in treatment programs, particularly from those who previously feared legal repercussions.\n\n* **- **Education & Prevention:**** By focusing resources on prevention and education, decriminalization can foster a more informed society about the risks and realities of drug use.

        "natural_text": "The Constitution grants Congress the power “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes”.  But under the original interpretation of this clause, they couldn’t restrict commerce inside of a single state.  \nThis is why both the abolition of slavery and the prohibition of alcohol were done via constitutional amendment. Congress simply didn’t have the power to do so otherwise.\nThis changed with *Wickard v. Filburn*.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn\nThe basics of the case:\n>An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The US government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone \"interstate\" commerce\nThe Supreme Court disagreed.\n>The Court decided that Filburn's wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn's production.\nThis interpretation of the Commerce Clause granted Congress *way* more power to regulate the economy, since almost anything could be considered interstate commerce under the reasoning SCOTUS used in this case. \nThat reasoning is why Congress can, for example, criminalize the production and use of drugs like marijuana or heroin with legislation rather than requiring a constitutional amendment.\n*United States v. Lopez* somewhat curtailed this broad view of interstate commerce, but not much.  *Gonzales v. Raich* upheld the view of marijuana grown at home for personal use as being interstate commerce, for example.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": "Prohibition of alcohol was instituted through the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was enacted in 1920. Additionally, the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 1st, was ratified in 10 years, demonstrating a clear understanding of how to address the need for significant changes without undermining the basic principles of the Constitution through more than two amendments. There have been other federally outlawed substances, such as slavery (13th Amendment), alcohol during the Civil War (Prohibition of liquor during wartime by Congress in 1863), and narcotics (the Tariff of 1883 and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906) without amendments. However, the unique challenges and societal pressures surrounding the use of alcohol—including its role in social issues such as crime, health, and domestic violence—led to a push for Prohibition, which required an amendment to the Constitution. [[category:Constitutional",
        "watermarked_sample": "One common answer to this question is that Prohibition was established to address a deeply entrenched social problem that directly affected people's lives, as well as economic concerns stemming from a significant loss of tax revenue. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution established Prohibition of alcohol, but its enforcement through the Volsted Act of 1919 had a range of negative consequences and is seen as a key factor leading to its repeal through the 21st Amendment in 1933. This amendment was repealed because its provisions were deemed to have proven ineffective, with organized crime booming due to illegal alcohol production and sales, and public opinion becoming increasingly negative about Prohibition.\n\nThe lack of a similar constitutional amendment being necessary for other federal laws prohibiting certain activities can be attributed to different social and political contexts at the time the laws were established.

        "natural_text": "You can serve time “concurrently” or “consecutively” for multiple convictions. Someone serving concurrent 2-year sentences for burglary and weapons possession should in theory be out of jail in two years.  Someone serving a consecutive sentence for the same thing would in theory be out in four years. \nNow what people don’t know is that in some areas you get “credit” for every hour you don’t cause trouble in jail. So if you don’t cause trouble for an hour, you get credit for an additional hour of jail time.  So in the previous concurrent example the convict would be out in just one year and in the consecutive example he would be out in two years. \nHow the sentences are handed down is often dictated by state sentencing guidelines. The judge has a series of checks that determine the length of sentence and how it is to be served. If there is a prior criminal past that pushes the sentencing one way and if there is no history then it pushes it the other way. Things like employment, family in the community, job, home ownership, etc. can also play a role in sentencing.  \nFor most serious crimes parole or early release is also possible if a percentage of the sentence has been served (I believe like 75-85%).   So after 8.5 years of a 10-year sentence someone could be eligible for early release.  In particularly heinous crimes, or frequent convictions, the sentences are designed to prevent early release by assigning more years to a sentence and making it a consecutive sentence rather than concurrent.  \nSo a child rapist who accidentally kills their victim might only have gotten convicted for second degree murder, or maybe even just manslaughter.  Those would have significantly fewer years of potential punishment than first degree murder.  So for the rape the guy might only get 5-years and for manslaughter he’d get maybe 10-years. All total he could serve as little as just 5-years (remember he gets an hour of credit for every hour he serves with no trouble) and if the 5 and 10 year sentences are served concurrently then he would be out in no time. \nBy making the sentences consecutive he would serve as little as 7.5 years and as many as 15. \nBut a lot of it has to do with prior criminal history.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": "There are several reasons why prison sentences are often stacked upon eachother:\n\n1. **Cumulative Impact**: Stacking sentences means that each new sentence is served consecutively rather than concurrently with any previous ones, except for instances where a court might order \"concurrent\" sentences to run at the same time. This means that each additional sentence adds to the total time spent in prison, without overlap.\n\n2. **_Cumulative Offending Behavior**: Offenders who commit multiple crimes may be seen as posing a greater risk to society if they continue to break the law despite having already been convicted and incarcerated once. Stacking sentences can be a way to ensure that the individual remains in custody for a longer period to mitigate the risk of reoffending.\n\n3. **Deterrence**: For those who consider committing crimes, the prospect of accumulating years in prison for each offense can serve as a significant deterrent, potentially discouraging them from breaking the law.\n\n4. **Retribution**: Some legal systems may view the commission",
        "watermarked_sample": "Prison sentences are often \"stacked\" upon each other for several reasons:\n\n**Legal and Procedural Requirements**: In many legal systems, consecutive sentences are mandated by laws and statutes. For example, a judge might be required to impose a sentence that is a combination of two or more sentences if a person has been convicted of multiple crimes. This can be due to mandatory minimum sentences, consecutive sentencing laws, or the nature of the crimes themselves.\n\n**Offender Management**: Stacking sentences can be a tool used to enhance public safety by ensuring that offenders serve a significant period of time in prison. By running sentences consecutively, it can be challenging for offenders to be paroled or released until a longer period has passed.\n\nIn the context of federal sentencing laws in the United States, for instance:\n- **The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984** required that sentences be imposed on concurrent (running concurrently) or consecutive terms, unless otherwise specified by the court due to",

There were two charges of assault, one of kidnapping, and one of criminal attempt to commit a felony. Since Arbery died, each of those acts contributed to his death, and thus are each open to a felony murder charge. Not all of the accused were found guilty on all of them. For example, one of them was found not guilty on one of the assault charges, and thus also not guilty for the corresponding felony murder charge (but they were fond guilty of the other three felonies and other three felony murder charges).\nIn addition to the felony murder charges, they also faced a single charge of murder, which accounts for killing that single person.",

For example, in the United States, a person may be charged with first-degree murder or premeditated murder if there was planning or malice involved. In some jurisdictions, different terms for different levels of premeditation and intent may be used. In the absence of premeditated intent, a person could be charged with felony murder, where murder occurs during the commission of an extremely serious crime, such as robbery or kidnapping.

Additionally, if a defendant intentionally kills people sequentially due to a broader plan to eliminate multiple individuals, they could face multiple murder charges.

        "natural_text": "It depends on the state.  \nCalifornia, for example, will sentence people to death, but the governor has to actually order the execution to be carried out and none have in 15 years.  So when you get sentenced to death in California you go to death row, but never actually get executed because the governor never orders that to happen.\nIn other states its typically more of an issue of the types of appeals afforded to death penalty cases.  In a non-death penalty case you cannot typically introduce new evidence on appeal.  The only thing your appeal can concern is some error that occurred at trial.  You also only get one (1) appeal.  After that you can file something called a \"habeas motion\" but courts aren't obligated to hear those and most just shove them in a drawer and forget about them.  However, most states allow death penalty cases to appeal on the basis of new evidence.\nWhat this means is that if you claim to have any sort of new evidence that's relevant to your case, a court will stay your execution while it evaluates whatever it is that you've produced.  Getting a decision on that new evidence often takes a year or two, during which time you can't be executed.  The burden for what qualifies as new evidence is non-existent.  *Anything* that you purport to prove your innocence counts.  \nSomeone who wasn't born at the time of the murder but now claims they saw someone else do it?  That's new evidence.  DNA evidence that shows a mere 99.99999% chance that you committed the crime?  There's a .00001% chance that the DNA came from someone else so that's new evidence that the court *has* to consider before you can be executed.  Once they've denied your appeal, you get to keep appealing so long as you can continue to produce new evidence.\nThere are plenty of organizations that go out and actively find new witnesses or pay for additional evidence testing to stall out death penalty cases, so its often possible to stall out an execution until your right to appeal on the basis of new evidence is cut off.  *Typically* most states cut you off after either 5 or 10 years from the date of your conviction, so that's the point at which whatever administrative process is necessary to execute you begins moving foward.  \nSome states have shorter or longer cut offs, but typically when you see death row inmates dying of natural causes its because you're either in a California situation, where the death penalty exists in name only, or in a state that has a really long cut off for death row inmates being able to appeal their conviction on the basis of new evidence.",

These appeals are crucial to ensure that the condemned individual has had a fair trial and to address any potential legal error.\n\n2. **State Procedures**: Each state in the United States has its own set of rules and procedures for carrying out the death penalty. These processes can vary significantly and often involve multiple steps, including a period for the family and community to grieve, a review process, and a final execution preparation.\n\n3. **Resource Allocation**: Executing a person requires careful planning and coordination of resources, including equipment and personnel.

These appeals can be sought from higher courts within the state to federal courts and potentially even to the U.S. Supreme Court. The reviewing courts scrutinize every detail of the case, including procedural fairness, evidence admissibility, and potential misconduct by authorities or legal representatives.\n\n2. **Execution Moratoria**: In some jurisdictions, executive clemency, which can be granted by state governors or the President in federal cases, can also play a role.

Additionally, it can convey a sense of respect for the legal process.\n\n- **\"Appearance of Guilt\" Theory** - According to this theory, wearing prison-style attire can unconsciously reinforce the perception that the defendant is indeed guilty of the charges. The idea is that the defendant's appearance bears subtle clues suggesting that they might have something to hide or that they fit the profile of a criminal. This can potentially influence the jury's perception of guilt or innocence.\n\n**Practical Considerations**\n\nFor those with prior convictions",

The recognition of a person's mental disorder can also mitigate penalties if their crimes were committed as a result of their illness.

The legal threshold for determining impairment is often clearly defined, and the use of standardized tests (like breathalyzers) can establish a clear metric for intoxication. Texting and driving, on the other hand, may not fall into a clear legal category and can be more challenging to define and prosecute, as it involves a range of activities and does not have a universally accepted definition of \"impaired\" in relation to driving.\n\n2. **Perceived Risk and Severity**: DUI is generally associated with a higher perceived risk due to the concrete and well-documented correlation between alcohol/drug consumption and impaired driving.

They're asking a court to review the situation and confirm that they are, in fact, the legal owners of the Marvel copyrights in question.  This provides certainty to everyone involved.  For Disney, it prevents them from being sued 20 years from now and then owing money for every Marvel movie they've made in between.

Many businesses round up to the nearest round number to make calculations easier and to ensure that there are no small amounts that could lead to unnecessary precision issues.\n\n2. **Pricing Strategies**: In retail, prices are often set to make ends meet, with prices ending in a \"5\" to facilitate rounding up to a higher, whole dollar or a bigger denomination. This can be a subtle tactic to encourage buyers to purchase a slightly more expensive item that would otherwise fall within a different pricing range.\n\n3. **Taxes**: In some places where a sales tax is applied, rounding to the nearest whole dollar is common",

However, as a rule, this kind of scheme does not offer legitimate avenues for making profits through sales of genuine goods or services; as a result, their collapse usually leads to significant loss for investors.\n\nHere's a breakdown of a few key points about pyramid schemes:\n\n1. **Investment Model**: The primary source of new money comes from new investors rather from any actual profits from sales or legitimate business activity like traditional investment vehicles where investors are rewarded from company revenues.\n\n2. **Rewards to Early Investors**: Early investors are often promised high returns that are not sustainable into the",

At first glance it may seem that the total value should remain the same, but it doesn't. \nAs an exaggerated example, let's say the trading pair is BERT and ERNIE, and at the moment you create the BERT-ERNIE liquidity pool, both BERT and ERNIE are valued in other markets at $5 each. Let's say you put 10 BERT and 10 ERNIE in the pool. You contributed $50 + $50 = $100 of value to the pool. \nThen I buy 1 ERNIE from the pool, paying 1 BERT for it. Now the pool has 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT. If you were to withdraw your liquidity now, would the 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT you'd receive be worth as much as the 10 ERNIE and 10 BERT you deposited? Clearly the market has more demand for ERNIE than it does for BERT (as evidenced by the trade), so maybe ERNIE is now worth $5.50 while BERT is now worth $4.50. The pool, and your claim to it, is worth 9×$5.50 + 11×$4.50, or $99. Your impermanent loss (or divergence loss) is $1.\nPeople call it \"impermanent loss\" because the lost value can come back if sentiment for that trading pair swings the other way.

Conversely, if a country's economy is struggling and people are selling their currency to pay off debts or speculate on a devaluation, the currency's value can depreciate.\n\n2. **Interest Rates and Monetary Policy**: Central banks have significant influence over currency value through their monetary policies. When a central bank increases interest rates, it attracts foreign investors who seek higher returns on their investments. This increases the demand for the currency and can lead to its appreciation. Lower interest rates might have the opposite effect, making a currency less",

Here are some reasons why hyperinflation is bad:\n\n1. **Loss of Confidence in Currency**: When inflation rises to extremely high levels, it can lead to a rapid depreciation of the currency. This, in turn, can cause people to lose confidence in the currency, leading to a surge in the use of foreign currencies or commodities (like gold) as a store of value, further exacerbating the economic instability.\n\n2. **Distorted Economic Activity**: High inflation rates lead to economic distortions. Prices of goods and services become highly volatile, making it difficult for businesses to plan and make accurate financial projections. This instability can discourage investment and business activity, potentially leading to a contraction in the economy.\n\n3. **Decrease in Purchasing Power**: As inflation increases, the real value of money decreases, leading to higher prices for everyday goods and services.

It's value climbs to $100B but he only pays taxes on gains when he sells. So even as his stock has gained 10's of billions in value over the past year, he isn't taxed on that. Let's say he sells $10m worth of shares to cover living expenses, he pays capital gains taxes on that, which are lower than income taxes at top income bracket -- only 20% for incomes over $441k. So in this example, assuming Bezos' shares had 0 cost basis, his $10m sale would trigger a $2m tax bill. Not nothing, but basically a rounding error vs. his wealth.\nThe other way that some wealthy reduce taxable income is through a business. By deducting expenses \"for the business\" they can cut their taxable income and buy things with pre-tax dollars.

People like to blame inflation on the idea that we make print too much money, but it's more complex than just that. The current inflation spike we're seeing is, like many other things in the world today, because of covid and the the supply and demand problem.\nIn Economics 101 you learn of supply and demand. If there is a high supply and low demand for a good, the price of each individual good will be low. If there is high demand and low supply, the price for each individual good will be higher.\nFor the past year and a half consumers haven't been spending as much money. If people don't buy things, companies make less of them and stores stock less of them. (ie \"low demand\") However, people are now returning to old spending patterns, but the production has been slow to adjust. So the demand for goods has gone up without the supply to match it, thus the price of each individual good has gone up.\nThe second factor for the current inflation spike is a consequence of the governments efforts to keep the economy afloat when people weren't buying as much. Mainly this was done by the fed lowering interest rates to near 0%. That's a complex topic in and of itself as to what that actually means. However, for our purposes all you need to know is that near 0 interest rate means that people are taking out loans, primarily mortgages, to take advantage of the low interest and gain property. Unfortunately, the housing market is also limited which drives up the price for each home. \nAll this combines to make the current purchasing power of a dollar less than what it was, or at least make the market see it as such. That's not to say you should go out and try and buy things that hold their value. This kind of temporary inflation will normalize and it already has started to; at least in the housing market.",

Since then, these disruptions have persisted or even worsened due to factors such as the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and geopolitical tensions, which have further inflated costs for businesses and, consequently, for consumers.\n\n2. **Monetary Policies**: Central banks in many countries have pursued aggressive monetary policies, such as quantitative easing, to stimulate economic activity during the pandemic. While these policies helped stabilize economies in the short term, they can also lead to increased money supply, devaluing the currency and potentially driving up prices over time.\n\n3. **Post-Pandemic Economy**: As economies have reopened, demand for goods and services has surged, outpacing the ability of supply",

Derivatives can help entities (such as businesses, investors, and governments) hedge against potential losses that might result from changes in the value of an underlying asset, such as a commodity, security, or currency. By using derivatives, entities can reduce the potential negative impact of large movements in these assets.\n\n2. **Speculation**: Derivatives markets also allow traders and investors to speculate on the future movement of underlying assets. Speculation can lead to more efficient pricing of assets in the underlying market, as traders with different views on the market's future direction interact and adjust prices accordingly.\n\n3. **Leverage**: Derivatives can magnify gains or losses relative to the actual value of the underlying asset.

If they don't sell all the cars they buy, then they are loosing money paying for cars sitting on the dealership lot.  Every dealership is different, but many operate on a quota system, where each salesman is assigned a number of cars to sell during a certain period, say 50 cars per month.  Salesmen will be paid a percentage of the cost of each sale, plus a bonus if they sell the car for a relatively high price.  If a salesman is behind their target near the end of the month, they will be more desperate to sell the car, and may be willing to give up their high price bonus in order to meet their sales quota.  That said, not all dealerships operate on a quota system, and even if they do, there is no reason to believe that the quota countdown ends at the end of the month, it could be on the 15th, or the 5th, or whenever.  \nThe non-ELI5 answer is a lot more complicated, as there are different incentives for selling cars at the manufacturer, dealership, and salesman level, any or all of which will contribute to how willing they are to make you a good deal.",

This often results in more flexibility for customers to negotiate better deals or added incentives.\n\n3. **Budget Flexibility**: Many car buyers have their monthly budgets set around their income schedules, often aligning with the end of their work month or bi-weekly paychecks.

        "watermarked_sample": "It's generally considered to be a good idea to purchase a new car toward the end of a month due to incentives that dealers are likely to offer to clear month-end inventory.

This could lead to additional incentives or better pricing on current models or slightly older inventory to close out monthly targets.

For instance, they might mandate that certain denominations of coins are no longer minted or circulated, or they might impose restrictions on the minting and distribution of coins.\n\n2. **Economic Factors**: Economic conditions can impact the availability of coins. High inflation might lead to a decrease in the value of coins, which could discourage their use. Conversely, economic downturns or recessions could lead to increased demand for coins as people try to preserve their wealth.\n\n3. **Manufacturing Issues**: Delays or interruptions in the manufacturing process can result in a shortage of coins. This could be due to technical problems, labor issues, or raw material shortages.\n\n4. **Consumer Behavior**: Economic conditions (like the examples mentioned above) might influence consumer behavior, leading to changes in the way people use coins.

This process can be expensive. It typically requires specialized knowledge and equipment, and the cost of sourcing suitable components might be significant, especially for older or rare vehicle models. The cost of conversion can sometimes be higher than purchasing a new EV, making it a less cost-effective option.\n\n2. **Efficiency and Power Issues withICE Drivers:** Some traditional ice drivers are already very efficient and have high power outputs, making conversions necessary to match or exceed these performance levels. Retrofitting an ICE vehicle with similar performance can be challenging, as the existing engine's capabilities are already optimized for its intended purpose, and major modifications to match an EV's performance can be complex and expensive.",

Conversely, during periods of low inflation, or even deflation, they may reduce interest rates to stimulate borrowing, spending, and investment, which can help boost economic growth and, in turn, inflation.\n\n2. **Inflation Expectations**: If the general public expects low or moderate inflation, businesses and consumers may be more willing to borrow money at lower interest rates. This increased borrowing can help keep interest rates down.

By keeping interest rates low, central banks can encourage borrowing, investment, and consumption, which can help stabilize economic growth while still mitigating inflationary pressures.\n\n3. **Supply-Side Issues**: High inflation sometimes occurs due to supply-side constraints or shortages, where the supply of goods and services doesn't match the demand.

        "natural_text": "There are two major ways to calculate investment returns. Okay, there's dozens, but specifically with regard to your question what you're looking for is the difference between \"time-weighted\" and \"money-weighted\" returns. There are multiple formulas to determine both, and each have their uses. Each dollar you put in or take out is weighted to come out to an aggregate performance number, and it'll look different based on how you weight the dollars in/out. The general difference is that time-weighted return does not factor in the timing of additions/withdrawals, while money-weighted return does. Said another way, time-weighted return shows the return of an investment, money-weighted return shows the return of YOUR investment in that same thing.\nHere's an example. Let's say you buy ABC stock with $10K, then six months later ABC has fallen 50%. On that date, you add an additional $5K and buy ABC stock with it. Over the next six months, ABC rises 100%. If it goes down 50%, it has to rise 100% to get back to even, so ABC's return is flat over this year, and thus your return is also flat on the $10K. But, your return on the additional $5K is 100%. Time-weighted return strips out that lucky timing and measures only the performance of ABC, so your total time-weighted return is still flat on the whole $15K. But, your money-weighted return will be much higher than 0% because the return on the $5K was 100% and it isn't adjusted for.\nIf you didn't make any additions, then your money- and time-weighted returns will be the same. Since you've been contributing regularly, these two weighting methods will produce significantly different total return figures.",
        "unwatermarked_sample": "Time-weighted returns are a metric used to evaluate the performance of an investment over a period, taking into account the timing of contributions and withdrawals (including fees). \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n* **Time-Weighted Return (TWR):** This measures the true compounding effect of an investment strategy over time. It's calculated as the total return divided by the cumulative sum of 1 plus the daily (or relevant period) investment rate. TWR assumes consistent investment contributions and withdrawals. A key advantage is its neutrality towards varying contribution sizes and withdrawal schedules.\n* **Dollar-Weighted Return:** This calculates the profit generated by each investment dollar, focusing on the cumulative impact of investment contributions. It's more sensitive to changes in investment amounts over time.  \n\n* **Money-Weighted Return**: This is the total return an investor realizes after accounting for all cash flows (contributions, withdrawals, fees) as a percentage of the final account balance.  \n\n**Formula for TWR (",
